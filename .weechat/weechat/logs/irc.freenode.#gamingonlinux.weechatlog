2014-10-17 09:13:10	liamdawe	it has a far more interesting start than BL2
2014-10-17 09:13:18	liamdawe	and <3 the claptrap his skill is amusing
2014-10-17 09:13:29	mETz	You chose him?
2014-10-17 09:13:41	liamdawe	fuck yeah
2014-10-17 09:13:48	liamdawe	it gave me like 3-4 warnings though

2014-10-17 09:14:46	liamdawe	had no idea what to expect from his skill, but claptrap's skill is funny
2014-10-17 09:14:52	liamdawe	"ahhhh a mini clap trap, boom!"
2014-10-17 09:15:15	liamdawe	im enjoying TPS much more than BL2 just from the start and the character
2014-10-17 09:16:08	@Samsai	at least we won't all be playing as the same character
2014-10-17 09:16:09	hidekin	yes the start is a lot better than BL2 :-)
2014-10-17 09:17:07	liamdawe	it actually seems funnier too

2014-10-23 14:47:04	kkit	basically the difference is 'better loot'
2014-10-23 14:47:32	kkit	and you're more powerful since you have many more skill points, but enemies' health and shields get heavily buffed
2014-10-23 14:47:47	kkit	basically playing at op8, and maybe even lv72, isn't much fun
2014-10-23 14:47:59	kkit	the enemies take too long to kill
2014-10-23 14:49:03	kkit	i like the presequel too, but it sure as hell isn't worth 60 bucks
2014-10-23 14:49:40	kkit	but i got bl2 goty for 15 or 20, so i don't feel ripped off on average
2014-10-23 14:49:53	kkit	i'm not buying the dlc til it's on sale, that's for sure

2014-10-23 14:52:15	stqn	what is op8 ?
2014-10-23 14:52:23	tadzik	heh, I've heard the same thing about CivBE
2014-10-23 14:52:39	tadzik	cool and all, but not worth the asking price
2014-10-23 14:52:51	tadzik	inb4 "I told you games are overpriced"
2014-10-23 14:53:05	von	dunno really
2014-10-23 14:53:12	stqn	I probably won’t buy Civ BE because Civ5 isn’t much fun.
2014-10-23 14:53:34	von	I've heard opinions from Escapist's reviewer and TB
2014-10-23 14:53:38	von	both compared the game to SMAC
2014-10-23 14:54:09	kkit	uh so there are 3 playthroughs, normal, true vault hunter mode, ultimate vault hunter mode, each unlocked after completing the story missions of the previous mode. after uvhm, if you have the dlc, you can unlock overpower levels by completing a gauntlet of enemies
2014-10-23 14:54:25	kkit	this levels up the loot you can get, but buffs the enemies a little more each time
2014-10-23 14:54:37	stqn	kkit: ah… ok
2014-10-23 14:54:43	tadzik	so like doing anything else in borderlands
2014-10-23 14:54:44	kkit	uvhm already requires obnoxious use of slag, op levels mainly make it worse
2014-10-23 14:54:48	stqn	I’ll never get there :)
2014-10-23 14:54:56	kkit	borderlands is a grindfest loot rpg
2014-10-23 14:55:05	tadzik	"sweet, a 1000 damage sniper rifle.... aaaaand the enemies now have 2x the health they had before"
2014-10-23 14:55:17	kkit	yeah but that's how traditional RPGs play too
2014-10-23 14:55:21	tadzik	err
2014-10-23 14:55:25	tadzik	it's hardly an rpg, mind yu
2014-10-23 14:55:31	kkit	i know
2014-10-23 14:55:32	tadzik	you don't play a role, you assume a role
2014-10-23 14:55:49	tadzik	and yes, it's kinda true what you say :)
2014-10-23 14:56:02	stqn	like all computer RPGs?
2014-10-23 14:56:07	kkit	uh, you assume a role in every final fantasy game
2014-10-23 14:56:36	kkit	i guess i don't mean that it's dungeons and dragons-style roleplaying
2014-10-23 14:56:43	tadzik	I have my very own definition of an RPG and if jRPGs don't fall under it, so be it :P

2014-10-23 14:57:12	kkit	then you know what i mean and are just being pedantic
2014-10-23 14:57:21	tadzik	what I came up with is: an RPG is when a dialogue option can determine an outcome of a quest
2014-10-23 14:57:32	tadzik	this covers what I consider RPGs and excludes what I don't :P
2014-10-23 14:57:55	kkit	ok, an ARG, an Assumed Role Game
2014-10-23 14:57:56	tadzik	but apart from my pedantry, I think BL is more like a hack-n-slash, or perhaps shoot-and-blow-up
2014-10-23 14:58:04	tadzik	I like that
2014-10-23 14:58:12	kkit	it's first person diablo

2014-10-23 14:58:18	tadzik	exactly :)
2014-10-23 14:59:23	kkit	it's great for when i want mindless amusement
2014-10-23 15:01:13	kkit	i wanted to like the witcher 2, but the combat was just not enjoyable
2014-10-23 15:01:22	tadzik	yeah, it was crazy imbalanced
2014-10-23 15:01:31	kkit	and getting lost all the fucking time didn't help either
2014-10-23 15:01:39	tadzik	but I liked it enough to go through it
2014-10-23 15:01:58	kkit	i quit after the elf guy had some scene with the guy who hates the elf guy
2014-10-23 15:02:28	tadzik	heh
2014-10-23 15:02:44	kkit	i couldn't find my way out of a forest so i quit and deleted the game
2014-10-23 15:02:49	tadzik	I can pinpoint when that was, but: how many sex scenes did you see before that?
2014-10-23 15:02:55	kkit	3 or 4?
2014-10-23 15:03:05	tadzik	alrighty

2014-10-23 15:04:20	tadzik	you actually have to care about it, unlike BL2 where I'd shoot it in packs of 10 if I could
2014-10-23 15:04:23	neffo	i've got like 60 hours in that game

2014-10-23 15:05:08	tadzik	it was less combat focused, because the combat was beyond trivial, so ended up being more story based

2014-10-28 15:25:24	stqn	just wanted to make sure steam and games would work
2014-10-28 15:25:26	mirv_	I've not tried funtoo yet, but I do hear it's very, very similar to gentoo
2014-10-28 15:25:41	stqn	to be honest I don’t know what the difference is
2014-10-28 15:26:04	mirv_	a few portage additions, and maybe some less breakage so often (or so I hear)
2014-10-28 15:26:08	stqn	It’s just that they seem to be more anti-systemd than gentoo.
2014-10-28 15:26:26	mirv_	btw, I don't use portage with steam
2014-10-28 15:26:40	mirv_	I just keep it in my home dir, and run it from there
2014-10-28 15:26:53	mirv_	I don't trust putting steam in the system directories
2014-10-28 15:27:26	stqn	does it change anything? it still runs with your user’s permissions…
2014-10-28 15:27:32	mirv_	yep
2014-10-28 15:27:51	mirv_	updates itself fine, but doesn't touch /usr/ or anything
2014-10-28 15:28:08	stqn	well it saves everything in .steam anyway, I think
2014-10-28 15:28:35	mirv_	not sure what it'll do from the portage management actually
2014-10-28 15:28:50	mirv_	regardless, if you have problems, know that you don't need to run it through portage
2014-10-28 15:29:09	von	stqn, ${HOME}/.local/share/Steam by default
2014-10-28 15:29:30	mirv_	and I recommend using -bin packages for firefox and/or chromium, and libreoffice-bin
2014-10-28 15:29:44	mirv_	because all those take damned near forever to compile
2014-10-28 15:29:46	von	compiling chromium from source....

2014-10-28 15:30:21	mirv_	I actually run firefox aurora from my own user home directory (well, a sub-dir thereof) too
2014-10-28 15:30:46	von	I want to switch back to chromium, but it wouldn't play nice with my window manager :<
2014-10-28 15:33:16	mirv_	I keep going back to firefox - just personal preference really
2014-10-28 15:33:31	stqn	I’m gonna try lxqt because I saw that Xfce depends on Gtk3, and I’d like to avoid that.
2014-10-28 15:33:46	mirv_	stqn, can't really avoid gtk3
2014-10-28 15:34:00	mirv_	but you can have gtk2 & gtk3 running fine alongside each other

2014-10-28 15:36:19	jaycee_	gtk is probably the least evil of the gui systems
2014-10-28 15:36:40	stqn	mirv_: I’m considering that.

2014-10-28 15:37:03	mirv_	stqn, it's nice, but if you run the latest & greatest, expect a few things to break every now and then
2014-10-28 15:37:07	stqn	mirv_: but there is no « Enlightenment » DE that I can see…
2014-10-28 15:37:16	mirv_	stqn, need to use an overlay
2014-10-28 15:37:24	mirv_	stqn, for that, read up on "layman"
2014-10-28 15:37:44	mirv_	and this site I find useful: http://gpo.zugaina.org/Newest

2014-10-28 15:38:20	stqn	mirv_: for what do I need an overlay?
2014-10-28 15:38:47	mirv_	stqn, sometimes there are things you want to install that aren't in the main official portage tree
2014-10-28 15:39:16	mirv_	enlightenment is there, but it can lag behind the latest release sometimes

2014-10-28 15:39:21	stqn	ah ok
2014-10-28 15:39:31	stqn	overlays are like PPAs?
2014-10-28 15:39:39	mirv_	(which is actually 0.19.1, not 1.0.14)
2014-10-28 15:39:42	mirv_	yes
2014-10-28 15:40:28	mirv_	history lesson: E16 was around for ages, and was always registered as "enlightenment-0.16.x"
2014-10-28 15:40:43	mirv_	gentoo eventually decided E17 wasn't going to appear, and went with enlightenment-1.x.x
2014-10-28 15:40:49	mirv_	then E17 appeared...
2014-10-28 15:41:00	mirv_	and it was kept in portage as enlightenment-0.17.x
2014-10-28 15:41:11	mirv_	it's messed up and annoys me
2014-10-28 15:43:01	stqn	strange idea to change the version numbers from what upstream decided
2014-10-28 15:43:07	von	the fuck is wrong with BL2
2014-10-28 15:43:08	mirv_	stqn, as I'm only back for about 20minutes tonight, if you've any questions and I'm online (and in the room), just ask and I'll help with whatever I can
2014-10-28 15:43:17	von	fps drops to 33 on lowest settings
2014-10-28 15:43:33	von	i5, GTX660 =/
2014-10-28 15:43:53	mirv_	gentoo/funtoo has a steep learning curve, but it's very customisable, and very flexible once you get used to it
2014-10-28 15:44:06	stqn	mirv_: thanks, it will take several days (months?) for me to migrate anyway.
2014-10-28 15:44:12	von	I realize that performance on linux can be slower, but 4 times slower?
2014-10-28 15:44:23	mirv_	a month or two to start getting the hang of it properly, yeah
2014-10-28 15:45:04	stqn	von: did you enable __GL_lalalala =1 to get multithreaded opengl?
2014-10-28 15:45:09	mirv_	von, I don't play it under windows, but pretty sure I get more than that under linux (phenom II X6, radeon 6950)
2014-10-28 15:45:39	stqn	von: and are you using ondemand? tweaking it might help a little
2014-10-28 15:46:12	stqn	I have i3 + GTX 660 and BL2 is running pretty well on mid-something settings
2014-10-28 15:46:40	mirv_	BL2 even runs nicely on medium with my kaveri
2014-10-28 15:46:41	von	stqn, you mean multithreaded shaders?
2014-10-28 15:47:26	mirv_	but BL2 (well, Unreal Engine 3) relies pretty heavily on streaming....which might be why enabling the multithreading stuff from nvidia helps so much
2014-10-28 15:48:18	stqn	von: __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command%
2014-10-28 15:50:18	von	holy fuck
2014-10-28 15:50:24	von	it actually helps O_O

2014-10-28 15:56:38	von	solid 60 fps at max settings

2014-10-28 16:29:11	von	I can understand an attempt to make the game really hard and all
2014-10-28 16:29:21	von	but controls from 20 years ago? srsly?
2014-10-28 16:33:42	Dezponia	von: I dont think you're the target audiance as a BUNCH of others who are more into those kinds of games utterly loved it to death :) Pressumably they also used a gamepad incase you werent
2014-10-28 16:34:32	von	it's not the case of picking the right controller
2014-10-28 16:34:49	von	controls feel sluggish and not precise enough
2014-10-28 16:34:49	Dezponia	Not my style of game but there are still people who really desire the oldschool SNES-hard games when done properly, and trusting their opinion on it they seem to love it
2014-10-28 16:35:53	von	maybe I'm not the target audience idndeed
2014-10-28 16:36:04	von	judging by reviews on steam, it's very well received
2014-10-28 16:36:32	Dezponia	Yepp
2014-10-28 16:36:58	Dezponia	von: One could say its a game crafted for a very specific audiance, but for that audiance it was an amazing game :P
2014-10-28 16:39:47	Dezponia	Ahahaha, watching a Lets Player (Helloween4545) play through Alien Isolation and the game bugged out and set him on fire forever without taking damage :P
2014-10-28 16:40:14	Dezponia	And since the game is amazing in that its one of those that actually render the body he happily walked around with all his limbs on fire
2014-10-28 16:40:38	von	lol
2014-10-28 16:41:00	Dezponia	On the bright side it has arguably the best fire effects I've ever seen in a game
2014-10-28 16:41:03	von	I was debating buying the game, but then I thought how much I dislike booting into windows these days
2014-10-28 16:42:27	Dezponia	I dont have any windows computers around but its still a facinating game. Not only is it a proper, well made Alien game which is rare in of itself but the enviorments and graphics are just stunning
2014-10-28 16:42:58	Dezponia	They've really managed to craft the 80's scifi feel to perfection in that game and its SOOO refeshing
2014-10-28 16:43:29	von	oh wow
2014-10-28 16:43:48	von	now enhanced ui for Civ5 shows the area that can be worked by the city when the settler is selected

2014-10-28 16:47:11	Dezponia	Civ V suffered the infemous "500 turns" bug where it could just crash and die pretty much without fail :P

2014-10-28 16:50:52	BTRE	I'm not really disappointed in BE and I've played thousands of hours of civ in my lifetime.
2014-10-28 16:51:10	BTRE	It's not as great as it could have been, sure, but it's still fun.
2014-10-28 16:51:20	Dezponia	I think people wanted something more like Alpha Centari
2014-10-28 16:51:35	Dezponia	And less like Civ in space
2014-10-28 16:51:35	BTRE	Yeah, but it was clear from the start that it wasn't going to be SMAC
2014-10-28 16:51:47	von	I don't get though
2014-10-28 16:51:52	von	why build wonders at all?
2014-10-28 16:52:13	von	they seem like average buildings with painfully huge production requirements
2014-10-28 16:52:34	Dezponia	BTRE: Sure... but maybe it SHOULD've been SMAC and let Civ V ride for a bit longer? Was there really a desperate need for a new entery into the Civ series so soon?
2014-10-28 16:53:06	von	so soon?
2014-10-28 16:53:16	von	I think Civ5 was released liek...  4 years ago?

2014-10-28 16:55:04	von	fair point
2014-10-28 16:55:05	BTRE	There goes my uptime thanks to my dog being a little too happy and pulling the power cord.
2014-10-28 16:55:11	von	sadly I've failed to get into SMAC
2014-10-28 16:55:16	von	dat UI
2014-10-28 16:55:25	BTRE	Honestly, yeah, SMAC is dated in many ways.
2014-10-28 16:55:36	Dezponia	BTRE: Clearly you need to make the dog sader. Its the only solution
2014-10-28 16:56:17	BTRE	Can't stay mad at him for being lovely.
2014-10-28 16:56:20	BTRE	So it's fine.
2014-10-28 16:58:21	BTRE	At any rate, BE isn't trying to be SMAC. It does its own thing with the affinities and virtues as well with how you interact with the world.
2014-10-28 16:58:46	BTRE	I think that as it stands now, it's better than vanilla civ 5 and with additional content it can really become a gem.
2014-10-28 16:59:04	Dezponia	I'm going to hit the hay for the night
2014-10-28 16:59:19	BTRE	See ya.
2014-10-28 17:00:01	von	I agree
2014-10-28 17:00:14	von	Civ5 took a couple of years to get where it is now
2014-10-28 17:00:27	von	I'd expect that to be the case with CivBE too
2014-10-28 17:04:45	BTRE	Yeah
2014-10-28 17:04:54	BTRE	Civ 5 was a mess at launch.
2014-10-28 17:05:11	BTRE	It lacked polish, the maritime city states were too op and stuff like that
2014-10-28 17:05:42	BTRE	I still played it to death because I'm a civ addict but it's important to note the shortcomings.
2014-10-28 17:06:22	BTRE	BE has done something really well though: made multiplayer much more interesting.
2014-10-28 17:06:54	BTRE	I played over the weekend and found that both the AI and the other two players I was playing with managed to stay competitive through the game. And the affinity system worked pretty well there.
2014-10-28 17:08:01	von	I wonder if it would be better for affinities to be mutually exclusive
2014-10-28 17:08:50	BTRE	Nah, it already balances well with giving you units that aren't as good/not letting you build the exclusive buildings.
2014-10-28 17:10:33	von	True.  For some reason I had health shortage all game long.  Happiness is much easier to gain in civ 5, right?
2014-10-28 17:11:02	BTRE	On normal, sure.
2014-10-28 17:11:11	BTRE	Because of the inclusion of religions and their bonuses
2014-10-28 17:11:27	BTRE	One of the gripes I have with BE is that health isn't that important.
2014-10-28 17:11:52	von	Yeah, I've noticed
2014-10-28 17:11:57	BTRE	Rebels would spawn with low happiness in civ 5 and cities would defect
2014-10-28 17:12:07	BTRE	BE is just... less culture and production
2014-10-28 17:12:17	von	Maybe because it's more difficult to gain?

2014-10-28 17:13:08	BTRE	Hmm, some of the virtues really help with health
2014-10-28 17:13:27	BTRE	but it isn't that hard to keep around 0-10 health for most of the game if you don't expand too fast
2014-10-28 17:13:36	von	Yeah, in each tree there are at least a couple
2014-10-28 17:16:32	BTRE	Well, I'm confident that firaxis will deal with all of this in balance patches. I just hope they do something with how tedious trade is and maybe add more quests/options for buildings.
2014-10-28 17:16:55	BTRE	I hope that by the time it's out on Linux, it'll mostly be sorted.
2014-10-28 17:17:09	von	And wonders
2014-10-28 17:17:26	BTRE	Yeah, wonders are rather underwhelming.
2014-10-28 17:17:34	BTRE	They need to make most of them a bit more attractive.
2014-10-28 17:17:43	BTRE	Maybe have unique questlines tied to each.
2014-10-28 17:17:47	von	They are basically useless =/

2014-10-29 11:08:05	von	jaycee_, sure, let me fire up my laptop
2014-10-29 11:09:20	Sik	jaycee_: two AMD GPUs here (laptop), I don't have both enabled though (didn't bother installing that yet), is that OK?
2014-10-29 11:09:33	Sik	(iirc lspci still should show the info of both GPUs)
2014-10-29 11:09:37	jaycee_	sik, sure, lets see what comes out
2014-10-29 11:09:46	jaycee_	mail to peter.mulholland@vpltd.com please
2014-10-29 11:11:32	Sik	Sent
2014-10-29 11:12:06	jaycee_	cheers. working on improving our crashreporter system, and knowing how to detect multiple gpu's would be useful
2014-10-29 11:12:58	jaycee_	good, looks like what i hoped, i can just look for devices of class "VGA Compatible controller" and list those
2014-10-29 11:13:00	Sik	One of these days I need to enable the second GPU, but not without first getting some back-up in case the OS install breaks again >.>
2014-10-29 11:13:38	Sik	(I don't want to be left computer-less again :P)
2014-10-29 11:14:07	jaycee_	yeah linux is a right PITA with that stuff. i hate it every time i have to swap between intel gpu and amd gpu on my main system for testing
2014-10-29 11:14:21	jaycee_	usually end up juggling bollocks at a terminal before x11 will start again
2014-10-29 11:18:45	Sik	I usually break things so badly I need to reinstall the OS...
2014-10-29 11:19:33	von	jaycee_, sent
2014-10-29 11:19:36	Sik	For instance, I can't change the video driver right now, because if I do then Linux will see the other GPU and try to use that instead, rendering X unusable
2014-10-29 11:19:54	Sik	Another good reason to enable that GPU, but again gonna take precautions first :P

2014-10-29 11:29:38	jaycee_	its annoying that i cant have intel enabled when i boot into linux. if i do, x11 automatically decides to load something to do with it, and fglrx breaks
2014-10-29 11:29:59	jaycee_	"its fglrx's fault" is the excuse ive had, but well, nvidia does it too. its as simple as linux cannot handle multiple gpu's well

2014-10-29 11:30:43	jaycee_	that just causes more hassle when i want to use the intel
2014-10-29 11:30:59	jaycee_	ideally, id like to do that and have it choosable from grub
2014-10-29 11:31:33	jaycee_	windows on the same hardware doesnt care of course, itll happily use either
2014-10-29 11:31:37	jaycee_	or both

2014-10-29 11:42:48	von	if you hate linux so much, why develop for it?
2014-10-29 11:43:01	jaycee_	didnt say i hated it, but it is a flaw
2014-10-29 11:43:13	von	one of many, yes
2014-10-29 11:43:35	jaycee_	multi gpu just doesnt work under it without bodges
2014-10-29 11:44:47	jaycee_	just wondering how, given multiple gpu's, i could enumerate the GL capabilities of each. but it seems it cant be done
2014-10-29 11:45:04	jaycee_	not unless theyre assigned to seperate X11 displays which is rarely the case
2014-10-29 11:45:07	von	I think the main reason is X server is ancient
2014-10-29 11:45:21	von	and was developed long before multiple GPUs were a thing
2014-10-29 11:45:43	von	hell, long before multiple screens were a thing
2014-10-29 11:45:46	jaycee_	well they sort of had the right idea with X displays, but the big flaw was not being able to move windows against them
2014-10-29 11:45:51	jaycee_	between them, even
2014-10-29 11:46:26	jaycee_	and yes, x11 shouldve died years ago... pretty much what NeXT decided when they started writing NeXTStep
2014-10-29 11:48:05	 *	von hopes to see wayland ready to use some day
2014-10-29 11:48:15	jaycee_	yes and i hope they get it right
2014-10-29 11:48:17	von	along with propriatary driver support
2014-10-29 11:48:21	jaycee_	but i reckon its going to be another 5 years yet
2014-10-29 11:48:31	von	hopefully, yeah
2014-10-29 11:48:38	von	it can be worse
2014-10-29 11:48:49	jaycee_	and yes, they should make proprietary drivers less hassle with wayland, because nvidia and amd are not going to back down on that
2014-10-29 11:49:12	jaycee_	the linux kernel guys should grow up and stop deliberately moving goalposts to try to frustrate nvidia into opening their driver
2014-10-29 11:49:14	Sik	Am I the only one upset that Wayland didn't also specify a standard set of GUI controls and such? That every program is expected to provide its own GUI seems backwards to me (and yes, I'm aware this is a flaw with X too)
2014-10-29 11:49:36	DerRidda	?_?
2014-10-29 11:49:38	von	err
2014-10-29 11:49:41	von	it's toolkit's work
2014-10-29 11:49:43	BTRE	Hopefully the kernel guys will never budge.
2014-10-29 11:49:44	jaycee_	Sik, maybe, but that particular design feature is too engrained into Linux to switch away from
2014-10-29 11:49:46	von	not window server
2014-10-29 11:49:58	jaycee_	BTRE, it will be Linux's loss for refusing to do so, not nvidias
2014-10-29 11:50:06	BTRE	Nah, I doubt it.
2014-10-29 11:50:09	von	wayland is built to do one thing: place windows on the screen
2014-10-29 11:50:17	BTRE	Linux has been fine for the last 20 years and it'll continue to be fine.
2014-10-29 11:50:31	jaycee_	BTRE, yes it will. noone except the hardcore cares. everyone else just wants working high quality graphics acceleration
2014-10-29 11:50:35	von	it shouldn't care about window contents, make one thing that does its job, and does it well
2014-10-29 11:50:35	Sik	von: but it's not like there's a specific GUI everything hooks into, every program can end up using its own toolkit, which is a mess
2014-10-29 11:50:36	Sik	:/
2014-10-29 11:50:48	von	Sik, the backside of choice power
2014-10-29 11:51:01	von	if you want everything to look the same, switch to OSX
2014-10-29 11:51:11	BTRE	We'll see. I doubt it'll change so longs Linus and others like him are around.

2014-10-29 11:51:40	DerRidda	I really think the multitude of toolkits is the smallest of our problems. More things look native on Linux in spite of that then they do on Windows where nobody cares about UI consistency.

2014-10-29 11:52:02	jaycee_	i wouldnt agree

2014-10-29 11:52:13	von	UI consistency may be nice, but I really hate how Gnome does it
2014-10-29 11:52:18	jaycee_	notice how they look stoneage
2014-10-29 11:52:19	von	hidez moar options!
2014-10-29 11:52:42	DerRidda	That's more of a problem with the individual programs.
2014-10-29 11:52:48	jaycee_	and you have a marvellous inconsistency between gtk apps, qt apps, and <insert other toolkit> apps
2014-10-29 11:53:13	jaycee_	DerRidda, yes, but it is created because there is no standard gui toolkit to use
2014-10-29 11:53:31	Sik	von: ugh
2014-10-29 11:53:43	Sik	Although I don't think that's related to consistency
2014-10-29 11:53:53	Sik	More to "our users are dumb so let's dumb down everything"
2014-10-29 11:53:55	DerRidda	I never said it's good on Linux still better than Windows where not even the title bar is native for a lot of new programs.
2014-10-29 11:53:57	Sik	*More like
2014-10-29 11:54:01	DerRidda	Steam is a bad offender as well.
2014-10-29 11:54:10	Sik	Which only shows they're the ones dumb
2014-10-29 11:54:12	DerRidda	Look alike everywhere, look native nowhere.
2014-10-29 11:55:07	jaycee_	that is one of the strongpoints of osx, stuff tends to look native, as not having the cocoa look is strongly discouraged
2014-10-29 11:55:16	jaycee_	and it helps that the cocoa ui toolkit is very good
2014-10-29 11:57:46	jaycee_	as for steam, well, steam is what happens when you let games developers program an app :)
2014-10-29 11:58:28	DerRidda	The worst thing about Steam: It's still best in class with all its many faults.
2014-10-29 11:59:02	von	I'd say it's the only one in class =/
2014-10-29 11:59:10	stqn	Not all game developers are stupid like Valve though.
2014-10-29 11:59:11	von	well, there is Origin, yeah, but not on linux
2014-10-29 11:59:18	von	and Desura is defunct basically
2014-10-29 12:00:00	DerRidda	I remember running Desura all day, every day on Linux and buying there frequently.
2014-10-29 12:00:14	jaycee_	steam is also excellent from a delivery point of view, having used steamworks
2014-10-29 12:00:56	jaycee_	they could do with writing the next generation of steam from scratch though, as a portable app, instead of as a windows app thats kinda been fudged onto the other systems
2014-10-29 12:03:28	nykac-	hmm, BL2 runs better w/ steam overlay
2014-10-29 12:03:52	nykac-	w/o it it seems to randomly come out of full-screen and toggles resolution when you press <enter>
2014-10-29 12:04:22	nykac-	jaycee_: yeah, it'd be interesting to see what they could do if they started from scratch
2014-10-29 12:04:53	jaycee_	theyd probably still keep the custom look
2014-10-29 12:05:29	nykac-	jaycee_: sure, I'd honestly prefer it if the made cef less of a core part of steam

2014-10-29 12:05:57	jaycee_	cef?
2014-10-29 12:06:14	von	or rather, the way full screen games tend to minimize every time you alt tab from them =/
2014-10-29 12:06:20	nykac-	jaycee_: chromium embeded framework
2014-10-29 12:06:34	nykac-	jaycee_: much of steam is just a fancy wrapper around their website
2014-10-29 12:06:52	jaycee_	some of it is yes
2014-10-29 12:07:01	jaycee_	chromiums not a bad choice
2014-10-29 12:07:04	DerRidda	More of it could be tbh.
2014-10-29 12:07:05	jaycee_	heh, v1 of steam used IE :)
2014-10-29 12:07:27	jaycee_	what made them go to webkit was that they were fed up of getting stung by IE's security vulns :)
2014-10-29 12:08:19	nykac-	jaycee_: I'm not saying not use chromium, but have it be less of webkit and more native, and perhaps make it work better when valve's servers get hammered

2014-10-29 12:09:04	DerRidda	But back then I always kept Steam in minimal mode as purely a game launcher.

2014-10-29 12:11:11	jaycee_	to be honest the feel im getting is that most linux people would be against a client

2014-10-29 12:13:31	jaycee_	i think we'll probably go with a lightweight client that has no store etc in it, but functions mostly as a download/install/update tool. i dunno yet
2014-10-29 12:13:38	jaycee_	nykac-, no idea yet, its only speculative
2014-10-29 12:13:49	jaycee_	i dont think it'd be worth doing for just our own stuff
2014-10-29 12:17:10	jaycee_	ive no idea how we plan to sell outside of steam yet :)
2014-10-29 12:17:48	jaycee_	witcher 2 is on gog and steam, stronghold 3 i think is just steam at the moment (probably no great loss ;)
2014-10-29 12:18:26	jaycee_	theres one game we've said "no" to steam until the original publisher agrees a sensible revenue split, which atm they wont
2014-10-29 12:18:44	Sik	<von> or rather, the way full screen games tend to minimize every time you alt tab from them =/ ← Every program that goes fullscreen does that :S (even the freaking image viewer)
2014-10-29 12:18:48	stqn	Clients like Steam are much better than tar.gz archives, just click to install, click to play… But if we have one client per publisher it will be annoying. “What do I have to launch to play this game already?”
2014-10-29 12:19:17	jaycee_	stqn, if we do have our own im thinking of making a client which is a one-shot type thing
2014-10-29 12:19:27	nykac-	stqn: you could have the client add the game to steam as non-steam launcher
2014-10-29 12:19:31	jaycee_	it'll download/install one game and thats it
2014-10-29 12:20:08	von	liek many mmorpg or doto-like game launchers?
2014-10-29 12:20:16	stqn	jaycee_: like the WoW launcher then I guess?
2014-10-29 12:20:23	stqn	eh
2014-10-29 12:20:28	jaycee_	never played WoW i am proud to say ;)
2014-10-29 12:20:32	stqn	ahah
2014-10-29 12:20:40	stqn	well it’s an updater.
2014-10-29 12:20:53	stqn	also shows news
2014-10-29 12:20:59	jaycee_	but i guess so. it'd be a small download from our website, which then goes on to download the game itself from the CDN and install it
2014-10-29 12:21:00	von	both nwn installments had their own launchers
2014-10-29 12:21:33	jaycee_	and yeah i could probably make it bundle an update checker you can run manually
2014-10-29 12:22:14	jaycee_	or you could install our client which handles download/install/update of any games on your account automatically. so two options
2014-10-29 12:22:19	jaycee_	in theory :)
2014-10-29 12:23:22	jaycee_	and with some sort of purchase check on the standalone installer which could be the interesting bit

2014-10-29 14:33:15	gkeen	hmm is it possible to modify the mic input with pulseaudio.. change the voice etc ?
2014-10-29 14:38:39	Sik	Huh, no idea
2014-10-29 14:39:25	Sik	Maybe you can reroute the mic input through another program (and use that program's output as the new primary input)
2014-10-29 14:39:42	Sik	But I'm no expert with PulseAudio so maybe I'm saying pure BS :P
2014-10-29 14:40:32	nykac-	gkeen: use jack
2014-10-29 14:40:42	nykac-	gkeen: and use pulseaudio's jack plugin
2014-10-29 14:40:58	nykac-	gkeen: mic -> jack (with audio effect setup) -> pulse
2014-10-29 14:41:06	gkeen	nykac-: can it make me sound like darth vader on skype?
2014-10-29 14:41:22	nykac-	gkeen: I'm sure you could find an effect
2014-10-29 14:41:45	kkit	that makes the big assumption that you can make sense of how to make jack work
2014-10-29 14:42:03	nykac-	kkit: its not that hard
2014-10-29 14:42:07	nykac-	kkit: start qjackctl
2014-10-29 14:42:21	nykac-	kkit: click start, and then connect things
2014-10-29 14:43:51	kkit	guess i have to look at it some more. i only got as far as getting it to start, and then idjc took care of everything else.

2014-10-29 18:04:10	flesk__	stqn: I made it to the fifth world or something but the background really blends with obstacles there, which made it especially awful.

2014-10-29 18:05:22	flesk__	The rest is relatively crisp.
2014-10-29 18:05:30	stqn	also it was not 60 FPS, very annoying for a side-scroller

2014-10-30 01:56:32	von	hi
2014-10-30 02:02:37	BitRic	what games are you guys enjoying lately?
2014-10-30 02:02:49	von	IWDEE releases today
2014-10-30 02:03:06	von	hopefully I'll be playing it tonight
2014-10-30 02:04:03	BitRic	oh man, i have BG1 for ages in my steam library and never touched it :/
2014-10-30 02:04:31	von	shame on you, sir
2014-10-30 02:05:15	von	although I've got to admit, pretty often playing low level characters in a dnd based game is not that fun and you cap at a pretty low level in BG1
2014-10-30 02:06:07	BitRic	i wish i could play NWN1 & 2. i have old copies of it but win only editions
2014-10-30 02:06:33	von	you can install a native version of nwn if you have the windows copy
2014-10-30 02:07:27	BitRic	as far as i know, this only works with nwn1
2014-10-30 02:07:34	von	of course
2014-10-30 02:07:44	BitRic	:/
2014-10-30 02:07:55	von	you can also run NWN2 on wine
2014-10-30 02:08:11	BitRic	i don't know why, but i don't like wine at all
2014-10-30 02:08:13	von	though the game is so poorly optimized you need a beast of a machine to run it on wine
2014-10-30 02:08:31	von	me neither, but as long as the game runs stable and don't require me to shut down native steam, I'm fine with it
2014-10-30 02:08:42	BitRic	i have a decent gaming laptop (1 year old), shouldn't be a problem at all
2014-10-30 02:09:03	von	I've had pretty low fps on my i5 and GTX660 home pc
2014-10-30 02:09:12	von	on medium settings
2014-10-30 02:09:22	BitRic	i7 with an 880m here
2014-10-30 02:09:34	BitRic	can play all new games with high settings without problems
2014-10-30 02:10:14	von	give it a try then, iirc both nwn games run pretty much out of the box on wine
2014-10-30 02:10:49	BitRic	i think i'll try it over GoL, don't want to mess things up
2014-10-30 02:11:46	BitRic	i use linux now for good 6 months constantly now, and just miss a few games, sadly there doesn't seem to be that good alternatives for them
2014-10-30 02:11:59	DrMcCoy	turning on shadows in NWN2 kills fps
2014-10-30 02:13:43	BitRic	DrMcCoy, just read that, thx for mentioning

2014-10-30 02:53:03	liamdawe	only stuff i will be personally doing right now though, there's a lot of stuff i do behind the scenes anyway though
2014-10-30 02:53:33	liamdawe	im also going for a lot of real life job interviews at the moment, so my time is limited anyway, another one tomorrow infact

2014-10-30 02:56:02	liamdawe	flesk_: any low-end job right now since i was a home dad while my now-ex partner worked (and i did gol), so to any employer they will look at me and just be like "well you haven't worked for a long time"
2014-10-30 02:56:08	liamdawe	so my only options are low end jobbies

2014-10-30 02:59:03	liamdawe	^
2014-10-30 02:59:08	flesk_	I've been talking to a job recruiter lately and mentioned that I occationally write articles for the page. He thought that sounded great. But maybe it's different because it's not my primary skill and because English isn't my native language.
2014-10-30 02:59:36	liamdawe	probably why then :)
2014-10-30 02:59:37	flesk_	Christmas job = Santa?
2014-10-30 02:59:46	liamdawe	haha no
2014-10-30 02:59:52	DerRidda	hoho no
2014-10-30 02:59:54	liamdawe	seasonal temp job
2014-10-30 03:00:10	DerRidda	At an Amazon ware house?
2014-10-30 03:00:17	flesk_	DerRidda: Probably right about that.
2014-10-30 03:00:24	DerRidda	Those are going around these days.
2014-10-30 03:00:31	liamdawe	royal mail data entry
2014-10-30 03:00:37	flesk_	The "old gray men" comment I mean.
2014-10-30 03:00:43	liamdawe	basically sit at a pc and confirm the address for post their scanners cant read
2014-10-30 03:00:51	liamdawe	piss easy job
2014-10-30 03:01:04	flesk_	Ah, right. They probably need a ton more people before the holidays.
2014-10-30 03:01:06	liamdawe	so im hoping if i can collect my ID today they still have positions open
2014-10-30 03:01:10	liamdawe	yeah they need 800 people
2014-10-30 03:01:30	flesk_	So you don't currently have any ID at all?
2014-10-30 03:01:41	DerRidda	So it's related, the increased Christmas shopping that makes Amazon hire temp ware house workers creates the mail traffic the Royal Mail needs extra hands for.
2014-10-30 03:02:11	liamdawe	flesk_: i have a provisional drivers license and a birth certificate, but as it's royal mail they require a "full" birth certificate with parents names on it, not the short one which i have
2014-10-30 03:02:19	liamdawe	so i had to pay for a full one :/
2014-10-30 03:02:47	flesk_	That blue GoL bird: Is it some kind of penguin? And who designed it?
2014-10-30 03:03:08	DerRidda	Somebody who really liked Poochy on The Simpsons.

2014-10-30 03:11:24	BitRic	no, it's just that i'm getting really frustrated with the german speaking community
2014-10-30 03:11:35	tadzik	oh?
2014-10-30 03:11:46	BitRic	most of them aren't capable of writing/reading/speaking english
2014-10-30 03:12:08	DerRidda	Are they?
2014-10-30 03:12:25	von	what's so unusual about this?
2014-10-30 03:12:25	BitRic	most of them i know
2014-10-30 03:12:46	von	I barely meet any Russians who speak English outside my line of work
2014-10-30 03:12:51	DerRidda	If so, slap 'em from me. They have at least 6 years of mandatory English education in school.
2014-10-30 03:13:10	BitRic	i'm austrian myself and thought about translating things for them
2014-10-30 03:13:24	BitRic	so i wrote a mail to the editors, but didn't press send yet
2014-10-30 03:13:25	von	why not, if you like translating
2014-10-30 03:13:34	 *	von hates it immensely
2014-10-30 03:13:40	tadzik	hey, you're not half percent as bad as russians in csgo :)
2014-10-30 03:14:02	DerRidda	Don't do it for free.
2014-10-30 03:14:21	von	tadzik, sometimes I have to translate for my teammates in doto
2014-10-30 03:14:26	tadzik	but to be fair, polish are catching up as hard as they can
2014-10-30 03:14:27	von	I hate those times ._.
2014-10-30 03:14:49	tadzik	tf2 is such a wonderland ;_;
2014-10-30 03:14:51	DerRidda	How is English education in Russian schools?
2014-10-30 03:14:54	von	bad
2014-10-30 03:15:06	von	pretty much non existant since nobody cares enough
2014-10-30 03:15:10	DerRidda	Mandatory at all or optional and bad on top?
2014-10-30 03:15:26	von	mostly mandatory, but really bad
2014-10-30 03:15:49	BitRic	so would you please stop me from sending it
2014-10-30 03:15:54	von	but to be fair, even many professional courses are suffering from the same set of problems
2014-10-30 03:16:12	DerRidda	How to guarantee your entire nation an economic disadvantage 101 - Step 1: Fluff up on English education in your school.
2014-10-30 03:16:19	von	lol
2014-10-30 03:16:33	von	the thing is
2014-10-30 03:16:39	jaycee_	yeah but you can laugh at our attempts to teach foreign language too ;)
2014-10-30 03:16:40	von	unless you want it, you won't learn language
2014-10-30 03:16:51	von	and no amounts of education can fix that
2014-10-30 03:17:03	jaycee_	starts from age 12 and lasts till about age 14 unless you choose to study it beyond. typically french, but sometimes german
2014-10-30 03:17:19	jaycee_	i learned more german from doing game ports where the comments were in german :)
2014-10-30 03:17:32	von	I enjoy using English in my everyday life, I think in it about half of the time, have been for so long I don't really remember when I started to
2014-10-30 03:17:46	DerRidda	True just about any kind of education.
2014-10-30 03:20:10	DerRidda	Also what's the Russian meme where they constantly say balalaika to foreigners? I've seen that more than once.
2014-10-30 03:20:24	tadzik	:D
2014-10-30 03:20:27	tadzik	that sounds hilarous

2014-10-30 04:52:09	liamdawe	von: it's not, but i just saw a post on it and mentioned it, why does everything need to be relevant?
2014-10-30 04:52:39	von	I don't really get why announcing sexual preferences is a thing =/
2014-10-30 04:53:39	liamdawe	because of the insane stupid thoughts people have, like attacking people because they are gay, taking away their rights, etc
2014-10-30 04:53:53	tadzik	it's because some people still consider it weird and condemnable
2014-10-30 04:53:59	flesk_	Yeah, it's important for visibility.
2014-10-30 04:53:59	liamdawe	it's seen as a brave move to come out
2014-10-30 04:54:00	tadzik	like everything alien and unknown
2014-10-30 04:54:31	flesk_	Kids growing up needs to see that there's not something wrong with them for being different.
2014-10-30 04:54:36	von	now anything said against him will be considered an attack because he's gay
2014-10-30 04:54:39	Dezponia	Indeed. visibility is important for those of us who dont follow the hetro-norm
2014-10-30 04:54:44	von	good for defense I guess
2014-10-30 04:55:11	kkit	von: that's just not true
2014-10-30 04:55:26	liamdawe	it will be a lot of free press for apple, people will probably gain new respect for the guy too
2014-10-30 04:55:31	tadzik	people look weird at gays cos they still have the "normal people aren't gay" mindset

2014-10-30 04:55:37	Dezponia	von: I HIGHLY doubt that he'll use it like that unless the attack specifically mentions him beeing gay. It is increddibly disrespectful to assume people will use the gay community as a sheidl
2014-10-30 04:58:29	von	sure, whatever. But waving it like a flag kinda makes me doubt the intention.
2014-10-30 04:59:02	von	good for publicity though, can't argue with that
2014-10-30 04:59:53	kkit	it's also important for normalizing homosexuality in the US

2014-10-30 05:02:43	Dezponia	I think hes doing the right thing and I support him fully in this. Even if I might hate what his company does. :) The visibility it gives to GLBT issues cant be understated. And kkit is right, the day there is no news value in these things will be a victory
2014-10-30 05:03:47	Dezponia	Yepp. I seriously doubt it. If anyone will be using it as a sheild it'll be idiot third party apple lovers who will use anything to defent their beloved brand. And those people are as much part of the problem as the ones against GLBT

2014-10-30 05:35:42	DrMcCoy	tadzik: Yes?
2014-10-30 05:35:52	tadzik	DrMcCoy: didn't you manage to play Dreamfall successfully?
2014-10-30 05:35:58	DrMcCoy	Oh
2014-10-30 05:36:07	DrMcCoy	Beamboom: Yes, I managed to get Dreamfall Chapters to work no problem
2014-10-30 05:36:15	DrMcCoy	Well, the performance is horrible
2014-10-30 05:36:54	DrMcCoy	And there were a few graphical glitches, but those were fixed. For Nvidia, at least; I hear AMD cards still have some
2014-10-30 05:36:56	Happy-Ferret	Preach it to the choir! I get 20 FPS on the lowest setting, on my Mac Pro 2012 with a GTX 680.
2014-10-30 05:37:17	DrMcCoy	Also, ~/.config/RedThreadGames\\DreamfallChapters/
2014-10-30 05:37:25	DrMcCoy	I.e. literal \ in the path...
2014-10-30 05:38:44	DrMcCoy	Beamboom: What do you mean, it "just doesn't play on Linux"? Because I read about a lot of people who have it running on Linux
2014-10-30 05:43:15	Beamboom	The mouse input
2014-10-30 05:43:33	DrMcCoy	The mouse input is completely normal and fine
2014-10-30 05:44:00	Beamboom	for starters, it just doesn't match the miage. To change settings, I have to move the mouse like 20 centimeters to the left of the thing I try to click on
2014-10-30 05:44:12	Beamboom	s/miage/image/
2014-10-30 05:44:13	GolliumBot	Beamboom meant to say: for starters, it just doesn't match the image. To change settings, I have to move the mouse like 20 centimeters to the left of the thing I try to click on
2014-10-30 05:44:23	DrMcCoy	I have no problems like that here
2014-10-30 05:44:36	DrMcCoy	And that's the first I heard about it
2014-10-30 05:44:43	Beamboom	secondly,. for some strange reason the FIRST time I ran it, it seemd to start correctly on m,y maibn screen (of the two minotors I got)
2014-10-30 05:45:37	Beamboom	then, second time I started it (due to the mouse issues) it rendered halv-way on screen one (like it tried to span the image across both) only the second screen is still there wit6h the desktop
2014-10-30 05:46:01	-->	jhw (~jhw@unaffiliated/jhw) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-10-30 05:46:21	Beamboom	so now I got half the screen and a mouse input that is totally screwed, and I can't even start the game. And the controller input doesn't work either
2014-10-30 05:47:35	DrMcCoy	Sounds to me like an issue with dual monitors (which I don't have, because my monitors are separate X screens)
2014-10-30 05:47:50	DrMcCoy	Have you tried disabling one monitor?
2014-10-30 05:48:44	Beamboom	Yeah first thing I tried, but to no effect , I even rebooted with one screen, still draws half the image. It's like once the config settings are done the are *done*
2014-10-30 05:49:10	Beamboom	And I tell you, this is just *so* classical Unity experience.
2014-10-30 05:49:32	DrMcCoy	Try deleting ~/.config/unity3d/Red Thread Games/ , I guess?
2014-10-30 05:49:47	DrMcCoy	And/or ~/.config/RedThreadGames\\DreamfallChapters/
2014-10-30 05:50:19	Raven67854	Lol that \\
2014-10-30 05:50:26	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, you have separate x11 screens per monitor? i bet that screws with a lot of games
2014-10-30 05:50:26	DrMcCoy	Yeah...
2014-10-30 05:50:26	Beamboom	Aha - I was searching under .steam to find a darn config file to tweak
2014-10-30 05:50:36	jaycee_	or rather, i bet that means you end up with games only finding one display
2014-10-30 05:50:37	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Nope, it does exactly what I want it to do
2014-10-30 05:50:48	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: It runs on the monitor I start the game on
2014-10-30 05:50:55	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Except for SDL2, because SDL2 tries to be smart
2014-10-30 05:51:06	DrMcCoy	SDL2 forces the game onto the first monitor
2014-10-30 05:51:20	jaycee_	doesnt sdl2 read an env var for that?
2014-10-30 05:51:23	Beamboom	But there is a slight relief to see that when I booted Windows, while the game technically works, there are some *major* graphical glitches. Like, masterfully bad. Ligthing effects that looks totally bonkers, weird shit flying around that I *think* were supposed to be effects.
2014-10-30 05:51:58	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Dunno if there is. Last I crawled through the code I didn't find anything to change that behaviour
2014-10-30 05:52:09	Beamboom	But man do that engine start to bug the white out of my eyes nowadays. Worst part is, it's probably not even the engines fault, but crappy developers choosing it for its accessibility.

2014-10-30 05:53:06	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Was also funny when I did that hack to put Ogre into SDL2 for one of my projects. SDL2 put the window onto the first monitor, while Ogre tried to create the GL context on the second monitor. Segfault.
2014-10-30 05:53:54	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, hm apparently SDL2 should respect the DISPLAY env var
2014-10-30 05:54:02	DrMcCoy	Doesn't
2014-10-30 05:54:12	jaycee_	but who knows, x11 is a fucking awful system
2014-10-30 05:54:29	jaycee_	sooner it dies in a fire the better
2014-10-30 05:54:43	DrMcCoy	But yeah, issues like games trying to be smart and stretching, or switching off my second monitor, or bullshit like that is why I have the monitors run separate X screens
2014-10-30 05:55:06	Raven67854	mmm I run into that issue a lot with games made in lwjgl
2014-10-30 05:55:12	jaycee_	the whole xinerama/xrandr mess
2014-10-30 05:55:16	DrMcCoy	I don't want the games to do that. I want them to use one monitor while I have, say, IRC and mailcheck, continue to run on the second monitor
2014-10-30 05:55:28	Raven67854	They get my "total screen resolution" and put that onto 1 of my screens. Makes for a very odd experiance
2014-10-30 05:55:51	jaycee_	Raven67854, yeah thats what happens if you dont have working xinerarma or xrandr
2014-10-30 05:55:57	DrMcCoy	And then switch to the second monitor with a keyboard combo, much about in IRC and have the game continue to run on the first monitor
2014-10-30 05:56:04	DrMcCoy	muck*
2014-10-30 05:56:16	Raven67854	Only happens jaycee_ with a few games. I have plenty of other games that work just fine. It's great
2014-10-30 05:56:17	DrMcCoy	So really, the separate X screen is perfect
2014-10-30 05:56:19	Raven67854	But eh

2014-10-30 05:59:30	jaycee_	in fact ive no idea how youre supposed to handle multiple gpu types on linux with GL
2014-10-30 05:59:45	jaycee_	it seems to me as if you cant
2014-10-30 05:59:59	DrMcCoy	Frankly, I have no idea
2014-10-30 06:00:33	jaycee_	youd have to know exactly which libGL.so to open i guess
2014-10-30 06:00:59	jaycee_	i dunno how optimus works either, i assume the libGL.so there is some sort of router
2014-10-30 06:01:55	Raven67854	optimus is strange to get working. Install drivers -> install bumblebee -> install bumblebee-primus -> enjoy

2014-10-30 06:03:03	Raven67854	Going with a lovely hack
2014-10-30 06:03:19	jaycee_	though for gl, on windows, OpenGL32.dll is a router lib anyway that routes calls through to the appropriate ICD

2014-10-30 06:56:35	jaycee_	along the lines of "if you come here illegally, no matter if youre claiming asylum, get lost. If you've come here to sponge instead of working, get lost. If you come here, you live by our laws and rules and culture, dont like it ? get lost"

2014-10-30 06:57:10	jaycee_	mirv_, well thats the same anywhere
2014-10-30 06:58:01	mirv_	problem is, they get people in leaky boats, and literally tow them and leave them at the edge of australian territorial waters
2014-10-30 06:58:21	jaycee_	what are they supposed to do with them? grant them asylum?
2014-10-30 06:58:32	DrMcCoy	Of course
2014-10-30 06:58:49	mirv_	no, but they can send them somewhere without the risk of drowning

2014-10-30 06:59:09	DrMcCoy	No human being is illegal.
2014-10-30 06:59:21	mirv_	jaycee_, deals already made in Malaysia, and elsewhere, to send them
2014-10-30 06:59:40	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, the problem with asylum seekers, is that only a small percentage of them are actually legitimately claiming asylum
2014-10-30 06:59:51	jaycee_	the rest are just after sponging off a country that hands out free stuff
2014-10-30 07:00:03	mirv_	that aside, Australia is meant to abide by international law, which includes a duty of care to people in its territorial waters
2014-10-30 07:00:29	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: That's what I'm saying: I completely disagree that "illegitimate" claimants exists, as a concept
2014-10-30 07:00:38	DrMcCoy	Open borders for all
2014-10-30 07:00:44	mirv_	I have nothing against sending them somewhere else - but not by just shoving their boats to a "we don't care" location in the ocean
2014-10-30 07:01:13	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, wait until you live in a place besieged by such people
2014-10-30 07:01:35	mirv_	and again, the government is doing everything in its power to prevent the media reporting on the situation
2014-10-30 07:01:44	jaycee_	we get tons of them and the only reason they come here instead of stopping in the other countries they have to pass through to get to us, is because those countries dont give them free housing, free healthcare, free money etc etc
2014-10-30 07:01:47	jaycee_	and we do
2014-10-30 07:01:51	mirv_	if that doesn't make you worried about their intentions....well, damn
2014-10-30 07:02:06	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: You do understand that you are talking about people, right? Not animals, not things
2014-10-30 07:02:19	pdq	the govt are the ones sponging off the people, not the other way around :P
2014-10-30 07:02:21	jaycee_	yes, and ? what about the people here ?
2014-10-30 07:02:45	jaycee_	dont you think this country's citizens, born here, worked here, paid tax here, have more rights to those resources ?
2014-10-30 07:02:58	DrMcCoy	The people here could do with being less racist
2014-10-30 07:03:04	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: No, I don't
2014-10-30 07:03:22	jaycee_	its got nothing to do with race, i dont care where they come from. i would object if it was people from the UK going to some other country to do the same thing
2014-10-30 07:03:32	jaycee_	a country has a duty to its own citizens first
2014-10-30 07:03:38	DrMcCoy	Fuck that
2014-10-30 07:03:44	mirv_	not at the expense of human rights violations, it doesn't
2014-10-30 07:04:06	BTRE	First world hypocrisy.
2014-10-30 07:04:08	BTRE	That's all it is.
2014-10-30 07:04:09	liamdawe	if someone comes from another country to ours, don't they then become our citizens? just because they were born in another country doesn't mean they can't join another
2014-10-30 07:04:15	mirv_	the way something is done is as important as what is done
2014-10-30 07:04:22	jaycee_	liamdawe, theres a legal process for that
2014-10-30 07:04:24	BTRE	The British Empire subjugated how many millions of people for how many hundreds of years?
2014-10-30 07:04:31	liamdawe	jaycee_: and most of that is bullshit
2014-10-30 07:04:45	jaycee_	liamdawe, regardless, it is a legal process, every country has one
2014-10-30 07:05:09	jaycee_	i have no problem with legal immigration
2014-10-30 07:05:11	BTRE	I have little sympathy for people who speak of their resources and their people as somehow deserving more when they have had a contentious colonial past.
2014-10-30 07:05:42	mirv_	screw what happened 100 years ago
2014-10-30 07:05:44	mirv_	what matters is now
2014-10-30 07:05:45	jaycee_	BTRE, if you want to go back far enough in history, should we be against italians because of the Romans? Against the scandinavian countries because of the Vikings ?
2014-10-30 07:05:57	BTRE	That's really not the same
2014-10-30 07:06:04	BTRE	This is stuff within living memory.
2014-10-30 07:06:16	mirv_	alright, this conversation is headed there, so let's just get it over with....
2014-10-30 07:06:19	mirv_	Germany
2014-10-30 07:06:35	jaycee_	BTRE, should we be against America then because of how they treated black people?
2014-10-30 07:06:47	jaycee_	or yeah, against Germany because of the Nazi's ?
2014-10-30 07:06:49	BTRE	We should be against people who claim that race isn't an issue in America.
2014-10-30 07:06:50	jaycee_	what rubbish
2014-10-30 07:07:02	BTRE	Because of its history of discrimination and repression.
2014-10-30 07:07:04	liamdawe	can we go back to talking about fun games now :P
2014-10-30 07:07:13	 *	liamdawe hides
2014-10-30 07:07:16	tadzik	'fraid knot :)
2014-10-30 07:07:29	mirv_	liamdawe, meh, borderlands 2 is getting less & less fun
2014-10-30 07:07:31	tadzik	I got confused about what this discussion is about
2014-10-30 07:07:50	mirv_	I may have to move on to another game soon
2014-10-30 07:08:29	liamdawe	mirv_: play with friends, gets way more fun then, had a total blast playing with samsai and others
2014-10-30 07:08:49	mirv_	liamdawe, what is this....friends...you speak of?
2014-10-30 07:08:53	jaycee_	always better than playing with yourself.. er... i mean...
2014-10-30 07:08:54	jaycee_	;)
2014-10-30 07:09:09	von	anything gets moar fun with friends
2014-10-30 07:09:18	Raven67854	Not civ
2014-10-30 07:09:25	liamdawe	mirv_: e-friends like us :P
2014-10-30 07:09:31	Raven67854	Unless they don't take forever to end turn
2014-10-30 07:09:49	mirv_	liamdawe, sadly, when I'm free to play games, most other people are asleep
2014-10-30 07:09:59	Raven67854	mirv_, I'm not
2014-10-30 07:10:01	Raven67854	So hows that
2014-10-30 07:10:07	liamdawe	mirv_: well when you move to the uk you will be in my timezone :P
2014-10-30 07:10:14	BTRE	Raven67854, that is a reason to have dual monitors. Friends take their time, and I'll be watching something or browsing the web while waiting.
2014-10-30 07:10:18	Raven67854	liamdawe, he's what 1 hour ahead of you?
2014-10-30 07:10:22	liamdawe	wait is was you mirv_ moving wasn't it?
2014-10-30 07:10:25	Raven67854	BTRE, I have 3 but it's still boring
2014-10-30 07:10:28	mirv_	if my work will even produce their letter of intent to employ, grrrrrr
2014-10-30 07:10:44	Raven67854	BTRE, I want to end turn and get on with what I'm doing hehe :p
2014-10-30 07:10:45	mirv_	liamdawe, yeah, work is just dragging it arse right now
2014-10-30 07:10:50	mirv_	wanted to move mid-January
2014-10-30 07:10:55	liamdawe	mirv_: what time zone are you in atm?
2014-10-30 07:10:56	BTRE	Ah, well, I'm generally patient.
2014-10-30 07:10:59	mirv_	delayed to at least mid-February right now
2014-10-30 07:11:04	liamdawe	ouch
2014-10-30 07:11:07	BTRE	Besides
2014-10-30 07:11:15	BTRE	You can use the downtime to conspire with the other humans.
2014-10-30 07:11:20	Raven67854	BTRE, Humans suck
2014-10-30 07:11:22	Raven67854	Fuck that
2014-10-30 07:11:24	mirv_	I'm in Berlin - but "free to play games" is actually in the morning before work normally
2014-10-30 07:11:31	BTRE	Aye, they do. But they suck less than AI in providing a challenge.
2014-10-30 07:11:43	Raven67854	Not all of them
2014-10-30 07:11:51	mirv_	or next week, the boss is away, mwuhahahahaha
2014-10-30 07:11:52	Raven67854	AI would prove a better challenge than von
2014-10-30 07:11:57	liamdawe	ah yeah you are only an hour ahead
2014-10-30 07:12:02	BTRE	I had loads of fun playing BE multiplayer. A huge step up from Civ 5 balance-wise and competitiveness-wise.
2014-10-30 07:12:10	von	yep
2014-10-30 07:12:27	Raven67854	BTRE, yeah I had a lot of fun as well. I just hate waiting for people to end turn
2014-10-30 07:12:37	von	then set the limit of 30 seconds!
2014-10-30 07:12:43	Raven67854	haha
2014-10-30 07:12:46	BTRE	Raven67854, such is life. And yeah, set a turn limit.
2014-10-30 07:12:48	Raven67854	Gonna start with 2 minute turns
2014-10-30 07:12:52	von	game quickly derails into chaotic mess
2014-10-30 07:12:58	Raven67854	yep
2014-10-30 07:13:06	Raven67854	With the way the UI is 30 seconds isn't enough
2014-10-30 07:13:10	-->	psymin (~psymin@ali.hydeco.com) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-10-30 07:13:21	BTRE	Yeah, can't believe they dropped the ball so hard on the UI.
2014-10-30 07:13:23	Raven67854	Like the way they still handle trade routes *rolls eyes*
2014-10-30 07:13:25	BTRE	Hopefully it'll get better.
2014-10-30 07:13:33	tadzik	yeah, sure
2014-10-30 07:13:38	tadzik	just like focus jumping was solved in BE
2014-10-30 07:13:41	Raven67854	BTRE, Well I looked through the scripts.. Energy is still gold and aliens are barbarians
2014-10-30 07:13:43	Raven67854	It's a very lazy game
2014-10-30 07:13:49	Raven67854	It's a good game sure. But it's very lazy
2014-10-30 07:13:51	BTRE	to be fair
2014-10-30 07:13:58	BTRE	they have legacy code all the way back to the first civ
2014-10-30 07:14:01	BTRE	not even joking
2014-10-30 07:14:04	von	ui is still better than Civ5
2014-10-30 07:14:09	liamdawe	BTRE: how do you know?
2014-10-30 07:14:10	Raven67854	BTRE, It's not even the same engine
2014-10-30 07:14:16	BTRE	No, hold on a sec
2014-10-30 07:14:20	Raven67854	and the scripting language is not the same as in Civ4
2014-10-30 07:15:00	BTRE	Hm, the page I saw this on isn't loading.
2014-10-30 07:15:07	Raven67854	That's still not the same thing
2014-10-30 07:15:11	DrMcCoy	mirv_: When your boss is away, that means more xoreos time, right? ;)
2014-10-30 07:15:13	Raven67854	It's just general lazyness
2014-10-30 07:15:17	Raven67854	It's my biggest issue with CivBE
2014-10-30 07:15:20	BTRE	It's more like routines and logic, from what I read.
2014-10-30 07:15:22	Raven67854	They had so much time to make it
2014-10-30 07:15:37	tadzik	Raven67854: don't worry, they put tons of work into the upcoming DLCs
2014-10-30 07:15:37	Raven67854	And a fair bit is just a lazy reskin in some aspects
2014-10-30 07:15:44	Raven67854	tadzik, yeah that is what I'm afraid of
2014-10-30 07:15:54	Raven67854	Honestly if I had to recommend a 4x game similar to alpha centauri
2014-10-30 07:15:58	tadzik	this will keep working as long as we keep falling for it
2014-10-30 07:15:58	Raven67854	Pandora is much better
2014-10-30 07:16:13	Raven67854	Pandora is awesome but I have nobody to play it with
2014-10-30 07:16:21	Raven67854	Pandora with the expansion is even more awesome :D
2014-10-30 07:16:44	liamdawe	mmm i did like Pandora
2014-10-30 07:16:51	Raven67854	Gotta get the expansion then
2014-10-30 07:16:57	Raven67854	You can finally do stuff with the water tiles
2014-10-30 07:17:00	liamdawe	it seemed a bit faster paced than civ to
2014-10-30 07:17:05	liamdawe	too*
2014-10-30 07:17:13	mirv_	DrMcCoy, yes...maybe
2014-10-30 07:17:18	mirv_	if I can get all my work done this week
2014-10-30 07:17:20	Raven67854	Because the engine is retarded and doesn't freeze/fuck up when you hit end turn
2014-10-30 07:17:24	BTRE	Raven67854, liamdawe http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/227041/Building_Beyond_Earth_atop_the_Civilization_codebase.php

2014-10-30 07:17:27	DrMcCoy	mirv_: :)
2014-10-30 07:17:30	BTRE	page is a bit wonky to load
2014-10-30 07:17:32	Raven67854	There's a bug in Civ5 where the game can freeze for 2 minutes
2014-10-30 07:17:35	Raven67854	When it's checking pathing
2014-10-30 07:17:54	mirv_	DrMcCoy, sadly, I spent most of the week dealing with AES-CMAC and people who can't write proper test vectors
2014-10-30 07:18:00	mirv_	delayed me quite a bit
2014-10-30 07:18:25	mirv_	I'm going to wander off again before I start to rage
2014-10-30 07:18:27	Raven67854	BTRE, the issue I have with that. Is that they willingly moved legacy code over. I mean if it works fine nothing wrong with it. I really have no issues with that
2014-10-30 07:18:34	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Aww
2014-10-30 07:18:37	Raven67854	But CivBE is literally a reskin in a great deal of cases
2014-10-30 07:18:50	BTRE	I don't disagree necessarily.
2014-10-30 07:19:01	Raven67854	It's not a bad game
2014-10-30 07:19:07	Raven67854	I just expect more from them
2014-10-30 07:19:31	Raven67854	Also it's nothing like alpha centuari and during the entire announcement up to release phase they should of never mentionted alpha centuari
2014-10-30 07:19:37	BTRE	I was pointing out that the fact that they have stuff in the xml files isn't necessarily lazy just part of their legacy system
2014-10-30 07:19:48	Raven67854	BTRE, I wasn't just referring to the XML files
2014-10-30 07:20:06	tadzik	surely the engine team is just working their asses off to write a good nextgen opengl renderer /s
2014-10-30 07:20:13	Raven67854	tadzik, no
2014-10-30 07:20:16	tadzik	/s
2014-10-30 07:20:24	Raven67854	Engine team is busy adding mantle and fixing bugs
2014-10-30 07:20:30	BTRE	Ehhhhh
2014-10-30 07:20:37	BTRE	Well there may be some truth in that
2014-10-30 07:20:45	BTRE	That they're working on opengl
2014-10-30 07:20:49	jaycee_	cant exactly write a next gen opengl renderer until next gen opengl is out :)
2014-10-30 07:20:56	Raven67854	jaycee_, that to
2014-10-30 07:20:59	Raven67854	BTRE, I doubt it
2014-10-30 07:21:02	Raven67854	Apsyr is doing the port
2014-10-30 07:21:07	BTRE	because at one of the firaxicon panels they mentioned if any opengl engineers were about to come up if they wanted a job
2014-10-30 07:21:18	Raven67854	That could be for a future title though
2014-10-30 07:21:21	BTRE	So it's on their radar at least.
2014-10-30 07:21:40	Raven67854	Hell they could be planning to bring civ to consoles again
2014-10-30 07:21:42	 *	Raven67854 shudders
2014-10-30 07:21:55	jaycee_	if it was consoles they wouldnt be wanting GL guys
2014-10-30 07:21:55	BTRE	They already did recently, with Revolutions 2.
2014-10-30 07:21:58	Raven67854	Or the iOS versions of civ
2014-10-30 07:22:04	Raven67854	BTRE, no we won't speak of that
2014-10-30 07:22:19	Raven67854	jaycee_, or the iOS versions of civ
2014-10-30 07:22:28	jaycee_	ew :)
2014-10-30 07:22:43	jaycee_	maybe on ipad it'd work i spose
2014-10-30 07:22:45	Raven67854	I had forgotten how bad the console versions were
2014-10-30 07:22:47	liamdawe	writing my first gol article for nearly a month, lolwut
2014-10-30 07:22:49	jaycee_	and android tablets
2014-10-30 07:23:03	Raven67854	jaycee_, apparently it's pretty bad
2014-10-30 07:23:10	Raven67854	Not because of the platform.. Just the game is bad

2014-10-30 11:41:30	Happy-Ferret	When I get out at 5 in the morning, hunger is my least problem. At that time, all I need is sugar and fat.
2014-10-30 11:42:02	Happy-Ferret	Those 99 cents burgers solved that issue, for a time.
2014-10-30 11:43:08	DrMcCoy	I'd rather get a sausage cheese croissant from a bakery :P

2014-10-30 15:02:45	flesk__	I've played through the first three levels so far and I'm guessing the game is around 3-4 hours in total, depending on whether or not there are optional goals that are harder.
2014-10-30 15:03:01	flesk__	Bean's Quest? No, that doesn't ring any bells. Old game?

2014-10-30 15:11:58	disharmonic	It can. What's your GPU?
2014-10-30 15:12:06	Nothing_Much	Geforce 750 Ti
2014-10-30 15:12:11	Nothing_Much	430W PSU

2014-10-30 15:14:28	Raven67854	Nothing_Much, I really think it's just something up with your system's config files

2014-10-30 15:15:04	jaycee_	tbh if youre not sure if your gpu is faulty, install windows and push it with something like 3dmark.
2014-10-30 15:15:13	jaycee_	i do that with macs too
2014-10-30 15:15:20	disharmonic	Maybe try backing up your x.org config and making a fresh one
2014-10-30 15:15:23	jaycee_	nothing else is really capable of pushing a gpu to its limits
2014-10-30 15:15:37	Raven67854	disharmonic, he should of done that anyway during the Nvidia install process
2014-10-30 15:16:22	disharmonic	jaycee_: furmark is :p (well sort of)
2014-10-30 15:16:38	Raven67854	mmm card burner
2014-10-30 15:16:45	jaycee_	yeah i use furmark as well, didnt realise it was cross platform though
2014-10-30 15:17:08	jaycee_	heh, didnt realise it was opengl in fact. thing is, only the windows drivers tend to push the hardware to its limit
2014-10-30 15:17:13	jaycee_	os x ones certainly dont
2014-10-30 15:17:31	jaycee_	hm i'll have to try furmark out under linux then, that could be interesting
2014-10-30 15:18:16	jaycee_	tbh the only drivers ive had major shit with under linux so far, is fglrx

2014-10-30 15:22:39	flesk__	Sam & Max Hit the Road is great.
2014-10-30 15:22:56	DrMcCoy	stqn: dpkg -x

2014-10-30 15:23:19	stqn	sure, but since I probably won’t play it anyway… it’s just a good reason not to buy it
2014-10-30 15:23:40	jaycee_	packaging stuff in distro-specific formats is just bad news
2014-10-30 15:23:46	stqn	they don’t want non-debian users to get it, no problem for me
2014-10-30 15:24:07	flesk__	stqn: I thought you'd already bought it.
2014-10-30 15:24:21	stqn	oh no. Was just browsing gog…
2014-10-30 15:24:27	DrMcCoy	stqn: Or just by the actual CD on ebay; plays with ScummVM
2014-10-30 15:24:30	DrMcCoy	buy*
2014-10-30 15:25:40	flesk__	Much more expensive though.
2014-10-30 15:25:41	stqn	jaycee_: agreed.
2014-10-30 15:26:11	stqn	a simple .tgz that includes the required libs and a script to launch the game, done, works (almost) everywhere.
2014-10-30 15:27:07	stqn	(ok I haven’t tried all distros and hardware myself… but AFAIU that *should* work :P)
2014-10-30 15:27:09	flesk__	No, wait. I thought the price was listed in USD but it turns out it was NOK. So buying physical copies of Hit the Road might be cheaper if you exclude shipping.
2014-10-30 15:27:34	von	for some reason I thought Warlock 2 would be prettier =/
2014-10-30 15:27:35	DrMcCoy	it's not like dpkg -x is so much more work than tar xzf
2014-10-30 15:27:51	flesk__	It's one additional step.
2014-10-30 15:28:02	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, yes but you have to install dpkg or whatever the package manager is first
2014-10-30 15:28:10	jaycee_	whereas you can guarantee the user has tar :)
2014-10-30 15:28:13	sobkas	doesn't alien translate into tar.gz?
2014-10-30 15:28:34	von	actually I don't mind deb packages
2014-10-30 15:28:48	von	they keep metadata and actual files separately
2014-10-30 15:29:04	DrMcCoy	also, weren't debs just tars?
2014-10-30 15:29:05	von	as long as it's a dumb static installation somewhere in opt without hardcoded absolute paths, it should be ok
2014-10-30 15:29:11	von	DrMcCoy, not exactly
2014-10-30 15:29:12	sobkas	and you can extract them with ar
2014-10-30 15:29:16	von	they are ars
2014-10-30 15:29:21	DrMcCoy	ah
2014-10-30 15:29:25	von	with data and control archives within
2014-10-30 15:29:56	von	data contains actual files, control - install / uninstall scripts
2014-10-30 15:30:07	von	and I think metadata file is just a plaintext file within ar itself
2014-10-30 15:30:08	sobkas	ar x some.deb
2014-10-30 15:30:19	jaycee_	if some controlled install/uninstall process is required, thats what the likes of mojosetup are for imo
2014-10-30 15:30:28	von	and then tar x data.*
2014-10-30 15:30:28	sobkas	and oyster is your uncle
2014-10-30 15:30:31	von	*xf
2014-10-30 15:30:59	von	they are bombs though
2014-10-30 15:31:09	von	so be aware and create a directory to extract them into
2014-10-30 15:31:39	jaycee_	package managers are a good example of linux distro's reinventing the wheel unneccesarily instead of standardising, shrug
2014-10-30 15:32:01	von	it's not a hard wheel to reinvent
2014-10-30 15:32:38	von	turning linux into homogeneous monolithic structure like osx won't do it any good
2014-10-30 15:32:48	von	and won't work anyway since forks exist and the sources are open

2014-10-30 15:36:19	jaycee_	the fact that they got rid of X11 early on was a good choice

2014-10-30 15:36:41	sobkas	jaycee_: no one use it
2014-10-30 15:36:58	von	stqn, Apple disapprove customization
2014-10-30 15:36:59	Nothing_Much	unity disables itself in ccsm when a new GPU is installed or something idk
2014-10-30 15:37:29	jaycee_	stqn, funny you say that when i've seen about 10 clones of the Apple dock for linux ;)
2014-10-30 15:37:46	von	well, they are obviously not created by him
2014-10-30 15:37:54	von	so I don't see how it's relevant
2014-10-30 15:37:59	jaycee_	the dock isnt a bad idea really
2014-10-30 15:38:06	von	I like its concept
2014-10-30 15:38:08	stqn	jaycee_: yeah, I find the zoom thing makes it very hard to click on the correct icon for once :). And then switching between opened windows is a pain.
2014-10-30 15:38:12	sobkas	jaycee_: dock is from cde?
2014-10-30 15:38:14	von	much better than system tray
2014-10-30 15:38:15	jaycee_	its simpler than a start menu and more intuitive for non computer users
2014-10-30 15:38:23	von	and task bar
2014-10-30 15:38:31	jaycee_	stqn, so turn off the zoom
2014-10-30 15:38:40	von	I don't give a single fuck about intuitiveness for non computer users

2014-10-30 16:38:37	stqn	Funny, plenty of linux games on sale on Steam, but they are not showing up in the GOL sales. But on the other hand, Transistor at -50% is on GOL but not listed in the sales on Steam.
2014-10-30 16:39:25	von	I think Transistor is not part of Halloween sale, but rather a sale to celebrate the release of Mac and Linux versions

2014-10-30 17:04:42	stqn	I did the tutorial a few months ago, stopped there (actually I’m not sure if I managed to finish the tutorial.)
2014-10-30 17:05:38	jaycee_	i might put a profanity filter in our new crash reporting system, if you swear at us your crash report just gets discarded
2014-10-30 17:06:25	DrMcCoy	clbuttic mistake
2014-10-30 17:09:06	stqn	jaycee_: are you getting the call stack with the local variables values?
2014-10-30 17:09:23	jaycee_	well, we use google breakpad
2014-10-30 17:09:43	jaycee_	the guy who did the first system oddly decided to symbolise the minidumps on the user's machine for some reason
2014-10-30 17:09:54	jaycee_	the new system im working on sends the minidump to us instead
2014-10-30 17:10:57	jaycee_	"you dumb fucks tried to initialize directx9 on fucking linux". lol
2014-10-30 17:11:14	stqn	ahah :)
2014-10-30 17:11:39	jaycee_	and oh look, the dumb fuck is using a really old mesa gallium, despite us clearly stating it's not supported :)
2014-10-30 17:12:14	jaycee_	which has no S3TC support, so the game's caps check fails.. hence "Failed to initialise DirectX9" :)
2014-10-30 17:12:32	stqn	ah well… I can understand people wanting to run the game on their usual setup. But he could be more … polite.
2014-10-30 17:13:10	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: pah, you should just decompress s3tc manually then!
2014-10-30 17:13:19	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, no, the driver should be capable
2014-10-30 17:13:46	jaycee_	because decompressing the textures would use more vram, probably killing performance
2014-10-30 17:14:08	jaycee_	thats one thing that sucks with gl too, you cant control where textures and stuff goe
2014-10-30 17:14:31	jaycee_	whereas direct3d lets you say specifically vram, system ram, or dont care
2014-10-30 17:17:35	jaycee_	to be honest i expected linux would be a platform where a lot of people would try to do some diagnostics of their own, look at driver settings, try updating things. instead it seems a lot of people just prefer to submit reports with abuse like "fix your fucking wrapper" or "do a native port"
2014-10-30 17:17:59	jaycee_	i see Dead Island has a few of the same problems we did, but they arent getting slagged off like we did
2014-10-30 17:18:44	nykac-	jaycee_: well, not all users are kind
2014-10-30 17:18:56	DrMcCoy	maybe you should take that to heart and do a fucking proper native port?
2014-10-30 17:18:57	nykac-	jaycee_: I usually include backtraces and coredumps
2014-10-30 17:19:02	DrMcCoy	have you thought about that?
2014-10-30 17:19:17	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, that is not what we were contracted for, end of discussion
2014-10-30 17:19:30	jaycee_	linux people who stamp and shout "native or nothing" will get.. nothing
2014-10-30 17:19:52	DrMcCoy	I already told you that I would have rather had nothing
2014-10-30 17:20:01	nykac-	junktext: if its a d3d wrapper, I'm fine with that
2014-10-30 17:20:03	nykac-	er
2014-10-30 17:20:06	nykac-	jaycee_:
2014-10-30 17:20:24	nykac-	I just don't want people using wine as their wrappers and calling it a linux gam
2014-10-30 17:20:28	nykac-	e
2014-10-30 17:20:47	DrMcCoy	Hell, I would have even been more satisfied with you improving wine and building on that
2014-10-30 17:21:05	nykac-	DrMcCoy: why
2014-10-30 17:21:22	DrMcCoy	nykac-: As opposed to this Frankenstein's monster eon thing
2014-10-30 17:21:23	jaycee_	as ive said a million times, what we're doing with eON and what WINE does are different things
2014-10-30 17:21:32	DrMcCoy	Yes
2014-10-30 17:21:33	DrMcCoy	Worse
2014-10-30 17:21:38	jaycee_	rubbish
2014-10-30 17:21:38	nykac-	jaycee_: I've come to understand that
2014-10-30 17:21:52	nykac-	DrMcCoy: do you not like the source games?
2014-10-30 17:22:00	nykac-	the source engine wraps D3D too
2014-10-30 17:22:11	DrMcCoy	Source is a third approach altogether
2014-10-30 17:22:15	jaycee_	apparently a d3d9 wrapper compiled in is fine, but one that works by binary isnt :P
2014-10-30 17:22:19	DrMcCoy	And I'm not all too happy about that either
2014-10-30 17:22:56	DrMcCoy	And yes, I've looked at Civ5 in IDA. It's also a d3d wrapper of some kind
2014-10-30 17:23:15	DrMcCoy	It's...eeeh
2014-10-30 17:24:20	DrMcCoy	But at least I can open Civ5 in IDA
2014-10-30 17:24:35	DrMcCoy	That eon wrapped EXE... IDA doesn't like that too much
2014-10-30 17:24:44	jaycee_	its because IDA doesnt like the EON_RESERVE segment
2014-10-30 17:24:53	jaycee_	doesnt like it in mach-o format either
2014-10-30 17:25:06	jaycee_	tbh, thats a bug in ida as far as im concerned, its just a bss segment
2014-10-30 17:27:10	nykac-	DrMcCoy: did you try radare2?
2014-10-30 17:28:32	DrMcCoy	Nope, I didn't actually poke The Witcher 2 that much
2014-10-30 17:28:42	jaycee_	amusing that some of the most colourful messages are from people not only using crappy mesa like nouveau, but using really old versions of it too
2014-10-30 17:28:51	jaycee_	despite the specs explicitly saying that it isnt supported
2014-10-30 17:29:20	nykac-	jaycee_: perhaps push an update that gives an error like 'mesa to old'
2014-10-30 17:29:25	DrMcCoy	Well, the rationale is probably that it doesn't hurt to try
2014-10-30 17:29:30	jaycee_	then we'de get moaned at for blocking mesa
2014-10-30 17:29:36	DrMcCoy	And then they see an error message that's something weird
2014-10-30 17:29:41	nykac-	jaycee_: perhaps a warning then
2014-10-30 17:29:46	DrMcCoy	Like "Can't intialize D3D9"
2014-10-30 17:29:53	jaycee_	then we'd get moaned at for "not supporting open source drivers"
2014-10-30 17:30:47	nykac-	jaycee_: heh aspyr
2014-10-30 17:30:48	jaycee_	and if i had a pound for every time ive heard "but half life 2 runs"
2014-10-30 17:30:56	nykac-	BL2 runs great on mesa
2014-10-30 17:31:14	nykac-	but they don't support you
2014-10-30 17:31:31	jaycee_	Source is a pretty old engine now in comparison to REDengine
2014-10-30 17:31:35	nykac-	yeah
2014-10-30 17:31:55	jaycee_	it also falls back a lot if a particular feature isnt supported
2014-10-30 17:32:16	DrMcCoy	Which is a good thing to do
2014-10-30 17:32:40	DrMcCoy	Like, for example, the manual deS3TC
2014-10-30 17:33:04	jaycee_	no, mesa should just support it. it does but you have to install some seperate library for some reason
2014-10-30 17:33:09	jaycee_	no idea why
2014-10-30 17:33:13	DrMcCoy	Patents.
2014-10-30 17:33:30	jaycee_	tough shit tbh
2014-10-30 17:33:41	jaycee_	compressed texture formats are so widely used
2014-10-30 17:33:47	jaycee_	support them, or dont expect stuff to work
2014-10-30 17:34:13	jaycee_	when youre talking about compression ratios of 4:1 or as high as 6:1, you cannot reasonably expect "just decompress them" to work
2014-10-30 17:34:22	nykac-	https://i.imgur.com/8n3eXBR.jpg
2014-10-30 17:34:24	DrMcCoy	Well, I just pulled in a manually decompressor: https://github.com/xoreos/xoreos/blob/master/src/graphics/images/s3tc.cpp

2014-10-30 17:34:30	jaycee_	besides, if patents are an issue, what makes you think we can include S3TC code in our game
2014-10-30 17:34:30	DrMcCoy	Bam, no problem
2014-10-30 17:34:47	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Because you should ignore those patents
2014-10-30 17:34:54	nykac-	DrMcCoy: dude
2014-10-30 17:34:56	jaycee_	right, and we should get sued ?
2014-10-30 17:35:11	nykac-	DrMcCoy: mesa libs can get away with it becasue its external library, and the user enables it
2014-10-30 17:35:16	jaycee_	an open source project is not going to get sued
2014-10-30 17:35:20	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Well, in which jurisdiction are you?
2014-10-30 17:35:21	jaycee_	a company is
2014-10-30 17:35:24	nykac-	jaycee_: they can be
2014-10-30 17:35:31	jaycee_	nykac-, yeah but its far less likely
2014-10-30 17:35:32	nykac-	jaycee_: its more the fact the the user clicks enable
2014-10-30 17:35:49	nykac-	jaycee_: and mesa's legal defence can be, that the user stated that they have a license by clicking enable
2014-10-30 17:36:10	jaycee_	incidentally i dont see why it requires a seperate library anyway
2014-10-30 17:36:17	jaycee_	the decompression should be in the hardware
2014-10-30 17:36:30	nykac-	jaycee_: yeah, I was wondering about that too
2014-10-30 17:36:37	jaycee_	thats the whole point, the textures are stored in VRAM compressed, and decompressde by the GPU in real time
2014-10-30 17:36:51	jaycee_	if MESA is just uncompressing them in software, well then they suck
2014-10-30 17:37:07	turol	the gl spec also says they must support compression on the fly
2014-10-30 17:37:32	turol	so they need the compression code
2014-10-30 17:37:57	Sik	<jaycee_> besides, if patents are an issue, what makes you think we can include S3TC code in our game ← Taking a guess, the patents are only for whatever has to decode them
2014-10-30 17:38:07	Sik	The game doesn't have to, the drivers or GPU does

2014-10-30 17:38:24	jaycee_	id say its the hardware that does
2014-10-30 17:38:45	jaycee_	so code in MESA would not be covered by patent as such, it would just upload the compressed texture and tell the hardware what format it is
2014-10-30 17:38:48	Sik	That said, aren't the DXT* formats S3TC or am I mixing up with something else?
2014-10-30 17:38:56	jaycee_	sik, they are based on it yes
2014-10-30 17:39:05	Sik	Because Microsoft happily explains the format like nothing is amiss
2014-10-30 17:39:13	Sik	If there were patents you'd think they'd want to keep it secret

2014-10-30 17:39:38	Sik	*sigh*
2014-10-30 17:39:45	Sik	In before telling me now to go study patent law
2014-10-30 17:39:52	jaycee_	the point is, decompression is in the hardware
2014-10-30 17:40:08	jaycee_	so it is nvidia and amd that have to pay for it
2014-10-30 17:40:12	jaycee_	mesa does not
2014-10-30 17:40:41	jaycee_	my guess is what this really is is the typical opensource hippy "patents are evil" rubbish, and mesa would rather cut its nose off to spite its face, than have proper support for s3tc
2014-10-30 17:40:53	turol	but full implementation of the spec requires software comp/decomp too
2014-10-30 17:40:56	turol	so mesa might get sued
2014-10-30 17:41:09	Sik	Erm
2014-10-30 17:41:13	Sik	Isn't texture compression optional?
2014-10-30 17:41:14	DrMcCoy	No, there is force_s3tc_enable which just hands it off to the graphics hardware
2014-10-30 17:41:31	jaycee_	it should be dealt with by the hardware anyway
2014-10-30 17:41:42	DrMcCoy	But you need companion code in the drivers
2014-10-30 17:41:47	jaycee_	youd have to go to really really old hardware to find a gpu that doesnt handle s3tc in hardware
2014-10-30 17:41:57	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, not that implements the algorithm
2014-10-30 17:42:52	jaycee_	anyway, its up to drivers on linux to improve... not for us to work around their bugs and lack of features

2014-10-30 17:45:20	Sik	Well, in part Linux itself too, it's stupid I can't update the driver because it'll break the system due to the dual GPU setup (can't Linux just ignore the second GPU if it doesn't have the means to handle it?)
2014-10-30 17:45:21	nykac-	jaycee_: perhaps help mesa improve?

2014-10-30 17:46:04	Sik	nykac-: if I ever attempt to change the driver, damn thing will try to use the second GPU instead of the first one, rendering X unusable
2014-10-30 17:46:05	nykac-	Sik: in the kernel you can disable it by poking the procfs
2014-10-30 17:46:08	jaycee_	nykac-, knowing how to write 3d code, and knowing how to write drivers are two totally different things
2014-10-30 17:46:46	jaycee_	its been said that Valve have helped improve mesa, i suspect theres only two or three employees there that have done so

2014-10-30 17:50:53	nykac	Sik: and you don't need a full xorg.conf anyways
2014-10-30 17:51:09	Sik	Basically there wasn't any way to get it working after that
2014-10-30 17:51:14	nykac	Sik: you just need to drop something in xorg.d
2014-10-30 17:51:15	Sik	Had to reinstall the OS
2014-10-30 17:51:18	nykac	Sik: ouch
2014-10-30 17:51:28	Sik	Well, it was a practically fresh install anyway
2014-10-30 17:51:35	nykac	Sik: I've started taking snapshots before doing dangerous updates
2014-10-30 17:51:49	jaycee_	well no what you probably needed to do was completely remove fglrx and rebuild your initrd
2014-10-30 17:52:00	jaycee_	but fglrx is a fucking pain for getting into that state
2014-10-30 17:52:02	Sik	Well as I said it was practically fresh, I had just gotten the computer and I had barely just installed some programs
2014-10-30 17:52:18	Sik	Not like it mattered much since reinstalling left the files intact, but eh
2014-10-30 17:53:14	Sik	But yeah next time I'll first try to get an installer ready before updating anything, just in case stuff breaks again
2014-10-30 17:53:26	Sik	(first will see if I can wake up the second GPU so the problem can't happen in the first place)
2014-10-30 17:53:37	Sik	But I need to get a new pendrive first >_>
2014-10-30 17:54:03	jaycee_	sadly its not something i see improving on linux because the people who could improve how it works, wont improve it, as in their minds theres nothing wrong
2014-10-30 17:54:06	nykac	Sik: also use btrfs and make a snopshot first
2014-10-30 17:54:12	nykac	*snapshot
2014-10-30 17:54:13	jaycee_	and "only proprietary drivers have a problem, they should just become open source"
2014-10-30 17:54:16	nykac	tehn you can just roll back
2014-10-30 17:56:36	jaycee_	even windows sensibly handles graphics driver fail now
2014-10-30 17:56:55	jaycee_	admittedly it used to be really shite at it, and of course if you cant get graphics you cant do anything
2014-10-30 17:57:33	jaycee_	but now it pretty much reliably falls back to SVGA if anything goes wrong, and can change driver on the fly as well
2014-10-30 17:58:14	Sik	Oh yeah that reminds me
2014-10-30 17:58:23	Sik	For some reason VESA mode wasn't working here
2014-10-30 17:58:39	Sik	Like, it'd show me an error message box then not let me continue in X
2014-10-30 17:58:44	jaycee_	yep
2014-10-30 17:58:48	jaycee_	happens here too
2014-10-30 17:58:55	Sik	If it was working I'd have just tried to undo the change there to see if it worked
2014-10-30 17:58:57	jaycee_	fallback mode just doesnt work
2014-10-30 17:59:04	Sik	Kind of annoying since in my previous computer it worked just fine
2014-10-30 17:59:20	Sik	Unless some new computers have broken VESA implementations...
2014-10-30 17:59:29	jaycee_	no its just x11
2014-10-30 17:59:44	jaycee_	and noone wants to fix it because "what? you can fix it from a tty..."
2014-10-30 17:59:50	Sik	Well if the VESA firmware is buggy or does something unusual and X doesn't know about it then it'll break
2014-10-30 18:00:28	jaycee_	well, windows manages it
2014-10-30 18:00:29	Sik	It wouldn't be the first time firmware doesn't respect the spec (all major OSes have tons of hacks around them)
2014-10-30 18:01:17	Sik	And yeah that's another issue, in many cases they just test if the firmware works with whatever versions of Windows they care about, and if it does then it ships, no matter if something else is broken
2014-10-30 18:01:39	Sik	Then again
2014-10-30 18:01:48	jaycee_	well surely if windows safe mode works, enough is usable, and it's not hard to figure out
2014-10-30 18:01:49	Sik	X in VESA mode *did* boot the graphics mode properly after all
2014-10-30 18:02:05	Sik	It would just keep popping up the message box after I tell it to let me alone
2014-10-30 18:02:05	jaycee_	what makes me laugh as well is that UEFI would solve this quite directly with its GOP mode
2014-10-30 18:02:11	jaycee_	but Linux people are against UEFI...
2014-10-30 18:02:21	Sik	No, just the secure boot part

2014-10-30 18:02:39	Sik	Being against the other parts of UEFI would be stupid
2014-10-30 18:02:54	jaycee_	nope ive seen plenty of racket about how UEFI is stupid etc etc and we should stick with bios
2014-10-30 18:02:57	jaycee_	or of course, coreboot
2014-10-30 18:03:07	Sik	(and the problem with secure boot being that you can be screwed if you can't disable it or use your own keys)
2014-10-30 18:03:09	jaycee_	secure boot is fine as long as it can always be disabled
2014-10-30 18:03:18	Sik	Oh fuck BIOS
2014-10-30 18:03:31	Sik	The only reliably working part of it left is the one telling you about the memory mapping
2014-10-30 18:03:40	jaycee_	my machines are Gigabyte boards with UEFI, and they have secure boot, and it can be disabled just fine
2014-10-30 18:03:46	Sik	And only because the OS can't figure it out by itself
2014-10-30 18:04:00	Sik	jaycee_: yeah, that's fine then
2014-10-30 18:04:14	Sik	It's just people being overly cautious before somebody even tries
2014-10-30 18:04:20	jaycee_	it also makes me laugh how some linux fanatics are saying UEFI is Microsoft trying to kill off Linux.. when er... EFI is an INTEL thing...
2014-10-30 18:04:35	Sik	Apple uses UEFI...
2014-10-30 18:04:50	jaycee_	well no, they use EFI, slightly older
2014-10-30 18:04:54	Sik	Oh
2014-10-30 18:05:02	jaycee_	but a lot of the same concepts
2014-10-30 18:05:08	Sik	I thought they switched to UEFI already
2014-10-30 18:06:05	jaycee_	EFI was developed by Intel, and UEFI is i think built upon it by several companies

2014-10-30 18:15:28	nykac	Sik: on some machines the switched to UEFI
2014-10-30 18:15:38	Sik	OK
2014-10-30 18:16:13	nykac	jaycee_: another thing is that kernel devs weren't happy about UEFI signing mandating PE
2014-10-30 18:16:36	jaycee_	who cares, its a documented format, easy enough to produce
2014-10-30 18:16:45	nykac	jaycee_: ...
2014-10-30 18:16:53	nykac	jaycee_: its like asking people to use mach-o
2014-10-30 18:17:01	jaycee_	who cares if they did, gotta pick a format
2014-10-30 18:17:04	jaycee_	why should it be ELF?
2014-10-30 18:17:14	jaycee_	"because Linux" ? rubbish...
2014-10-30 18:17:15	nykac	jaycee_: because ELF is used by many
2014-10-30 18:17:21	jaycee_	no, ELF is used by Linux
2014-10-30 18:17:25	nykac	jaycee_: *BSD, Solaris/Illuminos
2014-10-30 18:17:48	jaycee_	BSD and solaris used to use something else, until Linux centricity pretty much forced it to ELF
2014-10-30 18:17:52	nykac	jaycee_: a.out
2014-10-30 18:18:01	nykac	jaycee_: elf has some advantages over a.out
2014-10-30 18:18:05	jaycee_	and who cares anyway, only the loader part has to be PE
2014-10-30 18:18:10	nykac	jaycee_: linux itself used to be a.out
2014-10-30 18:18:22	nykac	jaycee_: and the kernel modules too
2014-10-30 18:18:34	nykac	jaycee_: UEFI spec makes it so to be  compliant you have to sign modules/drivers
2014-10-30 18:18:35	jaycee_	nope, nothing to stop you just writing the loader part in PE
2014-10-30 18:18:48	jaycee_	right, well linux isnt going to agree to signing anything anyway
2014-10-30 18:19:06	nykac	jaycee_: well, its up to the distro or user to sign their modules
2014-10-30 18:19:08	jaycee_	linux already makes an initrd image
2014-10-30 18:19:22	jaycee_	so why cant it make a PE image containing kernel + initrd which then gets signed
2014-10-30 18:19:42	jaycee_	it can, Linux just doesnt want to, theyd rather bitch
2014-10-30 18:20:04	jaycee_	and well i'd say ELF has more potential issues than PE does. MS havent put any license or patents on PE
2014-10-30 18:20:06	nykac	jaycee_: they already sorta hack PE into ELF for the EFI stub
2014-10-30 18:20:12	jaycee_	ELF is under GPL, probably V3 now
2014-10-30 18:20:22	jaycee_	and GPL is a license that doesnt play well commercially
2014-10-30 18:20:38	nykac	jaycee_: I'm pretty sure ELF isn't GPL, perhaps an implementation may be
2014-10-30 18:20:41	jaycee_	GPL V3 is specifically designed to be an obstacle to commercial use
2014-10-30 18:22:12	jaycee_	and apparently no it's not PE, it's COFF
2014-10-30 18:22:24	nykac	oh yeah

2014-10-30 18:22:56	jaycee_	right, well linux people slagging off MS for COFF.. guess what... COFF is not an MS invention, it's AT&T :)
2014-10-30 18:24:09	jaycee_	so the real reason is Linux people threw a paddy because thier stuff wasnt chosen
2014-10-30 18:24:15	nykac	jaycee_: also ELF comes from SystemV
2014-10-30 18:24:28	nykac	"ELF first appeared in Solaris 2.0"
2014-10-30 18:24:32	nykac	from osdev
2014-10-30 18:24:56	jaycee_	elf is also a fucking complicated format
2014-10-30 18:25:17	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: really, the more you talk, the more I get the clue that you are a total Gumby
2014-10-30 18:25:28	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, i just dont worship Linux
2014-10-30 18:25:45	DrMcCoy	It goes beyond that, way beyond
2014-10-30 18:25:46	jaycee_	its an interesting platform, but a lot of the people on it piss me off
2014-10-30 18:26:01	jaycee_	the attitudes of a lot of linux users and developers majorly pisses me off
2014-10-30 18:26:28	Sik	<jaycee_> ELF is under GPL, probably V3 now ← Formats don't have licenses o_o
2014-10-30 18:26:31	nykac	jaycee_: perhaps the could have pulled a multiboot and not specified a format, just a header to be included
2014-10-30 18:26:48	Sik	Algorithms can, but file formats definitely not
2014-10-30 18:26:51	jaycee_	nykac, thats just problematic then, its more code to maintain
2014-10-30 18:26:52	nykac	jaycee_: neither do I, I like most unices and unix-like operating systems
2014-10-30 18:27:45	Sik	How complex is PE, btw? (or at least what UEFI needs from PE)
2014-10-30 18:28:19	jaycee_	not as complex as ELF is
2014-10-30 18:28:21	Sik	AFAIK it isn't much different than ELF in that sense, but just to make sure

2014-10-30 18:29:00	jaycee_	and anyway like i said, who cares - they picked a format, and the only reason linux is pissing and moaning, is because it wasnt ELF

2014-10-31 14:25:30	mirv_	gates has done a lot of good things with his money
2014-10-31 14:27:14	Happy-Ferret	Was that before or after he ruined a whole generation with his advocacy of Common Core and crippled children in India?
2014-10-31 14:28:20	mirv_	a) what's common core? and b) pretty sure he didn't cripple children in india
2014-10-31 14:28:32	disharmonic	Honestly it's impossible to discern the motivations behind where billionaires spend their money. But Gates has indeed spent quite a bit of money on worth wile causes
2014-10-31 14:28:41	mirv_	I may not like microsoft, but gates has never been evil
2014-10-31 14:28:46	@Samsai	yup, it was ballmer who crippled children

2014-10-31 14:31:06	Happy-Ferret	Bill Gates did, in fact, cripple children. The irresponsible behaviour of the Gates Foundation caused the paralysis of almost 50,000 Indian children. Instead of receiving the same polio vaccine western children would receive, the Gates foundation administered old, expired live-virus vaccines.
2014-10-31 14:31:48	@Samsai	ouch
2014-10-31 14:32:03	Happy-Ferret	As for Common Core. An image can say more than a thousand words.

2014-10-31 14:35:41	mirv_	actually, that particular example isn't about the math per-se...
2014-10-31 14:36:00	mirv_	it's about a simple sanity self-check

2014-10-31 14:37:50	@Samsai	wait wait wait... is this stuff that has received an official stamp of approval from someone?
2014-10-31 14:37:51	Happy-Ferret	Common Core isn't about math, at all. It's merely about insanely stupid people getting their way and dragging down the rest of us. One of the Common Core architects even said that it was ok if a kid thought 2+2 equaled 5, as long as that kid could explain how he got there.
2014-10-31 14:38:03	mirv_	how...accurate is that polio thing?
2014-10-31 14:38:14	DrMcCoy	No, sorry, as much as I hate Microsoft and Bill Gates and the Foundation doing shady patents deals, that Common Core criticism is bullshit

2014-10-31 14:38:26	mirv_	I'm reading conflicting statements that it wasn't actually the vaccine causing anything
2014-10-31 14:39:04	Happy-Ferret	Samsai, indeed it has. Houghton Mifflin was contracted to print those books.
2014-10-31 14:39:48	@Samsai	but... that sticker exercise isn't even possible...
2014-10-31 14:40:36	@Samsai	i'm utterly confused
2014-10-31 14:40:42	Happy-Ferret	DrMyCoy, No offense. But you grew up in a country that always had kind of a Common Core to its whole curriculum. Germany is pretty much the poster child for American education today.
2014-10-31 14:41:46	Happy-Ferret	Samsai, there isn't a sane answer to that. But hey, thanks to Common Core there doesn't need to be one. As long as you can explain how you got there, every answer is a correct answer. Magic!
2014-10-31 14:41:52	DrMcCoy	I thought the poster child of American Education is what Texas is doing with putting creationism into biology books?
2014-10-31 14:42:40	@Samsai	but... but...
2014-10-31 14:43:50	Happy-Ferret	I think it's safe to say that Juanita doesn't have any friends. Therefore the correct answer is "She should keep all her stickers" ^^
2014-10-31 14:45:09	@Samsai	so, this common core thing taughts children that doing this correctly doesn't matter as long as you can explain your unreasoning in some illogical way?
2014-10-31 14:45:42	@Samsai	i think my english is breaking up from this horrible abuse of mathematics
2014-10-31 14:47:17	Happy-Ferret	Essentially, yes. Teachers might still explain the correct answer to them but the wrong answer and a well formulated reasoning gets rewarded with more points than simply putting down the correct answer without a written explanation.
2014-10-31 14:47:22	mirv_	there could be missing text that explains it more clearly
2014-10-31 14:48:02	@Samsai	i understand the need for explanation, explaining your reasoning is a major part in math
2014-10-31 14:48:03	Happy-Ferret	mirv_, there isn't. There are half a dozen scans of that particular page online. There is no other text.
2014-10-31 14:48:20	@Samsai	but if you reasoning is just plain wrong then you shouldn't get rewarded
2014-10-31 14:48:33	mirv_	well, in that case, they should have worded it much better
2014-10-31 14:48:48	DrMcCoy	The interesting thing is that I can't even find a source for that sticker problem that is not a right-wing hate site
2014-10-31 14:49:04	mirv_	I can see what they want to ask though
2014-10-31 14:49:08	DrMcCoy	freerepublic, limbaugh, you name it they have it
2014-10-31 14:49:35	Happy-Ferret	It's still BS. If some prodigy kid can come up with the solutions to all math problems, he/she shouldn't be punished for not providing a long winding reasoning.
2014-10-31 14:49:35	Raven67854	Samsai, common core isn't in USA education "yet" or it might be. I am glad I'm done before hand
2014-10-31 14:49:45	mirv_	they want to teach how to approach a problem, not just the solution to a problem
2014-10-31 14:49:52	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, Dunno why you would say something so silly as creationism being shoved into schools in USA
2014-10-31 14:50:23	DrMcCoy	This reminds me of the few people angry here in Germany about sex education changes
2014-10-31 14:50:29	DrMcCoy	Pulling quotes out of context
2014-10-31 14:51:21	Happy-Ferret	 DrMcCoy, there is nothing to be pulled out of context
2014-10-31 14:51:41	DrMcCoy	Suddenly, a lesson that teaches that, yes, ingesting sperm is a vector for HIV transmission for 15+ pupils gets transformed into 8 year old kids getting taught about spitting vs. swallow
2014-10-31 14:51:45	mirv_	if I haven't read the whole test, there's no context
2014-10-31 14:51:49	mirv_	so DrMcCoy has a point here
2014-10-31 14:52:31	Happy-Ferret	calwatchdog.com and Natural News are probably too "right wing" for you either, eh?
2014-10-31 14:52:51	DrMcCoy	Well, Natural News is a quack site
2014-10-31 14:53:16	DrMcCoy	dunno calwatchdog

2014-10-31 14:57:22	Happy-Ferret	If only I knew ... Basic math has served humanity rather well throughout the history. "New Math" might be the worst invention since "New Coke".
2014-10-31 14:58:35	DrMcCoy	Oh, yes, because clearly there is no problem with how maths was tought in the past. That's why every child ever says that maths is their favourite subject
2014-10-31 14:59:49	DrMcCoy	This is a very real problem: Kids are not taught to thing, to apply general laws and rules. Instead, they are taught to replicate exact one answer
2014-10-31 15:00:07	Raven67854	But math is important though. I mean really knowing math
2014-10-31 15:00:18	DrMcCoy	Yes
2014-10-31 15:00:46	DrMcCoy	Not just maths as in "Oh, I can add and substract these numbers", but the logic behind the system
2014-10-31 15:01:07	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, there is a problem with that. I grant you that. But the problem is that, in the past, math lessons were already too far removed from reality.
2014-10-31 15:01:53	Happy-Ferret	Rather than teaching kids how to juggle with completely irrelevant stats and numbers, perhaps they should start teaching them to think in real, economically applicable values.
2014-10-31 15:02:20	DerRidda	In Physics for example it IS more important how you got your result, that's where all the understanding is, just hammering down a numeric value nets you 0 points.
2014-10-31 15:02:53	@Samsai	it's also important to know how you get to the result correctly
2014-10-31 15:03:48	mirv_	answer is 12 stickers
2014-10-31 15:04:07	@Samsai	i'm not sure how math is taught in your countries, but it seemed quite logical to me and we were never asked to replicate answers
2014-10-31 15:04:17	mirv_	at least a minimum
2014-10-31 15:04:47	mirv_	that was some bad english
2014-10-31 15:04:57	Raven67854	mirv_, haha
2014-10-31 15:06:43	Happy-Ferret	DerRidda, great. In that case, I'll say the earth is flat and dragged around by a giant turtle. How I got there? Easy enough. The curvature of the earth's horizon matches the shape of a turtle's shell. 3 out of 6 points for me. ;)
2014-10-31 15:07:04	DerRidda	Nope, still zero.
2014-10-31 15:07:05	Raven67854	Discworld is awesome
2014-10-31 15:07:22	Happy-Ferret	DerRidda, but... but... wasn't that a proper explanation?
2014-10-31 15:07:42	mirv_	no
2014-10-31 15:07:54	mirv_	you forgot to include the actual curvature values
2014-10-31 15:07:58	DrMcCoy	They're obviously going for the lcm(4, 6)
2014-10-31 15:07:59	mirv_	and species of turtle
2014-10-31 15:08:00	Happy-Ferret	Damn!

2014-10-31 15:08:56	DrMcCoy	Especially with the questions before that, with kids counting in 8s and 5s, it makes a lot of sense
2014-10-31 15:09:09	DrMcCoy	Oh, yes, Fox.
2014-10-31 15:09:26	DrMcCoy	Got a Daily Mail article too?

2014-10-31 15:23:00	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Is MSNBC as far left as http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2014/42/50732.html ? as https://de.indymedia.org/node/1792 ?

2014-10-31 15:23:30	Raven67854	DerRidda, If he was an American he would know to ignore Europeans at this point.
2014-10-31 15:24:47	mirv_	I can sense this going into Europe vs USA territory
2014-10-31 15:24:58	Happy-Ferret	It's insanely silly to think that Americans would live in a sort of bullet proof bubble that no leftist dares entering, is all I'm trying to say.
2014-10-31 15:25:05	Raven67854	mirv_, Nah nobody cares
2014-10-31 15:25:14	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Would MSNBC reporters march in a demonstration against their own state? Similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Germans_%28political_current%29 ?

2014-10-31 15:26:36	Happy-Ferret	Lol. Anti-Germans aren't part of the general left. In fact, most of my conservative friends and colleagues sympathize with them. As do I.
2014-10-31 15:27:06	Happy-Ferret	Nor would the left in Soviet Russia march against it's own government, btw.
2014-10-31 15:27:18	Happy-Ferret	At least not the true "believers"
2014-10-31 15:27:29	@Samsai	because it wasn't allowed

2014-10-31 15:30:42	mirv_	I think that to properly discuss political situations in Europe, one has to live there, and visit some of the countries
2014-10-31 15:31:02	Happy-Ferret	Even though I live in Germany, talking to actual Germans (i. e. DrMcCoy or DerRidda) about politics always ends up being the most mind numbing exercise. It's like you guys never truly recovered from all the brain washing before, during and after WWII.
2014-10-31 15:31:03	Raven67854	mirv_, That would also apply to people talking about USA politics
2014-10-31 15:31:21	mirv_	Raven67854, true, but to a lesser extent because of it being only one country
2014-10-31 15:31:30	Raven67854	mirv_, True but it's complicated here.

2014-10-31 15:32:09	Raven67854	mirv_, You can't because none of them are accurate. It's freaking ridiculous
2014-10-31 15:32:16	Raven67854	It's about viewers and ratings
2014-10-31 15:32:41	Happy-Ferret	If one country should have libertarian tendencies, one would think it had to be Germany. But no, apparently thinking for oneself and criticizing the government is still unpopular with you guys.
2014-10-31 15:33:18	BTRE	Hooray for sweeping generalizations.
2014-10-31 15:33:33	mirv_	yeah....sorry Happy-Ferret, that statement doesn't fit in
2014-10-31 15:33:51	mirv_	so let's all just agree that the current goverment in Australia needs to bugger off
2014-10-31 15:33:54	Happy-Ferret	It ceases to be a generalization when people actually elect others with that exact kind of mindset.

2014-10-31 15:34:33	BTRE	And I'm sure that America is just latte-drinking liberals and Jesus-loving gun freaks.
2014-10-31 15:34:38	mirv_	Raven67854, oh no, couldn't possibly happen!
2014-10-31 15:34:48	Raven67854	BTRE, I own guns

2014-10-31 15:35:15	BTRE	Raven67854, This is my point. Caricatures and generalizations are pointless.
2014-10-31 15:35:19	mirv_	I'm a fan of Lord of the Rings myself
2014-10-31 15:35:41	Raven67854	mirv_, Lord of the Rings universe would be great. We would all have a common enemy
2014-10-31 15:35:45	Raven67854	Regardless of our own differences
2014-10-31 15:36:11	mirv_	yeah, it would simplify a lot of things
2014-10-31 15:36:38	@Samsai	no guns though :P
2014-10-31 15:36:46	DrMcCoy	I rather favour Michael Moorcock's opinion on Tolkien
2014-10-31 15:36:50	Raven67854	Samsai, Bitch I get swords and bows
2014-10-31 15:36:55	Happy-Ferret	Seriously. The government can pack their backs and fuck off, for all I care. I just want to live a happy life without constantly worrying about how to pay my taxes, how to afford petrol, whether it's "moral" to buy foreign goods and whatnot.
2014-10-31 15:36:58	Raven67854	I own 3 bows as well
2014-10-31 15:37:03	mirv_	Samsai, there's magic
2014-10-31 15:37:13	Raven67854	Oh yeah magic to
2014-10-31 15:37:13	@Samsai	mirv_, true
2014-10-31 15:37:21	Raven67854	I love my bows <3
2014-10-31 15:37:30	Raven67854	I should really restring my one and go shoot it again
2014-10-31 15:40:19	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, well you do need a goverment.. I'm like you though. I prefer a goverment with as little interaction with me as possible.
2014-10-31 15:40:30	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Well, I partially agree with you, but probably not in the way you like. I sympathize with anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism
2014-10-31 15:41:29	DrMcCoy	I'm fine with the government fucking off, but I always like capitalism, money and private property to fuck off too
2014-10-31 15:41:36	DrMcCoy	s/always/also/
2014-10-31 15:41:36	GolliumBot	DrMcCoy meant to say: I'm fine with the government fucking off, but I also like capitalism, money and private property to fuck off too
2014-10-31 15:41:38	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, how do I need government? Aside of being forced into a crappy public school, the government has done nothing for me.
2014-10-31 15:42:55	Raven67854	It offers protection. Pure anarchy would eventually just lead to a goverment...
2014-10-31 15:43:20	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, good luck with that. What you're proposing is akin to one giant free for all shoot off.
2014-10-31 15:43:42	@Samsai	anarchy as a whole is just a free for all shoot off
2014-10-31 15:44:08	DrMcCoy	Yes, and I realize that, that's why I currently, at the moment, very much like the idea of a government existing
2014-10-31 15:44:21	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, when I say government, I'm referring to government in the traditional sense. i. e. an inefficient behemoth ruled by illiterate bureaucrats.
2014-10-31 15:45:00	DrMcCoy	Sure, if you randomly redefine words to stuff them with loaded associations...
2014-10-31 15:45:31	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, they were illiterate?
2014-10-31 15:45:40	Happy-Ferret	Much of what the government "provides" can easily be achieved by free enterprise, at 1/8 the cost and 3 times the benefits.
2014-10-31 15:46:00	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, politically, economically and socially illiterate. Yes.
2014-10-31 15:46:01	DrMcCoy	Then I guess I don't like US-Americans either, as in gas-filled meatbags
2014-10-31 15:46:32	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, ??
2014-10-31 15:46:55	DrMcCoy	Oh, yes, are we go, the libertarian utopia of free enterprises solving everything
2014-10-31 15:46:56	@Samsai	this conversation is getting really interesting
2014-10-31 15:47:42	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, communism doesn't work because of corruption. And honestly neither does entirely free market. Sure it works at first. But then you get comcast
2014-10-31 15:47:43	DrMcCoy	Tell us how we're all just moochers suckling on the teat of government handouts
2014-10-31 15:48:18	Raven67854	They both lead to the same thing. You gett fucked and being unable to afford or have anything. It really wouldn't work.
2014-10-31 15:48:34	DrMcCoy	I await the 30 page long monologue
2014-10-31 15:48:49	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, On what?
2014-10-31 15:48:59	Happy-Ferret	Really. Germany is a perfect example of a failed, unjust government.  People providing the least receive the most.
2014-10-31 15:49:03	DrMcCoy	Raven67854: Not from you, from Happy-Galt
2014-10-31 15:49:14	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, oh I know that.. Just on what?
2014-10-31 15:49:21	Happy-Ferret	Even the old left would despise this kind of thinking
2014-10-31 15:49:38	DrMcCoy	Raven67854: Moochers
2014-10-31 15:49:52	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, Well it's not substainable
2014-10-31 15:51:07	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: I agree with you on Germany. Just that I don't think I agree on who it is that is providing the least and what the fault is
2014-10-31 15:51:24	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, It unfortunately is, up to a certain point. By the time people realize just how unsustainable this all is, it has already sent many good people to the poor house.
2014-10-31 15:52:18	Happy-Ferret	You're probably going to blame it all on slightly better off people (preferably in the south west) aren't you, DrMcCoy?
2014-10-31 15:52:35	DrMcCoy	I'm going to blame the corporations not paying their damn taxes
2014-10-31 15:52:49	Happy-Ferret	Hah. Knew it, called it!
2014-10-31 15:53:48	Happy-Ferret	Thing is, the government isn't really doing a good job nurturing new corporations. New corporations, however, are needed to sustain the system.
2014-10-31 15:54:26	DrMcCoy	Sustain the capitalist system that is corrupt and set up to be completely wack from the get go
2014-10-31 15:54:44	Happy-Ferret	The true problem are people not pulling their weight. People like my cousin who just recently decided it was better to waste away on video games than earn a living wage.
2014-10-31 15:55:01	DrMcCoy	Unjust is built into capitalism. It isn't even a bug, it's a damn feature
2014-10-31 15:55:20	DrMcCoy	Oh, yes, right, people not pulling their weight
2014-10-31 15:55:26	DrMcCoy	All the damn moochers
2014-10-31 15:55:33	stqn	politicians are doing what’s best for them. They get paid and lobbied by people with a lot of money, so they also do what’s best for people with a lot of money. Not what’s best for everyone. That’s a problem.
2014-10-31 15:55:37	Happy-Ferret	Where is the bloody Capitalism, then? I can't find it anywhere.
2014-10-31 15:56:16	stqn	Another problem is that money is created by private banks for private banks, instead of being creating by everyone for everyone.
2014-10-31 15:56:48	@Samsai	IMO the whole idea of currency has become twisted
2014-10-31 15:56:55	stqn	The problem is not the people who decide to play video games instead of chasing jobs that don’t exist.
2014-10-31 15:57:04	Raven67854	In my state
2014-10-31 15:57:07	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, seriously dude. That last one was almost a fucking insult. Are you saying I should not be angry about people receiving the same kind of money (for providing nothing) I earn by working 10 hours/day?
2014-10-31 15:57:10	Raven67854	Okay wait
2014-10-31 15:57:18	Raven67854	I should put that on one line my bad
2014-10-31 15:57:46	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: You should rather question why you only earn so damn little for working 10 hours a day. You know, stop kicking down
2014-10-31 15:58:16	Raven67854	In my state the minimium wage is still $7.25/h(Which is fucking ridiculous. It is being raised but not until next year because companies like comcast lobbied hooray!). But if you get on welfare you make about $13/h which is almots double what you would make actually working. So yeah most people just choose welfare because they can actually live that way
2014-10-31 15:58:23	DrMcCoy	And, in fact, I quite like the idea of the basic income
2014-10-31 15:59:35	Raven67854	And of course there's those that do it purely because well they just don't want to work. but honestly those people are the smallest percentage of that
2014-10-31 15:59:48	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Because, really, the unemployment pay is right now, what, 399€ + rent up to a point?
2014-10-31 15:59:52	stqn	DrMcCoy: me too. It has a *lot* of benefits, and if you look at it from the angle of money creation it makes sense to distribute money to everyone (or have everyone create money).
2014-10-31 16:00:02	Happy-Ferret	Kicking down? If anything, I'm kicking up. On the social pyramid, those people are one level above me. They're doing less than the monarchs of old, mindlessly pissing away everyone else's resources.
2014-10-31 16:00:03	Raven67854	I've found a lot of people do want to work. but they don't want work for nothing doing a lot of work
2014-10-31 16:00:17	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: If you earn that little when working 10 hours a day, that is a fucking travesty
2014-10-31 16:00:48	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, apparently you've never been in a training position, nor do you seem to realize just how much one can receive in benefits.

2014-10-31 16:01:46	Happy-Ferret	My cousin receives 800 euros in benefits/month. As a trainee (software development), I receive just 600.
2014-10-31 16:01:57	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: I have receiving those benefits, while in a training position for two years
2014-10-31 16:02:09	DrMcCoy	And really, there's not much you can add there
2014-10-31 16:02:20	DrMcCoy	800 euros is including rent
2014-10-31 16:02:42	DrMcCoy	And even then, depending on where you live, you're going to get threats to move
2014-10-31 16:03:19	DrMcCoy	Unless you're not talking about ALG II
2014-10-31 16:03:55	DrMcCoy	In which case it comes from the money that cousin paid in while being employed previously
2014-10-31 16:04:03	Happy-Ferret	It's also a travesty that the Bavarian/Swabian tax payer has to make up most of the money of eastern Germany. I went there last Summer and their roads are beyond comparison. Nice work. Too bad they had to use money that wasn't rightfully theirs.
2014-10-31 16:04:53	DrMcCoy	Oh, yes, ranting against the Solibeitrag
2014-10-31 16:05:07	DrMcCoy	I really should have printed out that Bingo card
2014-10-31 16:05:28	Happy-Ferret	Lol. Solidarity isn't a one way street.
2014-10-31 16:05:30	stqn	Happy-Ferret: you’ve selected the wrong enemies
2014-10-31 16:06:13	Happy-Ferret	stqn, I really haven't. I've selected the very people making my life miserable by voting for people who benefit them the most while robbing me and my family blind.
2014-10-31 16:06:40	stqn	lol, left, right, the politicians are all the same, as I said earlier.
2014-10-31 16:06:57	@Samsai	maybe you've selected the wrong country?
2014-10-31 16:07:13	@Samsai	AFAIK there are plenty of countries without these benefits
2014-10-31 16:07:16	Happy-Ferret	It's not even as much about left and right as it's about working person vs bum.
2014-10-31 16:07:28	stqn	They are people who want power, get corrupted by power and rich corporations/people, they will not ever do things to improve the lives of everyone.
2014-10-31 16:07:32	disharmonic	Come to Greece and see how much you'll get paid as a trainee ;)
2014-10-31 16:07:39	Happy-Ferret	Samsai, trust me. I'll move there as soon as I've got the funds to do so.
2014-10-31 16:07:49	Raven67854	People get paid in Europe to be a trainee from the goverment?
2014-10-31 16:08:11	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, they usually don't.
2014-10-31 16:08:28	Happy-Ferret	There are certain benefits. But those are only available to a certain kind of people.
2014-10-31 16:09:00	DrMcCoy	Unpaid internships can work in "partnership" with the employment agency
2014-10-31 16:09:21	Raven67854	Also is it actually possible to live off 800 euro's a month?
2014-10-31 16:09:24	Happy-Ferret	Unfortunately, my parents are self-employed. Children of self-employed parents generally don't qualify for those benefits.
2014-10-31 16:09:28	DrMcCoy	Which is a win-win for the company: they free labour
2014-10-31 16:09:40	Raven67854	That just barely covers the rent on my apartment
2014-10-31 16:09:51	DrMcCoy	Really, unpaid internships need to die
2014-10-31 16:10:08	Happy-Ferret	That's at least one thing we can agree on, DrMcCoy.
2014-10-31 16:10:13	Raven67854	800 euro's is about ~$1,000 USD. I literally could not live off that
2014-10-31 16:10:38	DrMcCoy	The problem is that it's in the best capitalistic interest for a company to want unpaid internship. This is capitalism in action
2014-10-31 16:10:43	Happy-Ferret	My cousin has a spare 400 euros at the end of each month, so yea.

2014-10-31 16:11:09	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, it's not Capitalism. It's being an asshole. Totally different thing.
2014-10-31 16:11:12	disharmonic	Well, over here government sponsored internship is being abused a lot. And by abused i mean corporations getting perpetual free labor
2014-10-31 16:11:16	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Nope, same thing
2014-10-31 16:11:34	Raven67854	I doubt if I made 1k a month I'd have this apartment anyway.
2014-10-31 16:12:18	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, if it was the general rule of thumb, how come rich Capitalists even exist? By your very logic, everyone in a Capitalist society ought to be a poor sob since everyone's a complete and utter douche ...

2014-10-31 16:12:58	DrMcCoy	Raven67854: Well, the thing is, it breaks up like this: 399€, plus rent paid up to, I think 370€ (that includes heating, but not power or internet)
2014-10-31 16:13:04	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, Ah
2014-10-31 16:13:23	Raven67854	Well powering my place if you used every room would suck. I have a 213 square meter monstersity! <3
2014-10-31 16:13:36	Happy-Ferret	Anyways. I need to go offline, lest I want to suffer from a "DrMcCoy induced" stroke and need to rely on public healthcare.
2014-10-31 16:13:40	Raven67854	There's just no way you oculd afford it
2014-10-31 16:13:46	Raven67854	could*
2014-10-31 16:14:02	mirv_	Raven67854, heating bills for that size would be horrible during winter
2014-10-31 16:14:11	mirv_	at least, if were anything like heating over here
2014-10-31 16:14:15	DrMcCoy	Well, I really don't heat. Like, at all
2014-10-31 16:14:17	DrMcCoy	I like the cold
2014-10-31 16:14:26	Raven67854	Thankfully this place is brand new and top notch
2014-10-31 16:14:27	Raven67854	No leaks
2014-10-31 16:14:34	Raven67854	No way air can get in/out
2014-10-31 16:14:39	mirv_	I like hot weather
2014-10-31 16:14:40	Raven67854	triple panned windows
2014-10-31 16:14:40	Happy-Ferret	One last thing to keep in mind. My cousin actually lives at home and the agency is paying the rent to his mother. So of course the rent is rather low.
2014-10-31 16:14:49	mirv_	why I'm here, I've no idea...
2014-10-31 16:14:52	Raven67854	It's quite lovely
2014-10-31 16:15:04	Raven67854	mirv_, My electric bill in the winter is about $180/m
2014-10-31 16:15:07	mirv_	Raven67854, proper building construction is always nice

2014-10-31 16:15:28	Raven67854	In the summer I pay about $50-$90 depending on how hard I run the AC
2014-10-31 16:15:29	Raven67854	yeah

2014-10-31 16:15:36	Raven67854	Yeah
2014-10-31 16:15:42	Raven67854	But it's because I hav an eletrical heater
2014-10-31 16:15:47	mirv_	ah
2014-10-31 16:15:48	Raven67854	And those things suck
2014-10-31 16:15:49	Raven67854	I hate them

2014-10-31 16:16:04	mirv_	yeah they're not the most power efficient of devices

2014-10-31 16:16:25	Raven67854	It just depends on how cold it gets. If it's amild winter I can get away with under $150
2014-10-31 16:16:29	mirv_	bed is sounding really awesome
2014-10-31 16:16:47	mirv_	heh, I think I'll stop complaining when my gf leaves the lights on then
2014-10-31 16:17:15	Raven67854	mirv_, yeah I love this place. 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms
2014-10-31 16:17:25	DrMcCoy	Raven67854: Well, I have heating using central heating for the whole house (8 appartments + a hairdresser) and there's an oil furnace in the basement
2014-10-31 16:17:34	mirv_	2 bathrooms would be enough for me
2014-10-31 16:17:41	mirv_	one for me, one for the gf
2014-10-31 16:17:43	DrMcCoy	So heating isn't that expensive
2014-10-31 16:17:52	Raven67854	mirv_, Yeah! but it has 1 in each room so what you gonna do.
2014-10-31 16:18:05	DrMcCoy	Warm water comes from electricity here, though, so that's a bummer
2014-10-31 16:18:11	mirv_	Raven67854, I think it's more where you're going to do it
2014-10-31 16:18:12	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, same for me!
2014-10-31 16:18:22	mirv_	roll a dice!
2014-10-31 16:18:27	DrMcCoy	100€ power bill per month. I do have a flatmate though, so 50€ for me
2014-10-31 16:18:30	Raven67854	But this place also has brand new solar panels
2014-10-31 16:18:39	Raven67854	So I'm hoping this winter the power bill will be slightly smaller
2014-10-31 16:20:21	mirv_	we had solar hot water panelling in an old house
2014-10-31 16:20:45	mirv_	used an electric backup during winter
2014-10-31 16:21:52	mirv_	and it was next to a swamp, which was actually pretty good - no extra development to ruin the quiet around there
2014-10-31 16:22:05	Raven67854	mirv_, I'm in a forest
2014-10-31 16:22:09	Raven67854	Kinda
2014-10-31 16:22:14	DrMcCoy	mirv_: The first house they built there, it sank into the swamp? :P
2014-10-31 16:22:23	Raven67854	Sounds like living in florida

2014-10-31 16:22:42	stqn	eh, I live next to a swamp… but it’s not big enough to have prevented the construction of many houses and shops unfortunately.
2014-10-31 16:22:49	mirv_	DrMcCoy, quite possibly...but it would've surfaced in summer when everything dried up

2014-10-31 16:23:27	Raven67854	mirv_, what if its under the mud?
2014-10-31 16:23:36	mirv_	DrMcCoy, yeah, I figured that
2014-10-31 16:23:37	Raven67854	you'd have to dig to find it
2014-10-31 16:23:50	mirv_	couldn't come up with a witty reply
2014-10-31 16:23:56	DrMcCoy	mirv_: :)
2014-10-31 16:24:11	mirv_	Raven67854, hehe, that's what we did for fun
2014-10-31 16:24:26	mirv_	parents came back to find I'd dug a trench in the backyard for "army games"
2014-10-31 16:25:02	mirv_	they weren't impressed
2014-10-31 16:26:12	mirv_	damn it, humble widget still only takes paypal or amazon payments
2014-10-31 16:26:19	mirv_	I don't have either
2014-10-31 16:26:39	Raven67854	mirv_, doesn't both paypal and amazon take your card?
2014-10-31 16:27:02	mirv_	I thought you needed an account with either?

2014-10-31 16:27:13	Raven67854	Hey Nothing_Much!
2014-10-31 16:27:18	mirv_	if it takes visa card direct, then I might be in business!
2014-10-31 16:27:57	DrMcCoy	IIRC, PayPal can directly take a credit card without requiring an account
2014-10-31 16:28:06	mirv_	buying Forest of Doom direct from their site gets you all platforms + steam key, for the same price as via steam

2014-10-31 16:28:56	DrMcCoy	Though I wish there was another way round: I don't have a creditcard, but I do have a PayPal account. I wish I could get a virtual credit card from PayPal that takes from my bank account (without stupid interest either)
2014-10-31 16:28:58	mirv_	I can get it half the price if I buy it for android only via google play
2014-10-31 16:29:33	mirv_	DrMcCoy, that's why I use ing-diba
2014-10-31 16:29:43	Raven67854	I don't have a credit card!
2014-10-31 16:29:45	mirv_	visa card, but takes direct from a banking account
2014-10-31 16:29:46	Raven67854	I have a debit card
2014-10-31 16:29:57	Raven67854	Actually I take that back I do have a credit card
2014-10-31 16:30:04	Raven67854	I can't recall when I last used it though
2014-10-31 16:30:23	DrMcCoy	Raven67854: I have a debit card either. Or rather, an "EC Card", which is not equivalent to anything you can put into usual credit card forms
2014-10-31 16:30:33	DrMcCoy	s/either/too/
2014-10-31 16:30:33	GolliumBot	DrMcCoy meant to say: Raven67854: I have a debit card too. Or rather, an "EC Card", which is not equivalent to anything you can put into usual credit card forms
2014-10-31 16:30:55	mirv_	argh, no, you need a paypal account
2014-10-31 16:30:57	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Well, but that only works if you have a bank account with them, I guess?
2014-10-31 16:31:04	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Huh, you do?
2014-10-31 16:31:16	mirv_	so it's telling me
2014-10-31 16:31:33	mirv_	DrMcCoy, yeah, need an account - I fill it with money from my primary account
2014-10-31 16:31:48	Raven67854	mirv_, how much is it?
2014-10-31 16:31:50	mirv_	so nobody can drain off my money if they grab my credit card
2014-10-31 16:32:00	DrMcCoy	Right, but I have my bank account with a different bank
2014-10-31 16:32:01	mirv_	Raven67854, $9.99 (USD)
2014-10-31 16:32:09	Raven67854	What about amazon payments?
2014-10-31 16:32:11	Nothing_Much	Raven67854: yooooooooooo
2014-10-31 16:32:13	Nothing_Much	Hi everyone
2014-10-31 16:32:22	mirv_	trying amazon now...
2014-10-31 16:33:10	mirv_	ok, I have an amazon account, I can pay with visa through that
2014-10-31 16:33:43	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Basically, what I want is this: I want a credit card that takes directly from my Volksbank (BraWo), without me needing to pay any interest or fees or anything for the stupid credit card :P
2014-10-31 16:33:49	DrMcCoy	+account
2014-10-31 16:34:09	Raven67854	I have a debit card.. It does exactly that
2014-10-31 16:34:20	mirv_	DrMcCoy, yeah, basically what I have setup
2014-10-31 16:34:35	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Oh, okay?
2014-10-31 16:34:35	mirv_	not sure if I pay fees...if they are, they're bloody small such that I don't notice
2014-10-31 16:35:11	mirv_	I don't pay to have the credit card, because it's not a "true" credit card
2014-10-31 16:35:40	mirv_	I think postbank offers something similar now
2014-10-31 16:35:55	mirv_	Volksbank probably do as well - and if not, they should get right on it!
2014-10-31 16:36:34	DrMcCoy	Well, the thing about Volksbanken is that each branch does their own crap
2014-10-31 16:36:49	mirv_	ah
2014-10-31 16:36:59	mirv_	can be good, can be inconvenient
2014-10-31 16:37:01	DrMcCoy	I'm really not happy with my bank either at the moment
2014-10-31 16:37:27	mirv_	I chose postbank early on because I didn't need to worry about where in Germany I was
2014-10-31 16:37:36	DrMcCoy	I basically pay 20¢ per transfer, both to and from my account, with 30 transfers free per month
2014-10-31 16:37:48	DrMcCoy	Which is bloody insane
2014-10-31 16:37:50	mirv_	that's....stupid
2014-10-31 16:37:54	Raven67854	that is fucking retarded DrMcCoy
2014-10-31 16:38:30	DrMcCoy	They added that in the last year or so
2014-10-31 16:41:35	mirv_	I know of some internet banks in Poland that are really good - basically no fees if you pay electronically
2014-10-31 16:42:12	mirv_	if you need cash, then as they don't have their own ATMs, it'll cost you

2014-10-31 17:14:10	Nothing_Much	DrMcCoy: why?
2014-10-31 17:14:17	DrMcCoy	Because I hate systemd
2014-10-31 17:14:34	DrMcCoy	And here in Debian Unstable land, it'll cause everything to break
2014-10-31 17:14:40	Nothing_Much	how old are you and do you not replace your hardware?
2014-10-31 17:14:52	DrMcCoy	I'm going to move to Gentoo
2014-10-31 17:15:04	Nothing_Much	have fun with that
2014-10-31 17:15:13	Nothing_Much	so what's your age and do you not upgrade your hardware?
2014-10-31 17:15:20	DrMcCoy	I've ran Gentoo for a year
2014-10-31 17:15:26	DrMcCoy	On another system
2014-10-31 17:15:28	DrMcCoy	It was great
2014-10-31 17:15:43	DrMcCoy	Right now I have no monies to upgrade my hardware
2014-10-31 17:15:49	Nothing_Much	okay new questions, why do you hate systemd?
2014-10-31 17:16:16	Nothing_Much	and do your reasons affect the desktop side or server side of your distro that uses systemd?
2014-10-31 17:16:29	DrMcCoy	Because I want to big blob managing everything under PID 0
2014-10-31 17:16:40	DrMcCoy	no*
2014-10-31 17:16:55	DrMcCoy	I also hate systemd's approach to init scripts
2014-10-31 17:17:01	Nothing_Much	wut

2014-10-31 17:17:53	Nothing_Much	what the fucking hell are you doing on debian then?
2014-10-31 17:18:12	DrMcCoy	Being annoyed while disabling all the stupid automation every time I upgrade
2014-10-31 17:18:43	DrMcCoy	I'm also compiling my own kernel, have my own initrd, my own grub config
2014-10-31 17:19:06	DrMcCoy	I'm also installing nvidia drivers manually
2014-10-31 17:19:11	DrMcCoy	Because I hate it the way Debian does it
2014-10-31 17:19:48	DrMcCoy	All those things I found way better when I ran Gentoo for a year (on that other system)
2014-10-31 17:19:59	Nothing_Much	hey
2014-10-31 17:20:01	Nothing_Much	here's an idea
2014-10-31 17:20:13	Nothing_Much	why don't you make your own version of systemd that doesn't use PID 0 or whatever
2014-10-31 17:20:25	DrMcCoy	That's not the point
2014-10-31 17:20:28	DrMcCoy	I don't want systemd
2014-10-31 17:20:29	Nothing_Much	or make it good
2014-10-31 17:20:35	DrMcCoy	I don't want to make it good
2014-10-31 17:20:42	DrMcCoy	I dislike the entire concept of systemd
2014-10-31 17:20:47	Nothing_Much	then switch to gentoo already and stop waiting for the inevitable
2014-10-31 17:21:08	DrMcCoy	I'm currently shackled by my already set up system
2014-10-31 17:21:16	Nothing_Much	also, is the Unix philosophy supposed to be upheld to this day?
2014-10-31 17:21:16	DrMcCoy	I'm switching when I'm upgrading my hardware
2014-10-31 17:21:37	Nothing_Much	well when debian breaks when you upgrade it to systemd, you're gonna need to tolerate it
2014-10-31 17:21:45	DrMcCoy	No, I don't
2014-10-31 17:21:52	DrMcCoy	I just won't upgrade Debian then
2014-10-31 17:21:53	Nothing_Much	just switch to gentoo already, save time, switch your hard drive when you get your new PC
2014-10-31 17:22:05	DrMcCoy	Like I said, that's what I'm planning to
2014-10-31 17:22:20	DrMcCoy	My mind is already made up that I'm going to move to Gentoo
2014-10-31 17:22:41	Dezponia	Meanwhile in Fedora land all is well :)
2014-10-31 17:22:51	Nothing_Much	why won't you do it right now and waste time?
2014-10-31 17:22:53	DrMcCoy	It's just that, should the Debian move to systemd come earlier than me being able to afford new hardware, I'm not going to upgrade Debian anymore
2014-10-31 17:22:55	Nothing_Much	not waste time*

2014-10-31 17:24:13	GolliumBot	[ Unix philosophy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
2014-10-31 17:24:15	Nothing_Much	so like
2014-10-31 17:24:18	Nothing_Much	is systemd better?
2014-10-31 17:24:27	Nothing_Much	there's more than 1 unix philosophy
2014-10-31 17:24:37	DrMcCoy	Nothing_Much: What exactly is your problem? O_o
2014-10-31 17:25:41	Nothing_Much	just seeing a bunch of people bitching over absolutely nothing in terms of philosophy and not taking charge with making a better init system or whatever
2014-10-31 17:26:21	Nothing_Much	"taking charge" in the sense that rebels just say "fuck everything, let's make something better than systemd" and then wait for the adoption for that new init thing then watch systemd crumble
2014-10-31 17:26:25	DrMcCoy	There are already like a dozen of better init systems in the mind of people not liking systemd
2014-10-31 17:26:29	DrMcCoy	OpenRC, for example
2014-10-31 17:26:38	Nothing_Much	at the moment everybody's just bitching about philosophies and not doing anythingg
2014-10-31 17:27:04	Nothing_Much	oh okay, then tell the people in charge of debian or arch or whatever other distro out there to use that or an alternative
2014-10-31 17:27:21	DrMcCoy	They already know they can use that
2014-10-31 17:27:27	Nothing_Much	man, people love to complain and not do anything about anything, really
2014-10-31 17:27:45	Nothing_Much	DrMcCoy: so what is their problem and why aren't the leaders doing anything about systemd then?
2014-10-31 17:28:03	DrMcCoy	Because they have different visions
2014-10-31 17:28:26	Nothing_Much	what visions are they?
2014-10-31 17:29:38	DrMcCoy	Well, visions that align with systemd
2014-10-31 17:29:45	DrMcCoy	While others disagree
2014-10-31 17:30:19	DrMcCoy	Hell, I don't even care, I just don't like systemd. And I don't like Debian enough to keep following them on a systemd path
2014-10-31 17:30:35	DrMcCoy	Especially since I'm not agreeing with a lot of other things Debian did in the last years
2014-10-31 17:30:40	Nothing_Much	sounds like a bunch of old farts complaining about their old shit not being good enough for their outdated philosophies
2014-10-31 17:30:50	Nothing_Much	or rather, newer philosophies
2014-10-31 17:31:23	DrMcCoy	If that helps you sleep at night, sure
2014-10-31 17:32:00	Nothing_Much	there's really no reason for this "controversy", considering how it won't affect the desktop side of things
2014-10-31 17:32:12	Nothing_Much	but on the server side, I do see how PID 0 can be a problem on servers
2014-10-31 17:32:17	DrMcCoy	I don't care about the "desktop side of things"
2014-10-31 17:32:30	DrMcCoy	I care about the day to day operation of my system
2014-10-31 17:32:40	DrMcCoy	And yes, that includes worrying about systemd
2014-10-31 17:33:00	DrMcCoy	Because systemd takes over logging, takes over network management, takes over a lot
2014-10-31 17:33:21	Nothing_Much	very passionate over your distro, but it's still FOSS and you can fix it
2014-10-31 17:33:47	DrMcCoy	Like I said, I don't care enough about Debian to fix it myself on my loneself
2014-10-31 17:33:52	Nothing_Much	though as I said, if it controls everything, apparently 1 application can crash the entire system
2014-10-31 17:33:54	DrMcCoy	lonesome*
2014-10-31 17:34:04	DrMcCoy	Really, that's not the problem at all
2014-10-31 17:34:11	Nothing_Much	what the hell is the problem?
2014-10-31 17:34:14	DrMcCoy	If init crashes, you have the same issue
2014-10-31 17:34:34	Nothing_Much	just the fact that it uh.. does things to applications and daemons?
2014-10-31 17:35:15	DrMcCoy	Yes, a lot of things I'd rather see decoupled. Keep control over myself instead of giving control over to systemd
2014-10-31 17:35:32	Nothing_Much	you're still in control of systemd though, right?
2014-10-31 17:35:36	DrMcCoy	No
2014-10-31 17:35:40	DrMcCoy	Not as much as I'd like
2014-10-31 17:35:46	Nothing_Much	what does it limit?
2014-10-31 17:35:50	DrMcCoy	Which is kinda the point of systemd
2014-10-31 17:36:13	Nothing_Much	oh now I get it
2014-10-31 17:36:17	DrMcCoy	That's a feature of systemd, the idea behind systemd, that it controls a lot of things itself and not give control to the user
2014-10-31 17:36:31	DrMcCoy	I get why some people like that
2014-10-31 17:36:34	DrMcCoy	I personally don't
2014-10-31 17:36:39	Nothing_Much	old farts want control, mainstream, such as myself don't give a shit about any of that shit, just make shit work and make the best damned OS you can make for people
2014-10-31 17:36:54	Nothing_Much	like me
2014-10-31 17:36:58	DrMcCoy	Again, if that helps you sleep, sure
2014-10-31 17:37:14	Nothing_Much	but honestly, just to save yourself some time, just switch to gentoo already
2014-10-31 17:37:19	DrMcCoy	I don't care what you understand, don't understand or misunderstand either
2014-10-31 17:37:25	Nothing_Much	systemd is heading to debian 8
2014-10-31 17:37:37	Nothing_Much	which will be released sometime this November
2014-10-31 17:37:54	DrMcCoy	Sure, and I will just stop upgrading Debian then
2014-10-31 17:38:12	Nothing_Much	enjoy your exploits and insecure OS then
2014-10-31 17:38:13	DrMcCoy	Why do you want to order me around here?
2014-10-31 17:39:08	DrMcCoy	I've stopped updating Debian for a year before, only pulling in security updates and some backports, and some manual stuff
2014-10-31 17:39:18	Nothing_Much	not ordering, more like warning, though some enthusiasts run insecure distros, so it's probably not gonna be bad for you guys

2014-10-31 21:58:11	DaMadOne	But I have her accustomed to using Linux and I have no intention of letting her know that I do have win 8.1 installed (you have to press a key combo boot to bring it up) I really only have steam, origin(YUCK!) a few games and ESET smart security installed, thats it.
2014-10-31 21:59:57	DaMadOne	She is use to using Linux at this point and she uses Libre office to do her work..
2014-10-31 22:01:21	DaMadOne	and no one is the wiser.. I intend to keep it that way
2014-10-31 22:03:26	DaMadOne	I did my 1st semester "office" class using libre office and I got the highest grade in the class lol.
2014-10-31 22:03:45	DaMadOne	MS is a JOKE
2014-10-31 22:04:17	neffo_	wierd that you hide an os from your gf or whatever
2014-10-31 22:05:48	DaMadOne	I dont "hide" it.. with UEFI it is simply the default. if you dont press f8 on boot up you dont get the boot options
2014-10-31 22:07:44	DaMadOne	if you don't press f8 on my system.. then it boots to linux no questions asked. Grub doesn't show, and if it did windows is not in there
2014-10-31 22:08:52	DaMadOne	you have to press f8 to get the UEFI boot option and she doesn't know it exists.. and I don't plan on telling her lol
2014-10-31 22:11:11	DaMadOne	My gf is a "blonde" in the joking kind of way. She is still fully capable of using my PC. I have no DM installed.. when it boots, it boots to TTY1. She knows how to login and to type "startx" to bring up mu XFCE environment which she knows how to use.

2014-10-31 22:21:34	DaMadOne	Seriously.. if my dumb blond of a gf can use Linux.. anyone can. I don't understand why MS Winblows has the market share they do.

2014-10-31 22:23:58	DaMadOne	yep.. consistently my rig boots linux.
2014-10-31 22:24:09	neffo_	in the ui
2014-10-31 22:24:20	neffo_	20 years of looking pretty much the same
2014-10-31 22:25:05	DaMadOne	they screwed that with win 8
2014-10-31 22:25:15	neffo_	and they fixed it with 10
2014-10-31 22:25:35	neffo_	even 8.1 is pretty much 7 with a wacky start menu
2014-10-31 22:25:37	DaMadOne	too little too late
2014-10-31 22:25:54	neffo_	not really
2014-10-31 22:26:01	neffo_	vista was dead in the water
2014-10-31 22:26:12	neffo_	but 7 is immensely popular
2014-10-31 22:26:47	neffo_	the typical pc lifecycle means they can screw up and it doesn't really hurt them over the long term
2014-10-31 22:27:26	DaMadOne	I agree that win 8 performance wise was a step in the right direction. It runs the games I want it to fantastically. But I dont trust it a far as I can thorw is
2014-10-31 22:27:55	neffo_	my point in consistency is that you can hop on a windows 98 pc right now
2014-10-31 22:27:58	neffo_	and use it
2014-10-31 22:28:01	DaMadOne	I'm kinda drunk.. ignore my typos please
2014-10-31 22:28:19	neffo_	try doing that with a redhat 4 machine
2014-10-31 22:30:57	DaMadOne	I dont want to..  and it's not necessary.. XFCE has greatly remained the "same" for along time and it works for me
2014-10-31 22:31:29	neffo_	but xfce is basically the windows interface

2014-10-31 22:42:52	neffo_	but do you see my point?
2014-10-31 22:42:53	nykac	neffo_: I'd also try using xrandr on new machine to generate modeline
2014-10-31 22:42:59	nykac	neffo_: yes, I see your point

2014-10-31 22:43:11	DaMadOne	I admit at this point if I had to crete a xorg,conf from scratch I might be in a heap of trouble lol
2014-10-31 22:43:18	nykac	neffo_: but I think change is good. Its much easier to do now
2014-10-31 22:43:23	neffo_	right click on desktop
2014-10-31 22:43:24	nykac	DaMadOne: psh, anyone could do it now
2014-10-31 22:43:32	nykac	DaMadOne: `touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf`
2014-10-31 22:43:57	DaMadOne	well duh.. I could create it lol
2014-10-31 22:44:16	DaMadOne	I know what is going on when i edit it
2014-10-31 22:44:27	neffo_	vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2014-10-31 22:44:37	neffo_	"/etc/X11/xorg.conf" [New file]
2014-10-31 22:44:46	neffo_	doesn't work
2014-10-31 22:45:38	DaMadOne	create a working multi GPU, Multi monitor config for nvidia out of yor ass...
2014-10-31 22:45:50	neffo_	don't have to
2014-10-31 22:45:53	neffo_	it works out of the box
2014-10-31 22:46:02	neffo_	well not multi gpu
2014-10-31 22:46:03	DaMadOne	hell no it doesn;t
2014-10-31 22:46:09	DaMadOne	Im proof
2014-10-31 22:46:12	neffo_	but multimonitor is trivial
2014-10-31 22:46:18	neffo_	it just works
2014-10-31 22:46:19	nykac	neffo_: I thought a blank one would work for most things becouse of autodetection
2014-10-31 22:46:25	DaMadOne	hell no it dont
2014-10-31 22:46:55	neffo_	yeah it does
2014-10-31 22:47:05	neffo_	what OS are you using?
2014-10-31 22:47:37	DaMadOne	I run 2 gtx 580s.. 2 monitors are on one card and the 3rd monitor is on the second.. it most definitely doesn't "just work"
2014-10-31 22:47:53	neffo_	i said not multigpu
2014-10-31 22:48:09	DaMadOne	It's not hard to configure.. but it doesn't work "out of the box"
2014-10-31 22:48:12	nykac	for me I only have evdev configured staticly
2014-10-31 22:50:10	DaMadOne	lol. "what OS are you using"
2014-10-31 22:50:17	DaMadOne	Arch
2014-10-31 22:50:22	nykac	s/OS/distro/
2014-10-31 22:50:30	neffo_	same thing
2014-10-31 22:50:55	DaMadOne	not really.. Arch <> Ubuntu
2014-10-31 22:51:09	DaMadOne	two totally different animals
2014-10-31 22:51:16	nykac	neffo_: OS would be GNU/Linux for Ubuntu, Debian, Arch,Gentoo,Fedora...
2014-10-31 22:51:41	neffo_	nah it wouldn't be
2014-10-31 22:52:00	nykac	neffo_: also I interperetd that as 'are you runing GNU/Linux, a BSD or Minix'
2014-10-31 22:52:02	neffo_	if windows 7 and windows 8 are different OSs then so is ubuntu and debian
2014-10-31 22:52:08	nykac	neffo_: they aren't
2014-10-31 22:52:18	nykac	neffo_: they're different versions
2014-10-31 22:53:36	DaMadOne	omg..... ... ... ... ..
2014-10-31 22:54:02	neffo_	i'm confused by your point DaMadOne
2014-10-31 22:54:12	neffo_	you said arch and ubuntu are different animals
2014-10-31 22:54:28	DaMadOne	they are..
2014-10-31 22:55:20	DaMadOne	like I said.. I'm drunk.. I can't be pulled into this debate right now lol
2014-10-31 22:55:53	neffo_	for the most part people refer to different versions of windows as distinct OSs
2014-10-31 22:55:56	nykac	DaMadOne: having a good night?
2014-10-31 22:56:02	nykac	neffo_: I guess so
2014-10-31 22:56:04	neffo_	and it makes perfect sense for distros to be distinct
2014-10-31 22:56:07	DaMadOne	w00t!
2014-10-31 22:56:15	DaMadOne	i agree
2014-10-31 22:56:29	nykac	neffo_: I don't think distsos are that distinct
2014-10-31 22:56:36	nykac	neffo_: as long as its GNU/Linux
2014-10-31 22:56:50	neffo_	what about chromium?
2014-10-31 22:57:03	nykac	neffo_: and not something like mucl/busybox/Linux
2014-10-31 22:57:10	nykac	neffo_: chromiumos?
2014-10-31 22:57:18	nykac	neffo_: thats a bit iffy
2014-10-31 22:57:25	neffo_	the hint is in the name though right?
2014-10-31 22:57:27	neffo_	:P
2014-10-31 22:57:48	neffo_	and if you dual boot
2014-10-31 22:57:51	nykac	neffo_: hrm, chromium is based on gentoo, so you can just put it into dev mode and emerge stuff
2014-10-31 22:57:52	neffo_	or triple boot
2014-10-31 22:58:04	neffo_	say you have ubuntu and arch installed, along side windows
2014-10-31 22:58:07	neffo_	that's 3 OSs
2014-10-31 22:58:18	neffo_	its not 2
2014-10-31 22:58:23	nykac	meh
2014-10-31 22:58:32	neffo_	because they are distinct self-contained
2014-10-31 22:58:40	DaMadOne	ther is most certainly a difference from one dist. to the other..
2014-10-31 22:58:40	nykac	I'd consider debian/windows/freebsd to be a tripple boot
2014-10-31 22:58:59	neffo_	but you wouldn't called arch + ubuntu dual boot?
2014-10-31 22:59:04	neffo_	that's confusing
2014-10-31 22:59:10	DaMadOne	ubuntu = patched to hell usually old version of software..
2014-10-31 22:59:15	nykac	yeah
2014-10-31 22:59:31	neffo_	you wouldn't have the same /usr
2014-10-31 22:59:36	neffo_	you wouldn't have the same /etc
2014-10-31 22:59:40	nykac	neffo_: it'd be tripple boot because there are 3 boot options
2014-10-31 22:59:45	DaMadOne	Arch = up to date.. mostly unpatched pkgs and close to pure source
2014-10-31 22:59:49	nykac	neffo_: and 3 rootfses
2014-10-31 23:00:14	neffo_	DaMadOne: ubuntu uses backports, but they rebase too
2014-10-31 23:00:30	DaMadOne	blah blah blah...
2014-10-31 23:00:52	neffo_	they don't upgrade kernel versions typically within a release
2014-10-31 23:00:58	neffo_	but they backport drivers, etc
2014-10-31 23:01:12	neffo_	which makes sense
2014-10-31 23:01:41	DaMadOne	I was a Xubuntu user for many year.. In the end I had so may 3rd party ppa's and I kept up with the mainline kernel that I might as well have been running arch.
2014-10-31 23:01:47	neffo_	isn't arch a rolling distro?
2014-10-31 23:02:00	DaMadOne	yep
2014-10-31 23:02:41	neffo_	not really fair to compare that then
2014-10-31 23:02:52	DaMadOne	so I switched and I have not looked back
2014-10-31 23:03:52	neffo_	ubuntu 14.10 uses linux 3.16
2014-10-31 23:03:54	nykac	I would be running fedora on this machine, but anaconda has some bugs which make it hard to install in my odd mannor
2014-10-31 23:04:17	DaMadOne	If you are going to run *buntu and stick with what hey have availbale + maybe a couple of PPA's then great! stick with it..
2014-10-31 23:04:34	DaMadOne	I on the otherhand has so many PPA
2014-10-31 23:04:40	DaMadOne	s added
2014-10-31 23:04:59	DaMadOne	and  always ran the mainline kernel that Arch just made sense
2014-10-31 23:05:48	neffo_	ppas are aweful yeah
2014-10-31 23:06:07	neffo_	definately problematic on upgrade
2014-10-31 23:06:18	neffo_	but rolling updates aren't flawless
2014-10-31 23:06:57	neffo_	but doesn't arch still use some sort of staging?
2014-10-31 23:07:05	DaMadOne	yea.. I had to backup and reinstall every 6 months with *buntu anyways because I was soo far deviated from their base system
2014-10-31 23:08:03	neffo_	hah
2014-10-31 23:08:08	neffo_	clearly ubuntu isn;t for you
2014-10-31 23:08:38	neffo_	ppapurge is your friend
2014-10-31 23:08:44	DaMadOne	yea.. I admit I am a minority lol
2014-10-31 23:10:13	neffo_	i'm a pragmatist, and lazy
2014-10-31 23:10:22	DaMadOne	u know what though.. I used Xubuntu for like 6 years. I learned more about Linux in the year I have been using Arch
2014-10-31 23:10:45	neffo_	dual boot + latest ubuntu with just a few ppas (nvidia drivers)
2014-10-31 23:10:48	DaMadOne	than my entire time with *buntu
2014-10-31 23:10:54	neffo_	and the latest gnome
2014-10-31 23:11:02	neffo_	i hate things breaking
2014-10-31 23:11:05	DaMadOne	gnome.. gross
2014-10-31 23:11:21	nykac	DaMadOne: gnome isn't too bad with a touch screen...
2014-10-31 23:11:27	neffo_	and extensions
2014-10-31 23:11:31	nykac	but I much prefer xfce or kde
2014-10-31 23:11:36	DaMadOne	lol..I guess I'm weird.. I sorta like when things break.. it means I get to figure out why
2014-10-31 23:12:46	DaMadOne	I use XFCE and openbox.. I have my XFCE "pimped" out for my 3 monitor setup.. and I xinit openbox for my gaming needs
2014-10-31 23:14:52	DaMadOne	If I am goint to use GTK3 based anything it is cinnamon.
2014-10-31 23:15:41	DaMadOne	I do have cinnaon installed and use it for a few games that don't play nice with 5760x1080 and openbox..
2014-10-31 23:16:10	DaMadOne	turns out all of those games are Unreal Engine 3 games.
2014-10-31 23:16:35	neffo_	one of the best features of gnome is the overlay
2014-10-31 23:16:44	neffo_	handy for games that open on the wrong screen
2014-10-31 23:16:53	neffo_	like metro:ll
2014-10-31 23:17:04	neffo_	just drag it to the right monitor, heh
2014-10-31 23:18:25	DaMadOne	not familiar with that one.. I want games to open on ALL of my screens. but yes.. Metro:LL from an "runs in X WM" point of view.. it is awful.
2014-10-31 23:21:34	DaMadOne	For me @ 5760x1080 Metro:LL will only run in its own X server without crashing and I have tried XFCE,Gnome-shell, Cinnamon and Openbox.
2014-10-31 23:24:31	DaMadOne	nykac, I'm not one to talk "shit", I believe in the saying "To each their own", but gnome is fracking horrible!
2014-10-31 23:25:45	DaMadOne	It forces more "odd behavior" than Win 8.0 did with its "metro UI"!
2014-10-31 23:30:33	neffo_	it borrows a lot from mac os
2014-10-31 23:30:49	neffo_	but with a few extensions (default ones) it's pretty familiar
2014-10-31 23:31:02	neffo_	bottom task bar/ window list
2014-10-31 23:31:12	neffo_	top icons
2014-10-31 23:31:17	neffo_	etc
2014-10-31 23:32:23	DaMadOne	Call me old.. but the desktop evolved into what it is now because it works. With Win8 they tried to force a direction and(mostly) failed. Don't get me wrong.. Win 8 WAS an upgrade in terms of resource management and a nudge in the right direction and it feels as smooth as an MS OS can.. but (and I'm not going to mince words here)  Is the "best" win OS to date.. but it's a frackin resource hog... for what it "costs" myrig.. it hardly m

2014-11-01 10:56:34	Happy-Ferret	I was avoiding the Steam release since I already had the DRM free client installed before. Now my choice is between re-downloading it on Steam and re-downloading it as a DRM free release. Hm.

2014-11-01 12:43:13	von	works as expected
2014-11-01 12:43:30	@Samsai	i played it on the livestream, 3 out of 6 party members died in the first encounter :D
2014-11-01 12:43:54	von	you've got to get used to that gameplay, it's a bit old
2014-11-01 12:44:01	von	has its flaws
2014-11-01 12:44:15	von	it looks realtime, but it certainly is not
2014-11-01 12:44:32	von	use tactical pause a lot and save often
2014-11-01 12:44:44	Morgawr	I played (a bit, never finished) IWD1 and IWD2
2014-11-01 12:44:48	Morgawr	and BG, etc etc
2014-11-01 12:44:52	Morgawr	so I'm kinda familiar with those games
2014-11-01 12:45:03	Morgawr	is IWDEE a fusion of IWD1 and 2?
2014-11-01 12:45:03	von	no
2014-11-01 12:45:06	Morgawr	or is it just IWD1 + some extra?
2014-11-01 12:45:06	von	it's IWD1
2014-11-01 12:45:11	von	and an addon
2014-11-01 12:45:15	von	Heart of Winter
2014-11-01 12:45:17	Morgawr	ack
2014-11-01 12:45:18	Morgawr	I see
2014-11-01 12:45:32	von	IWD2 uses another ruleset
2014-11-01 12:45:47	von	IWD uses AD&D aka 2nd edition
2014-11-01 12:46:02	von	IWD uses D&D 3rd edition
2014-11-01 12:46:13	von	IWD2*
2014-11-01 12:46:58	Morgawr	btw I started doing some light streaming of games I play on Linux http://www.twitch.tv/morgonlinux although it's mostly csgo (atm making food)
2014-11-01 12:47:00	von	not to mention that they have completely separate stories, so fusing them into one game is pointless unlike Baldur's Gate
2014-11-01 12:47:00	GolliumBot	[ Twitch ] - www.twitch.tv
2014-11-01 12:47:04	Morgawr	in case anyone cares
2014-11-01 12:47:13	Morgawr	although sometimes I talk in Italian cause I play with Italian friends :V
2014-11-01 12:47:28	Morgawr	von: I'll buy IWDEE later (or tomorrow) and see how it goes :D
2014-11-01 12:47:50	von	although with IWDEE they've added some stuff from BG's ruleset
2014-11-01 12:47:54	von	kits, for example
2014-11-01 12:47:57	von	I like the stuff
2014-11-01 12:48:48	von	Morgawr, sure, imo infinity games enhanced editions are worth their price
2014-11-01 12:49:12	von	and yeah, those games are notorious for being bugged all over the place
2014-11-01 12:49:22	von	not Overhaul Games' / Beamdog's fault
2014-11-01 12:51:37	@Samsai	deer god's alpha seems to work nicely
2014-11-01 12:52:22	Morgawr	making OBS work + jack + pulse bridge + connecting all mic and stuff together and having a decent volume level for mic + bgm + in-game audio (in a way where I am comfortable playing) is a huge pain in the ass
2014-11-01 12:52:48	Morgawr	I wish more games and media applications exposed a jack layer
2014-11-01 12:53:02	Morgawr	so I could pipe the game's output to jack-specific plugins to enhance audio and stuff
2014-11-01 12:55:47	von	<3 jack
2014-11-01 12:56:17	von	wait, does OBS support jack natively?
2014-11-01 12:56:51	Morgawr	doesn't seem so
2014-11-01 12:56:55	von	:<
2014-11-01 12:56:57	Morgawr	I pipe it with pulse bridge
2014-11-01 12:57:01	@Samsai	Morgawr, i understand your suffering
2014-11-01 12:57:03	Morgawr	so I only have a "Microphone" and "Audio" ports
2014-11-01 12:57:11	Morgawr	so I can't do some volume-specific changes for each individual inputs and stuff
2014-11-01 12:57:26	Morgawr	I mean, I can do that with pulseaudio
2014-11-01 12:57:36	Morgawr	but then the video gets the same volumes as I do
2014-11-01 12:57:39	@Samsai	btw, thank you for reminding me to highlight yesterday's stream
2014-11-01 12:57:48	Morgawr	but if, instead, I wanted X application to sound louder in the video but not in my headphones, I can't really do that
2014-11-01 12:57:56	Morgawr	Samsai: you're welcome :o

2014-11-01 14:17:12	BitRic	so, is it worth the 15€?
2014-11-01 14:17:21	von	I'd say it is
2014-11-01 14:17:29	von	although my regional price is lower
2014-11-01 14:17:48	@Samsai	you can sink a lot of time into ziggurat, so i'd say go for it
2014-11-01 14:17:59	von	but I'm a huge fan of Binding of Isaac, so that kind of game works perfectly for me
2014-11-01 14:18:39	xpander69	Samsai, can you check what unity version it uses?
2014-11-01 14:19:10	xpander69	under .config/unity3d/companyname/ziggurat  i think.... player.log file should contain engine version

2014-11-02 08:17:37	erkin	Yeah, I liked it quite a lot.
2014-11-02 08:17:53	von	Transistor's made by the same team
2014-11-02 08:18:25	erkin	Yeah, the artstyle is pretty similar.
2014-11-02 08:19:18	von	Soundtrack and artwork is as amazing as in Bastion, gameplay is much deeper and story is hard to compare
2014-11-02 08:19:37	von	mostly because some people hated it, and some (including me) loved it
2014-11-02 08:19:48	erkin	I see. I'll check its soundtrack.
2014-11-02 08:19:59	erkin	Hope there are no spoilers.

2014-11-02 08:29:47	erkin	My gamepad doesn't work on majority of games. :/

2014-11-02 08:30:06	erkin	I tried three different gamepads on that.
2014-11-02 08:32:04	stqn	I’m guessing they are not xbox 360 pads?

2014-11-02 11:25:46	liamdawe	that's about as far as my image talents go
2014-11-02 11:26:01	Segata_Sanshiro	also need to change the link in the carousel to the new one - https://docs.google.com/a/fis.com/forms/d/1NbUFYg2xNqmLm-4bst1u7OD1CKCFe2tPCQMPFJW136c/viewform

2014-11-02 11:27:22	Segata_Sanshiro	thanks!
2014-11-02 11:27:43	liamdawe	no prblem dude, are you doing your stats article today are you?
2014-11-02 11:28:02	Segata_Sanshiro	yup, just need to add the image now and I think it's ready to go
2014-11-02 11:28:15	liamdawe	fantastic can't wait to give it a read Segata_Sanshiro
2014-11-02 11:28:45	Segata_Sanshiro	was just going to use a variation of the carousel one so we can just use the same one every month
2014-11-02 11:28:56	@Samsai	ah, the 32-bit question is excellent
2014-11-02 11:29:15	@Samsai	i wonder if we are going to see yet another "feral is so bad" argument in the comments :P
2014-11-02 11:30:15	liamdawe	submitted my info for this months survey
2014-11-02 11:30:24	liamdawe	lol that one guy really dislikes feral
2014-11-02 11:31:53	Segata_Sanshiro	@Samsai, that was a suggestion from the comments - thought it was pretty good
2014-11-02 11:32:12	@Samsai	yeah, it absolutely is
2014-11-02 11:32:26	@Samsai	i'm quite interested in seeing the results of that one
2014-11-02 11:32:43	liamdawe	Samsai: Segata_Sanshiro i'm going over the post now
2014-11-02 11:32:44	Segata_Sanshiro	why dislike feral? the XCOM port was really good
2014-11-02 11:32:54	Segata_Sanshiro	liamdawe, ok thanks :)
2014-11-02 11:32:56	@Samsai	Segata_Sanshiro, it was also 64-bit only
2014-11-02 11:33:07	@Samsai	and someone got mad when his 32-bit OS couldn't handle it
2014-11-02 11:33:22	Segata_Sanshiro	if either of you want to add the image then that would help a lot :)
2014-11-02 11:33:56	liamdawe	wow tropico 5, wtf is with the no results, impatient buyers buying before the port?
2014-11-02 11:34:25	Segata_Sanshiro	oh I see.... well depending on the percentage of the results - it's justified. But considering 32-bit will probably be really low, then there's no point in complaining if someone doesn't support 10% of an OS with 1-2% market share
2014-11-02 11:34:34	liamdawe	post looks good to me Segata_Sanshiro
2014-11-02 11:34:48	Segata_Sanshiro	ok thanks liamdawe
2014-11-02 11:35:24	liamdawe	we need someone to reddit post it when its active
2014-11-02 11:35:57	liamdawe	only thing Segata_Sanshiro, make the ending with the new link bold, needs to stand out more

2014-11-02 11:45:26	@Samsai	just saying
2014-11-02 11:45:42	liamdawe	if i didn't delete it i imagine some people would have replied to it hastily to defend me and created issues, and yes i was thinking we should

2014-11-02 11:46:10	Segata_Sanshiro	@Samsai, I agree, his stuff is really good
2014-11-02 11:46:55	liamdawe	Samsai: fyi right now i don't think contributors see the admin notes, do you think we should allow all contributing editors to see them? i've noted sensitive stuff in it before so if i do i would need to note that all editors can see it so to keep sensitive stuff to PM's
2014-11-02 11:47:57	@Samsai	liamdawe, i believe we should keep admin notes to full editors only
2014-11-02 11:48:41	liamdawe	the reason being is if someone asks in it say "does anyone want to cover x" a contributing editor may want to, but it's only sent to the main guys
2014-11-02 11:48:51	liamdawe	there is no other way other than making a big new pm to ask everyone

2014-11-02 11:50:11	@Samsai	hmm, i can see your point
2014-11-02 11:50:13	liamdawe	or maybe another box for all editors to see?
2014-11-02 11:50:29	Segata_Sanshiro	that's kind of something I mentioned in a message to you a while back @Samsai - like an easier way to distribute stories and make sure stuff doesn't get repeated
2014-11-02 11:50:42	@Samsai	i guess two boxes might be good
2014-11-02 11:50:45	liamdawe	Segata_Sanshiro: yeah that's why i am thinking it,
2014-11-02 11:51:02	liamdawe	i need to split up the admin home area anyway, as it now has like 3 different sections merged into it
2014-11-02 11:51:38	Morgawr	Samsai: I was streaming IWDEE earlier and wow... the first battle with the damn goblins... my mage got ohko and my bard soon after too
2014-11-02 11:52:01	Morgawr	I had to reload and be much more careful with the fights, now I send my berserker and barbarian in front of everyone to tank the damage and it's much easier
2014-11-02 11:52:05	Morgawr	totally did not expect that
2014-11-02 11:52:16	Segata_Sanshiro	liamdawe, the only issue I could come up with is that making that kind of stuff more public would make it easier for other sites to take news. but if it's contributing editors then it's not really a problem
2014-11-02 11:52:20	@Samsai	Morgawr, heh :D
2014-11-02 11:52:48	liamdawe	Segata_Sanshiro: yeah im just going to pop in another box that all editors can see
2014-11-02 11:52:54	liamdawe	that way no one can poach
2014-11-02 11:53:09	liamdawe	gonna split up the admin home area now into more sections as it's a bit full now anyway
2014-11-02 11:53:15	Segata_Sanshiro	sounds like the best approach
2014-11-02 11:53:19	liamdawe	ets 15 minutes
2014-11-02 11:53:26	liamdawe	ets? eta
2014-11-02 11:53:49	Morgawr	it's funny, this weekend my connection has had download problems (but no upload) so I can stream no problem but I cannot actually reply my videos
2014-11-02 11:53:54	Morgawr	fucking isps, how do they work
2014-11-02 11:54:02	@Samsai	magics
2014-11-02 11:54:11	Morgawr	and the funny thing is that ads always load instantly

2014-11-02 12:17:50	Segata_Sanshiro	in the admin there's one
2014-11-02 12:17:52	liamdawe	heh it's just obvious when he's used gol as a resource now, as it's always the same day, even when we are like 3-4 days behind

2014-11-02 12:18:25	Segata_Sanshiro	in the email too, don't know why i made that distinction.. haha
2014-11-02 12:18:27	liamdawe	i purposefully leave things a few days sometimes

2014-11-02 12:19:36	mirv_	it's also a little sad at the same time
2014-11-02 12:21:07	liamdawe	indeed, especially as there's no beef between us at all, but he still won't link me, i even link him a fair bit
2014-11-02 12:21:31	liamdawe	its why i keep saying he needs competition badly, to force him to step his game up
2014-11-02 12:21:39	mirv_	I've noticed that lxer no longer links there
2014-11-02 12:21:56	liamdawe	don't they? those are all manual submissions though

2014-11-03 00:51:20	NuSuey	what games do you like?
2014-11-03 00:52:10	BitRic	rpg's like neverwinter nights, oblivion, skyrim or more action-rpg like diablo 2/3
2014-11-03 00:52:51	BitRic	i'm a huge sports game fan, but on linux there isn't really something i enjoyed so far

2014-11-03 00:59:26	MBitRic	The strife community is nice. Rarely do I see any harassment
2014-11-03 01:02:44	NuSuey	HoN is awfull .. people yelling and bashing each other and conceding the games all the time.. dota2 is similar - but I like it more.. but I mostly get frustrated when I get some russians which clicked that they can speak ENGLISH in the menus, but they don't .. all you see is the azbuka and russian yelling and .. crap..
2014-11-03 01:03:33	von	MBitRic, I"ve tried it
2014-11-03 01:03:37	von	same shithole as dota
2014-11-03 01:04:10	MBitRic	I'm just frustrated at the moment

2014-11-03 01:13:35	NuSuey	well I haven't played much since F2P, but from that I know, you can buy some gear - but you can also get that from the dungeons, so it helps you - but you won't be the TOP OF THE TOPS if you invest some money into it.. (but don't quote me on that :P)
2014-11-03 01:14:16	NuSuey	if the expansion for WoW wasn't coming, I would probably play Rift.. really like the style and features
2014-11-03 01:14:17	gkeen	NuSuey: im all csgo now, dont even play HoN anymore :/
2014-11-03 01:15:37	NuSuey	really liked to play that naga or whatever that was.. :o played a lot of HoN, some years ago.. (before it went f2p, and just a few months after that)
2014-11-03 01:15:52	MBitRic	It feels like most games are only fun if you have people to play with
2014-11-03 01:17:49	mirv_	grab an amiga emulator and try Hired Guns
2014-11-03 01:18:45	NuSuey	well.. I do have one RL friend playing WoW, but I found like two people in game and we've added each other on bnet already - just because I'm nice and like to talk ingame :) and we do some dungeons and talk .. soo..that makes the game much more fun
2014-11-03 01:18:56	NuSuey	but in mobas - you don't get that..
2014-11-03 01:19:06	Varakh	buy transistor

2014-11-03 03:04:42	Happy-Ferret	I'm trying to write a simple display manager and this seems to be the most straightforward way to do it.

2014-11-03 03:05:25	sobkas	display manager?
2014-11-03 03:05:47	sobkas	for X or console?
2014-11-03 03:05:55	Happy-Ferret	For X
2014-11-03 03:06:03	mirv_	I think inittab can auto login to a virtual console...
2014-11-03 03:06:38	Happy-Ferret	I already know how to auto login. The problem is how to authenticate the actual user.
2014-11-03 03:07:21	mirv_	look at source code for gdm or xdm I guess
2014-11-03 03:07:55	von	pim?
2014-11-03 03:08:08	von	(I'm no expert, but isn't that the default way of doing things?)
2014-11-03 03:09:04	Happy-Ferret	I wonder how CDM does it.
2014-11-03 03:09:41	sobkas	take a look at LightDM it have separate greeters
2014-11-03 03:09:49	millan	Does anybody here have experience with running UE4 editor on Linux?
2014-11-03 03:11:09	millan	I am kinda sad
2014-11-03 03:11:33	millan	on their roadmap "Linux native editor" was set for September/October and it, uh /runs/, sort of buuut
2014-11-03 03:11:52	millan	I am struggling to even just grab a basic template and export it into something vaguely functional
2014-11-03 03:12:28	millan	not to mention I had to build it from source which isn't a REAL issue but it kind of shows they don't really have anything they would be proud showing off

2014-11-03 03:15:36	jaycee_	probably low priority
2014-11-03 03:15:52	jaycee_	content producers are more likely to be using windows, or os x
2014-11-03 03:16:20	jaycee_	and unless you use some cross platform ui kit to start with, ui code is notoriously nonportable

2014-11-03 03:24:43	millan	I wouldn't mind doing an UI fro scratch really
2014-11-03 03:30:47	mirv_	I think UnrealED4 uses wxwidgets
2014-11-03 03:31:16	mirv_	should be fairly cross platform
2014-11-03 03:31:33	millan	the editor itself runs quite fine visually
2014-11-03 03:31:39	millan	building stuff seems to be an issue
2014-11-03 03:32:17	jaycee_	mirv_, ugh wxwidgets, last time i used it it still needed platform specific bodges in places
2014-11-03 03:32:18	mirv_	that I can't help with - don't have a license for ue4
2014-11-03 03:32:53	mirv_	jaycee_, I haven't touched it in a long time, so I've no idea of how well it goes right now
2014-11-03 03:33:05	jaycee_	yeah neither have i
2014-11-03 03:33:29	jaycee_	last ui app i wrote was on osx, which has a lurvely ui system :)
2014-11-03 03:34:05	mirv_	if someone says "WPF", run away screaming
2014-11-03 03:34:15	mirv_	actually, hit them and then run away screaming
2014-11-03 03:35:19	millan	you can get a free UE4 license as a student
2014-11-03 03:35:38	millan	no monthly fee, and you can still publish your work with the same 5% fee
2014-11-03 03:35:54	mirv_	it's been a while since I've been a student
2014-11-03 03:36:11	millan	you just need a valid email at some school and they often last :p
2014-11-03 03:36:36	mirv_	is that a full source code access license, or just an engine license?
2014-11-03 03:36:51	millan	full everything
2014-11-03 03:37:02	millan	I don't think they have any partial licenses
2014-11-03 03:37:28	millan	you simply get to register into Unreal Engine organization on github, I am pretty sure you could do your own forks and everything
2014-11-03 03:38:26	millan	really it's the full deal, they just forgive you the $20/mo fee, everything seems perfectly complete and level with the paid for product

2014-11-03 03:40:13	mirv_	millan, good for students then
2014-11-03 03:40:35	mirv_	but I strongly suspect any uni would have something in place to have some level of rights to anything made using it
2014-11-03 03:41:44	millan	nope, I really don't think so
2014-11-03 03:43:00	millan	I am doubt my university knows about the program at all, and if they do, they definitely don't know about me in particular utilizing it - all I had to do was to punch in my university email in github registration, and confirm it through incoming confirmation email
2014-11-03 03:43:10	jaycee_	mirv_, it doesnt look that bad, but i dont really like C#
2014-11-03 03:43:23	jaycee_	so if i cant use it from C/C++ im not interested :)
2014-11-03 03:43:38	jaycee_	and well, bollocks to writing win32 ui code by hand
2014-11-03 03:58:53	Morgawr	I sorry I'm late but...
2014-11-03 03:58:53	Morgawr	12:03 < Happy-Ferret> Is there a way to supply a password to "login". i. e. "login $username $password"?
2014-11-03 03:59:01	Morgawr	^ this might be dangerous if the process is listed in htop or ps
2014-11-03 03:59:13	Morgawr	I know Happy-Ferret is gone but I just felt like throwing it in
2014-11-03 03:59:43	Morgawr	passing passwords as plaintexts outside of specific applications that are tailored to handle them is something that should never happen :V
2014-11-03 04:05:17	mirv_	jaycee_, I don't like c-dull either, but work forces me to use it
2014-11-03 04:05:42	jaycee_	well i dunno, as a language it has promise, but i dont really like all the .NET baggage it drags with it
2014-11-03 04:05:57	jaycee_	and i dont like that it makes linking with C/C++ code a hassle
2014-11-03 04:06:02	jaycee_	i prefer objc
2014-11-03 04:06:41	mirv_	I like my pointers
2014-11-03 04:08:02	mirv_	I got very used to them, and went to use C# - couldn't figure out how to reference different parts of an array
2014-11-03 04:08:07	mirv_	then I realised you couldn't
2014-11-03 04:08:26	mirv_	and I tried to remember my java days

2014-11-03 04:18:02	jaycee_	its not necessarily a bad thing that it doesnt have pointers, but its very annoying if youre used to them

2014-11-03 06:13:32	mirv_	as for how long...that depends on the dice rolls sometimes
2014-11-03 06:14:50	mirv_	don't have to use dice - can just say "this is my score / I won the fight"
2014-11-03 06:15:12	Morgawr	is it like a choose your own adventure book?
2014-11-03 06:15:30	mirv_	yep
2014-11-03 06:15:38	mirv_	but with an rpg element

2014-11-03 06:16:12	mirv_	if you've never played a fighting fantasy book, I suggest finding a free one first
2014-11-03 06:16:28	mirv_	try a pdf version or something
2014-11-03 06:17:22	mirv_	this is basically the same, but adds stuff, like a map, auto-character sheet tracking, etc
2014-11-03 06:17:24	von	it's like playing a pnp game, but alone

2014-11-03 06:18:19	mirv_	Morgawr, then you might enjoy this

2014-11-03 06:19:07	Morgawr	oh, neat
2014-11-03 06:19:10	mirv_	for the same price as available through steam
2014-11-03 06:19:12	Morgawr	Android might be neat for when I'm commuting

2014-11-03 06:47:37	kkit	i get the same vibe, but the gameplay is fairly different
2014-11-03 06:48:23	kkit	if you didn't like bastion, i doubt you'd like transistor
2014-11-03 06:48:25	tadzik	yeah, I think the pace is a quite a lot slower than with Bastion
2014-11-03 06:48:32	tadzik	so if you were bored with that one...
2014-11-03 06:48:42	kkit	i don't mind the slower pace sometimes
2014-11-03 06:48:58	kkit	kind of a nice change from my usual frenetic games

2014-11-03 07:03:57	Dezponia	zewm: The Fall is an amazing game with an excellent take on the Artificial Inteligence story concept. Its not so much hard as it requires some out of the box thinking since many puzzles are about bypassing your own AI subrutins and restrictions
2014-11-03 07:04:19	zewm	Yea I played it for a bit last night but I got stuck at one part

2014-11-03 07:58:29	jaycee_	dunno, did it on some servers from 12.04 to 14.10 and it worked ok. only thing that broke was apache configs because the format changed a bit
2014-11-03 07:58:34	jaycee_	but a desktop is another matter :)

2014-11-03 08:23:54	jaycee_	and it only bricked counterfeit devices

2014-11-03 08:27:44	DrMcCoy	I blame the system ;)
2014-11-03 08:29:16	jaycee_	tbh whats lame is that there is no standard for USB -> RS232 that doesnt need a driver, no standard USB class device
2014-11-03 08:33:21	DrMcCoy	Well, the FTDI chips do more than just plain RS232
2014-11-03 08:34:10	jaycee_	some of them do
2014-11-03 08:34:51	Sik	jaycee_: to be fair it wouldn't be much of a problem if those chips didn't try to pass for the legit ones (as opposed to just being compatible) although I have to admit I find it curious how the exploit was basically the same kind of stuff that tends to brick homebrew on real hardware

2014-11-03 08:34:53	 *	hugme hugs Sik, good vi(m) user!
2014-11-03 08:35:00	jaycee_	but a lot of the time its just used as plain usb->rs232. and there should be a class for that
2014-11-03 08:35:05	Sik	...not the bot again o_o
2014-11-03 08:35:24	jaycee_	Sik, the reason they pretend to be legit ones is so that FDTI's driver will work with htem
2014-11-03 08:35:38	Sik	Nonono, I mean they even have the same labelling on the packaging
2014-11-03 08:35:39	jaycee_	because there is no USB class for serial
2014-11-03 08:35:49	Sik	Rather than just using the same protocol
2014-11-03 08:36:04	Sik	(the driver only cares about the latter)
2014-11-03 08:36:38	jaycee_	no, the driver has to see the same vid and pid or it wont load
2014-11-03 08:36:44	Sik	The end result is that now a lot of hardware designers are considering avoiding the chips altogether since they don't know if they have legit ones or not
2014-11-03 08:36:50	jaycee_	well.. it would if you altered the .inf file but noone wants to do that
2014-11-03 08:36:59	Sik	...I mean the same physical outside

2014-11-03 08:37:07	Sik	Not what the USB driver sees
2014-11-03 08:37:09	jaycee_	Sik, tbh its pretty easy to ensure you get genuine chips - buy from an authorised seller
2014-11-03 08:37:23	jaycee_	its when you buy from other suppliers who cant resist cutting corners on price to make a profit
2014-11-03 08:37:53	jaycee_	and definitely dont buy them (or any electronics components for that matter) from ebay
2014-11-03 08:38:02	jaycee_	ebay is pretty much the #1 way to get fake parts
2014-11-03 08:38:03	DrMcCoy	Right, buy from an authorised seller with minimum buy amount and weird schedules
2014-11-03 08:38:23	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, rubbish, Farnell/Element14 are an authorised seller and have no minimums
2014-11-03 08:38:26	jaycee_	so are digikey and mouser
2014-11-03 08:38:38	DrMcCoy	And if you're getting a device manufactured, the manufacturer does the acquisition for you

2014-11-03 09:43:07	jasonm	if login could interact with pam as a user then pam wouldn't be secure no?
2014-11-03 09:43:18	Happy-Ferret	It seems foolish to me to allow someone full fledged access to root, even during login.
2014-11-03 09:43:29	jasonm	well that is the thing
2014-11-03 09:43:44	jasonm	it's fooling to allow a user to access the authing system as it can access it any time if that be the case
2014-11-03 09:44:05	jasonm	so they could write an app to interact with it, upload it to the system and run it, hence a brute force cracker locally
2014-11-03 09:44:26	jasonm	when in the case as it is now the app must be root to talk to pam, which are controlled apps
2014-11-03 09:44:39	Happy-Ferret	Well. The idea was to have a specific user account that normal users don't gain access to.

2014-11-03 09:45:04	Happy-Ferret	One that replaced root, with less access rights (just enough to start login).
2014-11-03 09:45:20	jasonm	because if one user can access it ( in regards to unix permissions ) what stops another user?

2014-11-03 09:46:43	jasonm	you would need to exploit login to hold root permissions

2014-11-03 15:27:08	DaMadOne	anyone else use irc through TOR? the ping timeouts almost make it impractical.
2014-11-03 15:27:51	DaMadOne	I don't exactly "need" it but since it is installed on this VPS I figured WTH.
2014-11-03 15:29:45	von	I don't see much point
2014-11-03 15:30:45	von	irc networks aren't the most secure things in the world, so making sure your connection to irc is not compromised is basically pointless
2014-11-03 15:32:53	DaMadOne	my main point was to hide the server I am coming from.. which I am remotely logged into from halfway across the world as it is.. I don't like how easily accessible the IP is from irc.
2014-11-03 15:33:03	DaMadOne	but I'm just a bit tin foil hat though
2014-11-03 15:33:24	von	on freenode you can request cloak
2014-11-03 15:33:46	von	although for some reason it's not there anymore in my case lol
2014-11-03 15:34:31	DaMadOne	yea.. I suppose that is what I will end up doing since connecting through TORI just ping timeout after a short time of inactivity
2014-11-03 15:34:50	DaMadOne	I wonder if allowing it to be a relay would help that.

2014-11-03 15:42:57	DaMadOne	plus i can access it easily on my phone/laptop on the go.. get around region locks for things and it's just nice to have a proxy for things some may not consider "above board" exactly ;)

2014-11-03 16:52:58	jaycee_	yes and well, that new gnome desktop, vomit
2014-11-03 16:53:30	jaycee_	ive only got it installed for testing purposes
2014-11-03 16:54:05	DaMadOne	i was REALLY surprised by the gnome usage percentage on the recent GOL survey stats
2014-11-03 16:54:25	DaMadOne	it is all but unusable IMO.. it is somehow worse than Unity
2014-11-03 16:55:24	jaycee_	unity is at least usable
2014-11-03 16:55:31	jaycee_	gnome3 is just a big fucking black mess
2014-11-03 16:55:47	DaMadOne	people talk crap about win8.. i prefer that heinous start screen to gnome any day
2014-11-03 16:55:49	von	they are both bad lol
2014-11-03 16:56:18	jaycee_	win8.1 at least lets you revert to a sensible setup now
2014-11-03 16:56:43	von	err, you mean start button and desktop by default?
2014-11-03 16:57:02	jaycee_	yeah
2014-11-03 16:57:05	<--	coeseta (~coeseta@95.89.155.143) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-11-03 16:57:10	DaMadOne	i dont mind 8.1 with classic shell installed and no hot corners or "metro" when I HAVE to use it
2014-11-03 16:57:12	jaycee_	and no metro wankery
2014-11-03 16:57:23	von	err
2014-11-03 16:57:27	jaycee_	that said, im sticking to using 7
2014-11-03 16:57:34	von	start menu is still replaced with the metro interface in 8.1
2014-11-03 16:58:21	von	and corners are pretty much still there, with a hideous tablet menu on the side after a short delay
2014-11-03 16:58:40	DaMadOne	classic shell.. give you win 7 style start menu
2014-11-03 16:59:04	DaMadOne	and allows you to kill hot corners
2014-11-03 16:59:19	DaMadOne	so it's just an upgrade win 7 at that point
2014-11-03 16:59:40	jaycee_	aye, cba to upgrade, 8.1 has nothing i want
2014-11-03 17:00:41	jaycee_	didnt bother with vista either
2014-11-03 17:00:46	DaMadOne	it seems to be a bit better at resource management.. but that is about it.
2014-11-03 17:01:44	jaycee_	and no, 8.1 brings back the start menu itself - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/change-the-start-menu-to-classic-view
2014-11-03 17:01:45	GolliumBot	[ Change the Start menu to Classic view ] - windows.microsoft.com
2014-11-03 17:01:54	DaMadOne	when MS was giving out free Windows Media Center keys I used KMS to activate and then used the "legit" free key to update to win8 with media center.. so I'm "legit" and I didn't have to pay for it
2014-11-03 17:02:40	DaMadOne	it brings back the start button.. that start button just brings you to metro hell
2014-11-03 17:03:05	DaMadOne	win10 brings back a start menu.. but it is ugly still.. its just a mini metro start screen that pops up basically
2014-11-03 17:03:52	jaycee_	ahh well, plenty of third party ones for free :)
2014-11-03 17:04:32	DaMadOne	yep! classic shell does the job for me.
2014-11-03 17:06:29	von	jaycee_, no it does not
2014-11-03 17:06:56	DaMadOne	Since I am assuming that win10 is going to be required for DX12 I hope classic shell updates to allow me to replace the "new" start menu lol. I tried the win10 dev preview in vbox. while it is a step in a better direction I don't want metro hell tiles in my start menu either
2014-11-03 17:06:57	von	otherwise I'd be using it on both instances of windows I boot occasionally
2014-11-03 17:09:26	DaMadOne	von. I was a win8 hater even more than I am win hater in general. It really is a viable upgrade from 7 if you use one of the free start menu replacements. I have not seen the metro ui since I installed win8 when it came out
2014-11-03 17:10:17	von	I don't really care
2014-11-03 17:10:34	von	I barely use that menu anyway, and I know my way around it (took me 20 minutes to get the hold of it)
2014-11-03 17:10:48	DaMadOne	lol. I don't give a rats ass what you use.. I was just letting you know
2014-11-03 17:11:04	von	nah, was talking about menu, not the stuff you told me
2014-11-03 17:11:08	DaMadOne	it's not hard to use.. it does suck though
2014-11-03 17:11:11	DaMadOne	oh
2014-11-03 17:11:56	von	I know of those replacements, but I'm reluctant to use them. Windows is a black box and I'm not sure how deep those changes go if I happen to install the stuff
2014-11-03 17:12:21	DaMadOne	I thought it might be ok with a touch screen.. and it is a bit better.. but I still wiped win8 from my Lenovo Yoga and installed arch on it the same day I brought it home
2014-11-03 17:12:34	von	I'm curious to see the pricing on windows 10. If the rumors are true and it is going to be a free update for those who own win8, I'll give it a shot
2014-11-03 17:13:49	DaMadOne	win is all but dead to me.. if linux gaming continues on the trend it is now. I wont even have a win install in a year or 2
2014-11-03 17:13:59	von	yep
2014-11-03 17:15:40	DaMadOne	as it is now the only machine it is on is my gaming rig.. everything else runs Arch. My gf uses Arch.. my dad uses it when he comes over. My win install serisouly ONLY has Steam, Origin, ESET and games.. thats it
2014-11-03 17:16:06	DaMadOne	oh and teamspeak
2014-11-03 17:17:02	jaycee_	linux gaming is waiting for steam machines. valve better move their ass
2014-11-03 17:17:12	jaycee_	also we're fed up of only having one series of gpu's we can rely on
2014-11-03 17:17:24	jaycee_	intel sucks. amd sucks
2014-11-03 17:17:39	jaycee_	so its nvidia or nothing, and the kernel people all but wage war on the nvidia devs
2014-11-03 17:18:03	DaMadOne	yea.. that aspect REALLY sucks
2014-11-03 17:18:38	DaMadOne	I use Nvidia.. but from a dev standpoint I'm sure it is aggravating
2014-11-03 17:18:55	jaycee_	very
2014-11-03 17:19:30	jaycee_	especially when we get slagged off for "not supporting opensource mesa drivers"
2014-11-03 17:20:45	DaMadOne	even Nvidia's drivers need some work. SLI is basically a nogo.. with a 3 monitor rig I WILL NOT BE GIVING UP I need it to work
2014-11-03 17:21:48	DaMadOne	yea.. you would think those running linux would understand it is mesa and not you
2014-11-03 17:21:58	DaMadOne	I take it you are a dev lol
2014-11-03 17:22:26	jaycee_	i work for vp
2014-11-03 17:22:44	DaMadOne	the witcher vp?
2014-11-03 17:23:22	DaMadOne	i know you gusy didn't make the witcher but you get what I mean
2014-11-03 17:24:46	jaycee_	yep
2014-11-03 17:25:49	DaMadOne	oh cool. I was damn surprised at what TW2 was eventually able to do with eON, good job
2014-11-03 17:26:49	DaMadOne	I don't care how the games get to my linux box (though I prefer native obviously) as long as they run well.
2014-11-03 17:28:50	von	yay, finished IWDEE
2014-11-03 17:29:01	von	the main story though, not the expansion
2014-11-03 17:30:28	von	works solid, no crashes or gamebreaking bugs
2014-11-03 17:35:53	DaMadOne	nice. I need to buy it when I get paid again.

2014-11-03 17:45:15	jaycee_	we can probably get it running faster still, just need time to optimise. we're not sure why we're slower than wine is on amd at the moment
2014-11-03 17:45:18	jaycee_	and neither are amd :)
2014-11-03 17:45:36	jaycee_	no doubt some wankyness in catalyst with the GL path we happen to use

2014-11-03 17:54:37	BTRE	SnowCrash, sad thing is: it's not a bad port. It runs as poorly on windows.
2014-11-03 17:54:54	DaMadOne	dont the amd guys just use gallium and the d3d state tracker to play it with wine? I would imaging it would be challenging to beat that out..
2014-11-03 17:56:05	SnowCrash	BTRE: Lot of truth there.
2014-11-03 17:57:07	BTRE	Still, they've gotten a lot of better. Back when HoI3 was first released, it was unreasonably slow.
2014-11-03 17:57:35	jaycee_	ugh dont get me started on paradox's games
2014-11-03 17:57:41	jaycee_	clausewitz is a piece of shit
2014-11-03 17:58:19	jaycee_	its hilariously bad on windows, we had to add several hacks to eON for the games of theirs we ported with it, because it does unbelivably stupid things
2014-11-03 17:58:22	SnowCrash	Yeah its awful which is unfortunate since I love playing EU4 even with its warts on Windows but its just unplayable on Linux
2014-11-03 17:58:39	Nothing_Much	Hi people
2014-11-03 17:58:46	SnowCrash	I'm very frustrated with it
2014-11-03 17:58:50	jaycee_	id hoped since i saw CK2 that they'd cleaned it up a lot with their conversion to GL
2014-11-03 17:58:57	SnowCrash	hi Nothing_Much
2014-11-03 17:59:07	BTRE	Funny, runs pretty well (as in about as well as windows) for me.
2014-11-03 17:59:14	BTRE	EUIV, that is.
2014-11-03 17:59:28	SnowCrash	EUIV has a lot of quirks but runs enough to be plenty playable
2014-11-03 17:59:31	Nothing_Much	yeh
2014-11-03 17:59:37	SnowCrash	EUIV pretty much ran in Linux until the new DLC
2014-11-03 17:59:40	Nothing_Much	what's up with everyone?
2014-11-03 17:59:44	BTRE	That's the compressed save thing
2014-11-03 17:59:50	BTRE	if you disable it, it runs as well
2014-11-03 18:00:03	SnowCrash	In multiplayer I have a bug where I crash when I ready up
2014-11-03 18:00:28	BTRE	IIRC the beta patch dealt with a multiplayer crash? Maybe that helps?
2014-11-03 18:00:29	BTRE	Dunno, I play singleplayer only.
2014-11-03 18:01:34	SnowCrash	I play mostly multiplayer which has always had stability issues so maybe that's why it seems more problematic to me
2014-11-03 18:01:37	SnowCrash	idk
2014-11-03 18:01:43	SnowCrash	What distro and DE are you running?
2014-11-03 18:02:00	BTRE	Arch and awesome
2014-11-03 18:03:30	Nothing_Much	eeirch lignux
2014-11-03 18:04:22	SnowCrash	ah neat
2014-11-03 18:07:48	jaycee_	arch does love to give hassle :)
2014-11-03 18:08:03	jaycee_	and too much effort for me. manjaro isnt too bad though
2014-11-03 18:10:08	DaMadOne	I've been on arch for about a year now with multiple PC/Laptops. No hassles here. updating on arch step #1) check archlinux.com to see if anything needs manual intervention and follow their clear steps. step #2) perform intervention if needed. step #3) update
2014-11-03 18:10:10	BTRE	Mmm, I'm not an Arch zealot by any means (use debian on server and mint on parent's computers) but it's pretty hassle-free.
2014-11-03 18:10:38	jaycee_	its too hard to get started since as it basically dumps you at a shell and expects you to do it all manually
2014-11-03 18:10:40	BTRE	Back in the openrc days there were breakages with updates, but haven't had one in quite some time.
2014-11-03 18:10:57	BTRE	Oh, well, yeah. I think they should bring back the installer.
2014-11-03 18:10:58	jaycee_	sorry but that approach is too eliteist for me. give me an installer, or sod off tbh
2014-11-03 18:11:06	DaMadOne	lol
2014-11-03 18:11:08	jaycee_	same applies to gentoo
2014-11-03 18:11:22	DaMadOne	I thought something was wrong the first time I booted the install usb
2014-11-03 18:11:50	BTRE	Different strokes. Knowing how to manage xorg/DEs was interesting for me to learn.
2014-11-03 18:12:18	DaMadOne	yea, i've learned more about linux in the past year than the previous 5-6 using xubuntu
2014-11-03 18:12:28	jaycee_	its fine if you want to learn it, but you can learn that on any distro
2014-11-03 18:12:31	DaMadOne	i'm better for it. It's not for everyone though
2014-11-03 18:12:43	jaycee_	just saying "heres a shell, learn it, n00b" is lame
2014-11-03 18:13:05	jaycee_	hell i'll even take a script, doesnt have to be a graphical installer
2014-11-03 18:13:07	BTRE	It's just their approach. I think having the choice of a distro that doesn't hold your hand is valuable for those who want it.
2014-11-03 18:13:16	SnowCrash	I'm strongly considering a switch to Arch
2014-11-03 18:13:18	DaMadOne	it does help to keep out some of the noobs though.. some call that elitist.. I call it GOOD!
2014-11-03 18:13:18	jaycee_	BTRE, then offer that as a mode of install
2014-11-03 18:13:22	BTRE	jaycee_, there's always the arch ultimate install script
2014-11-03 18:13:32	SnowCrash	Especially since I feel like my Linux knowledge has climbed since I switched to it on Desktop
2014-11-03 18:13:34	BTRE	well, it's their distro, they get to pick how they want to do it.
2014-11-03 18:13:51	BTRE	There's spinoffs that do have installers/guis for setup
2014-11-03 18:13:55	BTRE	so I don't see it as a big deal
2014-11-03 18:14:06	jaycee_	and as a developer, i get to think theyre elitist twats for doing it :)
2014-11-03 18:14:18	jaycee_	so yeah, i found manjaro, thats good enough for testing
2014-11-03 18:14:26	jaycee_	arch is generally a pain in the arse for binary-only stuff
2014-11-03 18:14:48	jaycee_	since as they want to use bleeding edge everything which usually means breakage with anything not compiled
2014-11-03 18:15:16	BTRE	It's not quite bleeding edge though. Things are tested for stability, stuff like kernels are held back for weeks.
2014-11-03 18:16:01	DaMadOne	I've not had a single thing I could not run under arch that I can think of
2014-11-03 18:16:39	jaycee_	we had trouble with w2 but most of it seemed to be down to nvidia binary driver not playing nice
2014-11-03 18:16:49	DaMadOne	for games.. I tend to stick to steam mostly.. but even non steam games I've been able to run without issue
2014-11-03 18:17:28	DaMadOne	tw2 in arch would be played through steam.. so you would be dealing with steams runtime.. not arch necessarily.
2014-11-03 18:17:32	DaMadOne	now the driver thing I dunno
2014-11-03 18:17:48	DaMadOne	I don't even usearch's packages for nvidia. I do it manually
2014-11-03 18:17:56	jaycee_	yeah we had shit with steam-runtime and arch too
2014-11-03 18:18:07	DaMadOne	hmm.. wonder why
2014-11-03 18:18:31	jaycee_	"out of date packages in steam runtime".. because they werent bleeding edge, theyre from a debian stable branch
2014-11-03 18:18:37	SnowCrash	Steam only "officially supports" Ubuntu
2014-11-03 18:18:39	DaMadOne	you guys must have figured it out in the end. It's completely playable for me now
2014-11-03 18:18:41	jaycee_	so then most arch people decide to disable it
2014-11-03 18:18:59	<--	Aeterne (~quassel@cm-84.208.95.235.getinternet.no) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2014-11-03 18:19:01	DaMadOne	oh.. well that is their own damn fault then
2014-11-03 18:19:17	DaMadOne	i at least understand the "importance" of the steam runtime
2014-11-03 18:20:05	DaMadOne	I like being up to date and it is one of the reasons I like Arch.. but I know when to fold em..
2014-11-03 18:21:19	jaycee_	to be fair theres some things in steam-runtime that piss me off, and the sdk seems to be using an old gcc
2014-11-03 18:21:35	jaycee_	ive already hit 2 bugs in that particular version of gcc i know are fixed
2014-11-03 18:21:45	SnowCrash	that's frustrating
2014-11-03 18:22:11	DaMadOne	yea I can imagine that is frustrating.. is it a PITA to get them to update things when needed?
2014-11-03 18:22:40	DaMadOne	or do they basically stick to what ubuntu has out?

2014-11-03 18:25:13	DaMadOne	i mean I know what is there.. but how dated it is i dunno
2014-11-03 18:29:16	jaycee_	their old gcc isnt even anything to do with the debian packages, its a custom build with crosstool-ng
2014-11-03 18:30:15	SnowCrash	I don't know a whole lot of people gaming on Debian stable but I suppose it works, at the rate you have to build so much custom stuff it might as well be unstable.
2014-11-03 18:30:26	jaycee_	thered be less of a need for it if multiarch just fucking worked
2014-11-03 18:33:19	DaMadOne	But it does give game devs a common set of libs and built tools to work with and still be able to get linux games to the distros nobody wants to support (Arch lol), but still wants to be able to sell games too. Linux is fragmented like a mother fucker
2014-11-03 18:33:59	jaycee_	DISTRO FRAGMENTATION DOESNT EXIST!
2014-11-03 18:34:00	jaycee_	apparently
2014-11-03 18:34:01	SnowCrash	be careful not to suggest cleaning up that fragmentation, people will get furious at the very thought :P

2014-11-03 18:34:08	DaMadOne	with less fuss than it would be otherwise at least
2014-11-03 18:34:17	DaMadOne	lol
2014-11-03 18:34:52	DaMadOne	how can anyone say it isn't with a straight face

2014-11-03 18:37:41	SnowCrash	hah gawd the systemd rage
2014-11-03 18:37:50	SnowCrash	I just want a little less fragmentation
2014-11-03 18:37:59	SnowCrash	so things can be "not awful"
2014-11-03 18:38:09	 *	SnowCrash makes unreasonable requests
2014-11-03 18:38:40	DaMadOne	BUt but but, then it would be windows or OSX and the Unix philosophy man!
2014-11-03 18:40:16	DaMadOne	dont ever forget the unix philosophy.. even though we are running linux and are not or ever have been a "sanctioned" unicie...

2014-11-03 18:40:55	SnowCrash	heheh
2014-11-03 18:41:02	SnowCrash	at any rate I think it will get better in the future
2014-11-03 18:41:06	SnowCrash	at least a little better

2014-11-03 18:51:20	jaycee_	hmm nice, manjaro is using nvidia driver 343.22 and that seems to have gained performance in w2
2014-11-03 18:51:33	Raven67854	I use Nvidia 343.22
2014-11-03 18:53:24	jaycee_	still need to find out why some places cause gpu usage to drop to around 65-70%
2014-11-03 18:54:18	jaycee_	i reckon using a futex for our d3d9 mutex lock instead of pthread_mutex_t will help quite a bit
2014-11-03 18:56:32	DaMadOne	over my head :( my programming skills consist of knowledge I have forgotten from a Pascal class I took in 9th grade and very rust visual basic skills =/
2014-11-03 18:57:57	SnowCrash	My programming experience is mostly in .NET as that's what I do at work
2014-11-03 18:58:36	DaMadOne	i've hacked on android a bit, but that was very much just learn exactly enough java to be able to do what I wanted
2014-11-03 19:00:04	DaMadOne	I taught myself VB when I was 12.. I wrote a fairly full featured IRC client and a Honda ECU bin editor. but that was many moons ago
2014-11-03 19:00:45	jaycee_	basic at 8, 68000 asm on the amiga at 13, pascal at 16, C++ not long after :)
2014-11-03 19:00:48	DaMadOne	I've sat down at an IDE a few times over the years and I just lack direction on what the hell to try and create.
2014-11-03 19:01:45	DaMadOne	I can't grab a book and learn. I need to sit down, have a problem (or project) and then overcome it.
2014-11-03 19:01:52	jaycee_	bedtime &
2014-11-03 19:02:18	DaMadOne	later jaycee_
2014-11-03 19:04:15	DaMadOne	anyone else on Arch use guake? (Guake the terminal not Quake the game ;))
2014-11-03 19:05:20	DaMadOne	after I updated both my latptop and my main pc this weekend I no longer get guake's icon in my systray on either. It is just an X, and I can't recall guake updating

2014-11-03 19:15:36	DaMadOne	odd.. it seems to be icon theme.. which is not a pkg and I have not changed it.
2014-11-03 19:16:30	SnowCrash	strange
2014-11-03 19:18:22	DaMadOne	or other icon "themes" are overwriting it while my OSDark theme is not anymore.

2014-11-04 04:12:53	Morgawr	I'm still wondering what kind of case sensitivity issues Aspyr is having on Linux
2014-11-04 04:12:58	Morgawr	just convert everything to lowercase
2014-11-04 04:13:08	Morgawr	it's a 10 lines bash script or sed
2014-11-04 04:13:12	Morgawr	(at best)
2014-11-04 04:13:55	Coolgeek	tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
2014-11-04 04:15:22	Morgawr	Coolgeek: yeah I was giving them the benefit of the doubt :P
2014-11-04 04:17:13	flesk_	Maybe there's a distinction between equal strings in mixed case in the original code.
2014-11-04 04:18:51	jaycee_	suppose you cant control it, eg steam doesnt always respect case
2014-11-04 04:18:57	Morgawr	yeah that's why you use sed or strings.toLower() :P
2014-11-04 04:19:03	Morgawr	just put everything to lower case and you're done
2014-11-04 04:19:06	flesk_	Not that I see why that would cause too much issues.
2014-11-04 04:19:16	flesk_	*many
2014-11-04 04:19:29	Morgawr	they most likely have stuff like SaveGame("game.sav") -> LoadGame("Game.Sav")
2014-11-04 04:19:32	Morgawr	:D
2014-11-04 04:20:09	jaycee_	also linux is the only platform where this is a hassle
2014-11-04 04:20:16	NuSuey	wher eis bitric :o
2014-11-04 04:21:08	Morgawr	jaycee_: linux is the only reasonable platform apparently :P
2014-11-04 04:21:14	jaycee_	no seriously
2014-11-04 04:21:32	jaycee_	case sensitive fs is just stupid, even more stupid is that the kernel enforces it
2014-11-04 04:21:40	jaycee_	macs let you have either
2014-11-04 04:23:08	jaycee_	also stupid is that there is no standard encoding, its just "binary" and you need to hope that the system's encoding didnt change
2014-11-04 04:23:31	Morgawr	I don't agree but I think we've had this conversation before
2014-11-04 04:23:49	jaycee_	yep and my standpoint wont change. only devout linux peeps defend what is a very stupid design decision
2014-11-04 04:23:56	von	Morgawr, I think the issue is not in filenames
2014-11-04 04:24:00	von	but in scripts that utilize file names
2014-11-04 04:24:15	Morgawr	different cases map to different glyphs, different glyphs are just, well, different. Otherwise we'd be mapping the japanese "wa" symbol to the characters "w" + "a" or the cyrillic equivalent of latin letters
2014-11-04 04:24:23	von	people name files like SomeCamelCase.lua, but invoke them as somecamelcase.lua
2014-11-04 04:24:29	von	or the other way around
2014-11-04 04:24:37	Morgawr	von: yeah, definitely
2014-11-04 04:24:39	von	there is no simple way to predict what to do with that shit
2014-11-04 04:24:41	jaycee_	von, well its not too hard to trap everything at the open() stage
2014-11-04 04:24:51	Morgawr	von: which is why I think a properly crafted sed + bash script to lowercase everything should fix this in a couple of hours top :P
2014-11-04 04:24:58	jaycee_	but may be harder in things like Lua or other libs where you cant intercept that call
2014-11-04 04:25:06	von	yep
2014-11-04 04:25:09	jaycee_	Morgawr, you cannot just blindly alter data files
2014-11-04 04:25:31	jaycee_	suppose for example, they are checksummed as an anti-cheat or network sync method
2014-11-04 04:25:43	von	you have to carefully search to calls to files within the user-written scripts
2014-11-04 04:25:46	von	*for
2014-11-04 04:25:52	Morgawr	if only they had access to the source code of the game they are developing to fix it :)
2014-11-04 04:26:09	jaycee_	also if you are distributing on a platform like steam, you may not want or be able to alter the data files
2014-11-04 04:26:30	jaycee_	tldr - "just make it lower case" is not always a possible or easy solution
2014-11-04 04:26:35	Morgawr	I'm pretty sure steam lets you download different data files depending on the platform, that's not an issue otherwise porting wouldn't be possible at all

2014-11-04 04:26:44	von	not with user-made content in workshop =/
2014-11-04 04:26:48	jaycee_	Morgawr, it does but would you want to duplicate gigs of data ?
2014-11-04 04:27:08	jaycee_	disclaimer: i work in porting, ive done this before
2014-11-04 04:27:14	Morgawr	jaycee_: you have to do it anyway if you want to solve this issue, or backport the solution to the other platforms too? (since putting all lowercase is not an issue on OSX and Windows too)
2014-11-04 04:27:17	von	iirc that's what Aspyr do with Civ5, for instance - everything in lowercase
2014-11-04 04:27:32	Morgawr	von: that's a good point, but I recall them releasing civ 5 without workshop on Linux and I'd rather have a game running now without workshop
2014-11-04 04:27:45	jaycee_	Morgawr, right and the windows publisher is going to push your large changes, requiring testing and QA, for absolutely no benefit on that platform?
2014-11-04 04:27:45	von	err
2014-11-04 04:27:46	Morgawr	jaycee_: I've worked in porting as well, don't worry :P
2014-11-04 04:27:48	jaycee_	hint - it wont happen
2014-11-04 04:28:02	jaycee_	obviously not commercially
2014-11-04 04:28:16	Morgawr	not at this scale, but commercially
2014-11-04 04:28:22	von	Morgawr, I might have missed part of the conversation, what game are you talking about?
2014-11-04 04:28:32	Raven67854	Morgawr, don't you work for gog?
2014-11-04 04:28:44	Morgawr	Raven67854: I did as a contractor for the summer
2014-11-04 04:28:50	Morgawr	now I'm at Google doing an internship
2014-11-04 04:28:57	Morgawr	von: Civ:BE
2014-11-04 04:29:09	jaycee_	and why is it linux people just will not accept flaws in their system and attack anyone who points them out :P
2014-11-04 04:29:15	von	ah
2014-11-04 04:29:29	Raven67854	jaycee_, I'm fine with people pointing out "flaws"
2014-11-04 04:29:37	Morgawr	I don't honestly see any good reason to think case sensitive to be worse than case insensitive, case insensitive does not honestly make any sense to me
2014-11-04 04:29:44	Raven67854	People constantly bitching about things that Linux doesn't do that other OS does no
2014-11-04 04:29:46	von	Morgawr, I think they've said "workshop on release if we manage to do it, no promises", no?
2014-11-04 04:29:47	jaycee_	because youre a linux fan
2014-11-04 04:29:49	Raven67854	I like case sensative
2014-11-04 04:29:59	jaycee_	to every normal user, they prefer insensitive
2014-11-04 04:30:03	jaycee_	preserving but insensitive
2014-11-04 04:30:15	Morgawr	as I said before, multiple languages and encodings map to different characters with the same "meaning", if we want to consider case insensitive stuff then we should map cyrillic symbols to their latin equivalent, or japanese kana to their syllable equivalent, etc etc
2014-11-04 04:30:23	jaycee_	windows is insensitive, osx defaults to insensitive, for a good reason
2014-11-04 04:30:25	jaycee_	its what people want
2014-11-04 04:30:35	Morgawr	von: I don't know, I haven't followed too close, it'd be nice ot have workshop but so far I just want the game asap :P
2014-11-04 04:30:47	jaycee_	Morgawr, that is not what being case insensitive means at all
2014-11-04 04:31:00	jaycee_	youre talking about language translation
2014-11-04 04:31:03	Morgawr	case insensitive means that 'A' and 'a' are seen as the same
2014-11-04 04:31:13	Morgawr	but what stops me from using a different 'A'?
2014-11-04 04:31:19	Morgawr	why should we stop at lower/upper case?
2014-11-04 04:31:27	Morgawr	they are, for all intents and purposes, different glyphs
2014-11-04 04:31:31	Morgawr	and should be treated as different
2014-11-04 04:31:36	jaycee_	because thats what *case insensitive* means
2014-11-04 04:31:40	jaycee_	emphasis on *case*
2014-11-04 04:31:54	Morgawr	and?
2014-11-04 04:32:10	jaycee_	there is no real reason you would want files on disk called "readme" "README" and "ReadMe" to all be different
2014-11-04 04:32:12	jaycee_	none at all
2014-11-04 04:32:12	Morgawr	again, if you think *case* insensitive makes sense, then make it *glyph* insensitive
2014-11-04 04:32:15	Morgawr	otherwise it doesn't make sense
2014-11-04 04:32:17	von	err
2014-11-04 04:32:27	von	Morgawr, you're being illogical
2014-11-04 04:32:46	Morgawr	how so?
2014-11-04 04:32:52	jaycee_	yes he is, to get out of the "linux forcing case sensitivity is stupid" issue. this is the problem with linux
2014-11-04 04:33:06	von	Morgawr, because case sensitivity exists within those glygh sets, not alongside with them
2014-11-04 04:33:22	Morgawr	this has nothing to do with Linux, I'm not a Linux fanboy, most operating systems (and programming languages) are case sensitive
2014-11-04 04:33:24	jaycee_	someone points out anything dumb with linux, attack attack attack and use whatever argument, no matter how illogical, to argue against it. bonus points if you work in an insult against Windows
2014-11-04 04:33:31	Morgawr	this has zero to do with Linux
2014-11-04 04:33:34	jaycee_	Morgawr, er what? no theyre not
2014-11-04 04:33:45	jaycee_	show me another OS that forces case sensitivity in the filesystem
2014-11-04 04:33:45	von	jaycee_, it's not exactly stupid, it's just legacy thing because of simplicity of implementation
2014-11-04 04:33:54	von	at least that's how I see it
2014-11-04 04:34:03	jaycee_	von, right, well its a legacy that should be gotten rid of - but one that is viciously defended by linux geeks
2014-11-04 04:34:07	jaycee_	"because"
2014-11-04 04:34:08	Raven67854	von, Shut up von you're stupid!
2014-11-04 04:34:14	Morgawr	Linux doesn't force case sensitivity either, as far as I know, it's a filesystem-related issue, there are file systems and fuse modules that are case insensitive (correct me if I'm wrong) on Linux
2014-11-04 04:34:19	Raven67854	von, that defense works pretty well
2014-11-04 04:34:25	jaycee_	no, the kernel does filename matching
2014-11-04 04:34:28	Morgawr	OSX has case sensitive file systems, BSD is case sensitive, Minix is case sensitive
2014-11-04 04:34:30	jaycee_	and it's always binary
2014-11-04 04:34:31	von	Morgawr, yes, but using them is kinda ugly =/
2014-11-04 04:34:33	Morgawr	anyhow, time for lunch now, brb
2014-11-04 04:34:41	jaycee_	i said FORCED case sensitivity
2014-11-04 04:34:49	jaycee_	and minix, lol
2014-11-04 04:35:34	von	jaycee_, I agree that it would be advantageous for linux to implement optional case insensitivity
2014-11-04 04:35:36	jaycee_	shrug, enjoy having few games come to linux because of a stupid small obstacle that serves no purpose :)
2014-11-04 04:35:45	jaycee_	von, yes, but it wont happen
2014-11-04 04:36:04	jaycee_	because as soon as you mention it, linux worshippers scream and accuse you of being a windows fanboy
2014-11-04 04:36:18	@Samsai	so case sensitivity will block games from coming to linux?
2014-11-04 04:36:29	von	it does not exactly block
2014-11-04 04:36:33	jaycee_	Samsai, its yet another obstacle that is not a problem on other OS's
2014-11-04 04:36:39	jaycee_	just one more strike against
2014-11-04 04:36:40	DrMcCoy	jaycee_: Is that from The Witcher 2 bug reports? http://igetyourfail.blogspot.de/2008/03/bug-fix-stupid-error.html ;)

2014-11-04 04:37:03	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, ive seen some very similar ones :)
2014-11-04 04:37:19	jaycee_	DrMcCoy, such crash reports with insulting text on them have been deleted now
2014-11-04 04:37:37	@Samsai	people just need to become consistent with their case, not a hard thing to do
2014-11-04 04:37:47	jaycee_	and thats my policy, if you insult us or the company in the repro text, instant delete - i dont give a shit about your crash if youre abusive :)
2014-11-04 04:37:59	Raven67854	jaycee_, you do know that by blanketing anybody who disagree's with you as a Linux fanboy is just as bad as an actual Linux fanboy rright?
2014-11-04 04:38:11	jaycee_	Samsai, agreed, but it is no reason to break filename matching

2014-11-04 04:38:59	jaycee_	Raven67854, i am not the only one who thinks this though, there have been plenty of incidents where the linux community will viciously defend a quite obviously stupid design decision or feature of Linux when someone points it out
2014-11-04 04:39:05	Coolgeek	I just don't get it... does the OS have to correct the mistake of the dev ?
2014-11-04 04:39:13	Raven67854	jaycee_, you're just as volatile as them
2014-11-04 04:39:39	von	the thing is, the developers came to linux. an environment that has its legacies, and now you demand they change everything in your favor
2014-11-04 04:39:40	DrMcCoy	Samsai: Well, you could just crawl the whole directory tree on startup, throw it in a case insensitive map and wrap open/close to search the map
2014-11-04 04:39:44	jaycee_	Coolgeek, its not an error at all. it just shouldnt be an issue
2014-11-04 04:39:49	@Samsai	next we are probably going to blame programming languages and APIs for being case sensitive
2014-11-04 04:39:54	von	that is not going to happen overnight
2014-11-04 04:40:14	Raven67854	jaycee_, I mean my answer to that is why you're so lazy. I have to develop for annoying shitty fucking android/ios. but you don't seem me running around calling customers of those clients fanboys and being volatile to them.
2014-11-04 04:40:33	Coolgeek	when a dev use filename instead of fileName, it's an inconsistency of the dev, therefor, the OS have to say to the dev that he is wrong

2014-11-04 04:41:09	von	Coolgeek, I wonder, if there are any advantages to case sensitivity in file names?
2014-11-04 04:41:28	jaycee_	the best ones are the ones who consistently moan about windows, and nearly all of the moaning comes down to "it doesnt work like linux does"
2014-11-04 04:41:31	jaycee_	well duh
2014-11-04 04:41:55	jaycee_	von, it was faster.... when unix ran on a pdp
2014-11-04 04:42:10	Raven67854	It would be nice if linux had case insensative. It doesn't stop bitching about it and just deal with it. And slowly start to campaign to get it fixed. But if your only answer is to meet volatile people with volatile you'll never get anywhere.
2014-11-04 04:42:14	jaycee_	von, these days the extra processing power required for case insensitive matching at Unicode level is irrelevant
2014-11-04 04:42:30	Raven67854	jaycee_, Who cares what other people do! You're an employee of Virtual Programming... Your actions on/off the clock matter.
2014-11-04 04:42:40	Coolgeek	von: maybe. it depend on how people sees it. but definitely, if you name a file "test", you don't have to refer at it like "Test". that way you don'tfollow your own standard nad become lazy
2014-11-04 04:42:57	Coolgeek	that just lead to bug / security issue / ...
2014-11-04 04:43:33	von	Coolgeek, more often than not it results in filenames being lowercase
2014-11-04 04:43:44	Raven67854	You've been coming in here for several months now. And all you do is complain about how Linux isn't like Windows/Mac(ironic considering what you think of Linux people). Why would anybody want to buy something you ported with the way you hate Linux people all the time
2014-11-04 04:44:18	jaycee_	see this is it, i dont "hate" linux, i hate a good portion of the community around it who are more like religious devouts than user's of a platform
2014-11-04 04:44:35	Coolgeek	I just don't get it why you refer as a file as "Test" instead of "test" if you called it "test" in the first place
2014-11-04 04:44:36	Raven67854	jaycee_, That is not how you've been acting... And you do the same thing as those fanboys
2014-11-04 04:44:44	jaycee_	you cannot give any useful feedback on things that should be done to improve linux without getting attacked
2014-11-04 04:44:59	von	Coolgeek, because it is irrelevant in the environment you work in
2014-11-04 04:45:04	Raven67854	Agreed but you blanket anybody who says anything to unless it's sucking up as Linux fanboyism.
2014-11-04 04:45:06	von	you get used to that
2014-11-04 04:45:09	jaycee_	i mentioned for example, how linux's threading scheduler could do with improvement, implementing PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
2014-11-04 04:45:14	jaycee_	i did this in public
2014-11-04 04:45:21	jaycee_	i got "stop writing shitty windows code" in response
2014-11-04 04:45:39	jaycee_	Con Kolivas tried to improve the scheduler in such a manner. He gave up as his work consistently got rejected
2014-11-04 04:45:55	Coolgeek	because the environnement permit you to do that. that way, you become lazy, and make some bad coding
2014-11-04 04:46:06	Coolgeek	leading to poor applications
2014-11-04 04:46:14	jaycee_	Coolgeek, filenames not being case sensitive is not "bad coding" at all, wtf
2014-11-04 04:46:25	jaycee_	its a FILENAME
2014-11-04 04:46:31	jaycee_	it ends up as a lookup to an inode number
2014-11-04 04:46:40	jaycee_	who cares how it matches as long as it's consistent
2014-11-04 04:47:04	jaycee_	you do not name file names that are textually identical but differing in case, in the same dir, to be treated individually. noone would store files like that
2014-11-04 04:47:12	jaycee_	noone would have README and ReadMe in the same dir
2014-11-04 04:47:20	von	^ that
2014-11-04 04:47:42	jaycee_	preserve case, yes, but do not make it a matching criteria
2014-11-04 04:47:46	von	my initial reaction to case sensitivity argument was "wtf, it's how it is, not broken => no need to fix!"
2014-11-04 04:48:02	von	but then I thought about how often I see or use filenames that differ only in case
2014-11-04 04:48:20	von	the answer was never, because it is extremely confusing
2014-11-04 04:49:02	jaycee_	os x gives you case sensitive hfs+ as a choice. hardly anyone uses it. most of the people ive come across using it, chose it at install time by accident, and wish they hadnt
2014-11-04 04:49:07	jaycee_	but dont want to reformat
2014-11-04 04:49:33	jaycee_	when they get something that doesnt work, they usually just create a dmg formatted as regular hfs+, mount it, and install whatever it is there
2014-11-04 04:52:11	jaycee_	i would be happy if linux started with the possibility for case insensitivity, currently i am told that filename matching is in the kernel, not in the fs, so it is case sensitive always
2014-11-04 04:52:16	jaycee_	FUSE bodges it somehow
2014-11-04 04:52:34	jaycee_	at least make it available at format time for ext5 or whatever
2014-11-04 04:53:17	jaycee_	it wouldnt even be that hard to add i dont think, its just a feature bit in the filesystem's superblock, and the appropriate code in kernel
2014-11-04 04:53:42	jaycee_	its the "we are Linux and we will not be moved!" attitude that really annoys me
2014-11-04 04:54:21	jaycee_	as an OS linux has loads of potential but stupid standpoints and obstinate decisions like this ruin things
2014-11-04 04:56:58	von	case insensitivity works in jfs
2014-11-04 04:57:29	von	just tested it, jfs_mkfs -O and you can access files case insensitively
2014-11-04 04:58:29	von	kernel related it may be, but it depends on the support of specific fs in kernel if I understand it correctly
2014-11-04 04:58:31	jaycee_	hm interesting, i was told by some guys who work in kernel dev that the case sensitivity on filename matching was enforced by the kernel, not the filesystem block

2014-11-04 04:59:47	jaycee_	now, enforcing filesystem names and paths being utf8 would be a good addition, rather than just "whatever the system encoding happens to be set to"
2014-11-04 05:00:40	von	dunno
2014-11-04 05:00:52	von	imo, if you use something besides UTF8 in your system, it's your problem
2014-11-04 05:00:54	jaycee_	its always better to have guaranteed encoding
2014-11-04 05:01:19	jaycee_	von, yep, but users who have set it to something else dont see it that way
2014-11-04 05:01:36	jaycee_	just "your software is broken" usually quickly followed by "if you were open source..."
2014-11-04 05:02:12	Raven67854	Yeah it's awful that people like open source...
2014-11-04 05:02:20	von	lol
2014-11-04 05:02:30	Raven67854	Those annoying bloody bastards
2014-11-04 05:02:31	jaycee_	no, its awful that people see it as the solution to every little problem
2014-11-04 05:02:56	Raven67854	Try having an OS you've used for years and that's the only software you really have access to
2014-11-04 05:02:59	jaycee_	open source is great but it is not a solution to making software that interoperates correctly
2014-11-04 05:03:40	Raven67854	Eh
2014-11-04 05:03:54	Raven67854	I've seen a lot of great open source and closed products.. And a lot of awful of both.
2014-11-04 05:04:51	jaycee_	i didnt say open source vs closed source. i said open source is not a solution to making everything work
2014-11-04 05:05:25	jaycee_	ive never liked how open source OS's use a build environment as an install tool. package managers have gone a long way in helping that die off, but it still happens
2014-11-04 05:06:35	@Samsai	build tools are an excellent way of installing software that was just git commited
2014-11-04 05:06:58	jaycee_	Samsai, yes for bleeding edge stuff OK, but not for general use
2014-11-04 05:07:15	@Samsai	most of the general use apps are available as packages
2014-11-04 05:07:26	@Samsai	you only really build stuff when you need the latest and greatest
2014-11-04 05:08:35	jaycee_	its still the only way to solve certain distro issues too though
2014-11-04 05:08:36	Coolgeek	or if your distro doesn't provide the package
2014-11-04 05:09:11	jaycee_	when i shipped airline tycoon for example, a long time ago admittedly, i frequently ran across distro's that were just shipping broken libs, or libs compiled differently that stopped the game working
2014-11-04 05:09:25	jaycee_	(cue lots of "you should open source the game and then this wouldnt be a problem" emails)
2014-11-04 05:09:47	jaycee_	SDL1 was actually the biggest problem
2014-11-04 05:09:54	jaycee_	several distro's shipped it broken in some way
2014-11-04 05:10:08	jaycee_	the fix was always to uninstall the distro SDL package, and configure && make && make install it

2014-11-04 05:11:21	jaycee_	fedora/redhat had broken YUV
2014-11-04 05:11:28	Raven67854	Again sounds like a lazy packaging work from a distro maintainer
2014-11-04 05:11:41	jaycee_	some shipped with no oss/alsa but rather something like ESD only
2014-11-04 05:11:56	Raven67854	Good old debian
2014-11-04 05:12:08	jaycee_	i remember one shipping sdl_mixer with something that choked on the .ogg files i had encoded for the game
2014-11-04 05:12:16	jaycee_	debian and ubuntu worked out of the box
2014-11-04 05:12:44	jaycee_	in the end someone just took the .so's from Ubuntu and rolled them into a package to drop into the game dir
2014-11-04 05:13:01	jaycee_	linux games faq used to have the details, but it seems to have disappeared :)

2014-11-04 07:53:12	jaycee_	nvidia just write better drivers
2014-11-04 07:53:44	liamdawe	php does my head in
2014-11-04 07:53:52	liamdawe	just to throw that out there
2014-11-04 07:53:54	liamdawe	i hate numbers
2014-11-04 07:54:26	DrMcCoy	php is a messy hodge-podge
2014-11-04 07:54:42	Morgawr	php is hilariously bad
2014-11-04 07:55:15	liamdawe	trying to calculate what page a comment is on
2014-11-04 07:55:23	liamdawe	have it mostly working
2014-11-04 07:55:40	liamdawe	apart from this one random comment which shows on my link as the page before it is on
2014-11-04 07:55:42	liamdawe	grrr
2014-11-04 07:55:43	jaycee_	youll want trucate not round up
2014-11-04 07:56:29	liamdawe	hmmm oh rly
2014-11-04 07:56:34	jaycee_	i think ;)
2014-11-04 07:56:47	jaycee_	i dont like php much either, but i prefer it to all the other "web" languages
2014-11-04 07:57:02	liamdawe	hmmm nope thats wrong too :P
2014-11-04 07:57:09	jaycee_	im tempted to learn lua and start doing stuff with lua
2014-11-04 08:00:07	liamdawe	bah fixed what i was doing
2014-11-04 08:00:28	liamdawe	it helps when calculating what page a comment is on when counting the comments to include the comment you want, not exclude it <_<
2014-11-04 08:01:20	jaycee_	id have thought commentpage = commentnum / commentsperpage tbh :)
2014-11-04 08:01:55	liamdawe	yeah it is, but i wasn't counting the commented wanted, only the ones before it, oops
2014-11-04 08:02:06	liamdawe	comment wanted*
2014-11-04 08:03:49	Happy-Ferret	Python + server side JS FTW!
2014-11-04 08:05:11	von	lua is cute
2014-11-04 08:11:40	Morgawr	server side JS is like shooting yourself in the face, imo
2014-11-04 08:11:52	Morgawr	as opposed to the foot with any other server-side language :P
2014-11-04 08:12:13	millan	JAVA JAVA JAVA... I will show myself the door
2014-11-04 08:12:19	Happy-Ferret	Sure. Shooting yourself in the face with candy bullets of awesomness.
2014-11-04 08:12:26	Morgawr	Happy-Ferret: and diabetes
2014-11-04 08:13:15	Happy-Ferret	JAVA? You mean that monstrositity that looks like it was written by a mad Microsoft engineer?
2014-11-04 08:15:37	Morgawr	well, Microsoft did make C# which is an objectively better (language-wise) version of Java :P

2014-11-04 08:18:40	DrMcCoy	Just use C for server side "scripts" ;)
2014-11-04 08:19:56	Morgawr	then pipe them with cgi-bin and use envvars as parameters
2014-11-04 08:20:05	Morgawr	what could possibly go wrong
2014-11-04 08:20:28	DrMcCoy	Everything uses environment variables
2014-11-04 08:21:26	Happy-Ferret	Morgawr, I know. I wish C# was an Oracle product and Java was made by Microsoft. Would make much more sense.
2014-11-04 08:21:40	DrMcCoy	Both are carp
2014-11-04 08:22:26	mirv_	DrMcCoy, that's why it all smells so fishy!
2014-11-04 08:22:32	Happy-Ferret	Difference being that C# is bearable while JAVA has the potential of turning you into Abdul Alhazred, the mad Arab ^^
2014-11-04 08:22:48	mirv_	(my apologies, couldn't resist the pun)
2014-11-04 08:22:53	DrMcCoy	:)
2014-11-04 08:23:24	Happy-Ferret	Developing in JAVA reminds me of doing homework, for some reason.
2014-11-04 08:23:57	Morgawr	I found my peace of mind with Java after I started using Clojure
2014-11-04 08:24:00	Morgawr	much more sensible to me
2014-11-04 08:24:09	Morgawr	still have to deal with the JVM but it isn't that bad by itself
2014-11-04 08:25:06	Happy-Ferret	I tried using Jython once. But setting it up is almost as mindnumbing as JAVA itself.
2014-11-04 08:25:53	Happy-Ferret	Truth be told, that was on a Windows machine at work. So that might have been the real issue, instead of Jython itself.

2014-11-05 02:12:44	alien2003	Arthur_D: thx, what model should I buy. I have R7 250 and it has a major problem with some games. I think it's because of bad drivers. In many games when I turn the camera FPS decreases and it freezes. Unturned, Insurgency, CoD MW2. MW2 is playable with good FPS but on some maps when you look onto the light FPS decreases and it freezes
2014-11-05 02:12:55	alien2003	what model would you suggest?
2014-11-05 02:13:13	Arthur_D	no idea, I don't use AMD cards, mostly
2014-11-05 02:13:31	Arthur_D	but Wine will always be hit and miss
2014-11-05 02:13:50	Beamboom	So will open source drivers be, afaik
2014-11-05 02:14:23	alien2003	Arthur_D: when I used proprietary NVIDIA FPS didn't decrease
2014-11-05 02:14:44	Arthur_D	that's what I use too
2014-11-05 02:17:35	alien2003	Even Terraria is slow on my ATI card :(
2014-11-05 02:17:43	alien2003	so I want to buy a new one
2014-11-05 02:18:58	mirv_	if you want stable open source drivers, up to Northern Islands cards are probably your best bet
2014-11-05 02:19:12	mirv_	radeonsi isn't as far developed as r600g
2014-11-05 02:20:04	mirv_	no matter what you use, always get the latest kernel, and the latest Mesa

2014-11-05 02:20:37	alien2003	mirv_: thx. What models are NI?
2014-11-05 02:21:33	mirv_	rule of thumb is up to the HD6xxx series
2014-11-05 02:21:37	tadzik	woot
2014-11-05 02:22:07	mirv_	the HD74xx to HD76xx are also included
2014-11-05 02:22:24	mirv_	but HD77xx and above are Southern Islands
2014-11-05 02:22:25	alien2003	mirv_: is HD6870 OK?
2014-11-05 02:22:44	alien2003	mirv_: for foss drivers gaming with wine
2014-11-05 02:23:24	mirv_	I don't game with wine, but for historical reasons it's very likely that wine will still work better with nvidia blobs
2014-11-05 02:24:17	tadzik	alien2003: why do you want to play closed source games with open source drivers?
2014-11-05 02:24:24	jaycee_	my advice is if you really want to game, drop the idealism, get an nvidia card, use nvidias binary driver
2014-11-05 02:24:28	tadzik	I mean, I'm trying to understand your underlying motivation for tormenting yourself like that
2014-11-05 02:24:29	jaycee_	because anything else is slow
2014-11-05 02:24:48	alien2003	tadzik: because I don't use my computer only for games
2014-11-05 02:24:48	tadzik	lol
2014-11-05 02:24:56	jaycee_	unless you buy an older AMD card
2014-11-05 02:25:29	tadzik	alien2003: what does that have to do with anything?
2014-11-05 02:25:47	alien2003	tadzik: I'm paranoid
2014-11-05 02:26:01	jaycee_	nvidias drivers work fine normally. it is only people who run bleeding edge kernels that tend to have issues
2014-11-05 02:26:02	Arthur_D	I do agree, using open source drivers for closed games doesn't make sense unless you only want better desktop integration
2014-11-05 02:26:14	von	O_o
2014-11-05 02:26:28	tadzik	alien2003: you should really rethink your strategy here
2014-11-05 02:26:28	jaycee_	i only see one reason to use an open source driver - idealism
2014-11-05 02:26:34	tadzik	you want to play Closed Soure Gaems
2014-11-05 02:26:44	tadzik	made by companies with largely questionable practices
2014-11-05 02:26:48	jaycee_	closed or open source games doesnt matter, its simply performance
2014-11-05 02:26:56	jaycee_	tadzik, thats life...
2014-11-05 02:26:58	tadzik	but you insist on open source drivers?
2014-11-05 02:27:05	tadzik	are you running coreboot too?
2014-11-05 02:27:08	Arthur_D	if it's about performance, use NVIDIA blob
2014-11-05 02:27:22	mirv_	I prefer open source drivers because they track better with kernel & X updates
2014-11-05 02:27:32	alien2003	tadzik: nope. I don't use coreboot
2014-11-05 02:27:36	jaycee_	mirv_, like i said, if you want to run bleeding edge stuff ;)
2014-11-05 02:27:45	tadzik	what if your bios records child porn

2014-11-05 02:28:21	alien2003	tadzik: my motherbord's vendor doesn't exist anymore. I don't think they can track me
2014-11-05 02:28:23	jaycee_	mirv_, hehe.. though i must admit, the sooner AMD drop catalyst the better, or at least make something that *works*
2014-11-05 02:28:39	jaycee_	dude, stop listening to stallman
2014-11-05 02:28:42	jaycee_	noones tracking you
2014-11-05 02:28:56	tadzik	jaycee_++
2014-11-05 02:29:00	Arthur_D	except on the internet ;)
2014-11-05 02:29:21	jaycee_	only people tracking you on the internet are google so they can shove more ad shit at you :)
2014-11-05 02:29:33	alien2003	jaycee_: I don't use google
2014-11-05 02:29:45	mirv_	jaycee_, yeah, I'm really hoping this new driver idea of theirs works out
2014-11-05 02:29:53	jaycee_	not directly, but you can guarantee at least one site you use is
2014-11-05 02:30:07	tadzik	well, you can certainly avoid google
2014-11-05 02:30:09	tadzik	(I do)
2014-11-05 02:30:18	jaycee_	mirv_, yeah me too, catalyst is just getting silly.. they should rethink and use the same approach nvidia do - share as much driver code between windows and linux as they can
2014-11-05 02:30:22	alien2003	Duckduckgo, startpage, unbubble, lxquick
2014-11-05 02:30:54	mirv_	jaycee_, I'm pretty sure they try, but I'm also pretty sure they need to rip a lot of it apart and fix it properly to do that better
2014-11-05 02:31:16	alien2003	anybody tried to disassemble NVIDIA driver? Is it safe to use it?
2014-11-05 02:31:17	mirv_	and that's just not worth it now - better to have a clean start

2014-11-05 02:32:38	mirv_	jaycee_, because apple is...uh..hmm....apple
2014-11-05 02:33:06	mirv_	apple don't like anyone other than apple creating software
2014-11-05 02:34:38	mirv_	alien2003, do you own a mobile phone?
2014-11-05 02:34:48	alien2003	mirv_: yes I do
2014-11-05 02:34:58	tadzik	booo!
2014-11-05 02:35:00	mirv_	right, then don't worry about people tracking you via a computer
2014-11-05 02:35:01	tadzik	stallman is not proud of you
2014-11-05 02:35:09	jaycee_	mirv_, apple have a lot wrong gpu wise anyway. mobile gpu's, underclocked, and lousy thermal design
2014-11-05 02:35:13	tadzik	coming up next: "but it's cyanogen"
2014-11-05 02:35:59	alien2003	no. I don't like Android. It's Maemo 5
2014-11-05 02:36:12	tadzik	ah, good thing n900 doesn't have binary blobs all around
2014-11-05 02:36:14	tadzik	like in pulseaudio
2014-11-05 02:36:41	alien2003	It has a lot of binary blobs but I don't see any alternatives
2014-11-05 02:37:21	jaycee_	doesnt matter what your phone runs anyway, if someone wants to track you and they can read cell towers
2014-11-05 02:37:25	tadzik	but there are some
2014-11-05 02:37:30	jaycee_	your phone has a unique imei, and you can find that
2014-11-05 02:37:36	mirv_	jaycee_, yeah I've heard bad things about apple gpus
2014-11-05 02:37:38	tadzik	you just choose convenience over paranoia sometimes, like we all do
2014-11-05 02:38:13	mirv_	extreme paranoia would be to not avoid those services, but to actually use them a little so that you blend into the crowd, as it were
2014-11-05 02:39:29	alien2003	so is it better to buy Nvidia and use proprietary blob?
2014-11-05 02:39:40	jaycee_	if you want to game, yes
2014-11-05 02:39:58	mirv_	open source does not automatically mean secure - just look at the heartbleed thing
2014-11-05 02:40:00	tadzik	especially on linux
2014-11-05 02:40:20	alien2003	jaycee_: and no way to play with FOSS drivers?
2014-11-05 02:40:46	tadzik	you could, but why would you do that on purpose
2014-11-05 02:40:48	--	sobkas[away] is now known as sobkas
2014-11-05 02:40:49	jaycee_	not really, very limited range of AMD cards run well with the r600 mesa driver
2014-11-05 02:40:57	tadzik	it's a fucking pain in the ass
2014-11-05 02:41:02	tadzik	ask anybody running them
2014-11-05 02:41:16	mirv_	....
2014-11-05 02:41:29	mirv_	well, I don't have that many problems with them
2014-11-05 02:41:33	jaycee_	we got a lot of grief about "not supporting open source drivers" with witcher 2, but the reason we dont is simple - theyre not good enough
2014-11-05 02:41:40	jaycee_	mirv_, yep but you dont have an R7 or R9 :)
2014-11-05 02:41:52	mirv_	jaycee_, that's true, but I do run a kaveri on a second box
2014-11-05 02:42:11	jaycee_	theyre not exactly great either :)
2014-11-05 02:42:22	mirv_	while open source drivers work, performance isn't on par with fglrx
2014-11-05 02:42:40	jaycee_	yeah im impressed you got a build of r600 to run witcher2
2014-11-05 02:42:41	mirv_	and the hardware itself isn't what I'd call oozing with gaming power
2014-11-05 02:42:56	Coolgeek	my thought is : game : nvidia + proprietary. not gaming : intel
2014-11-05 02:43:17	tadzik	agreed 100%
2014-11-05 02:43:18	jaycee_	yeah intels fine for a desktop, but shite for anything else
2014-11-05 02:43:19	mirv_	jaycee_, I still get some shader artefacts sometimes
2014-11-05 02:43:29	mirv_	must get a screenshot when it appears next
2014-11-05 02:43:54	jaycee_	mirv_, ok, but ive not seen anything on fglrx or nvidia, so i'd have to assume its a bug in mesa
2014-11-05 02:44:02	mirv_	purely for interest, I don't expect anyone to really care
2014-11-05 02:44:14	mirv_	jaycee_, yeah, very likely
2014-11-05 02:44:15	tadzik	:P
2014-11-05 02:44:40	jaycee_	i wonder how likely the mesa people are to look at the game and do anything about it
2014-11-05 02:44:51	jaycee_	or whether theyll pull the "its closed source, so we cant help" line
2014-11-05 02:45:10	mirv_	they'd want the shader source in question
2014-11-05 02:45:12	tadzik	yeah jaycee_, why won't you guys opensource it
2014-11-05 02:45:14	jaycee_	if any mesa devs want to get in touch with us we can see about sorting out a copy of the game for testing use
2014-11-05 02:45:14	tadzik	:P
2014-11-05 02:45:16	mirv_	of that I'm sure
2014-11-05 02:45:35	jaycee_	im certainly happy to talk to CDPR or GOG about it
2014-11-05 02:45:41	Arthur_D	anecdotally, I experience a bug using the NVIDIA blob with an open source game... and the dev says it's a driver bug, which it very well might be, so it's not always roses either
2014-11-05 02:45:59	mirv_	jaycee_, possibly ask in #radeon
2014-11-05 02:46:10	jaycee_	Arthur_D, sometimes it is, though i'd wonder what his rationale is for it, what he's compared it to
2014-11-05 02:46:27	Arthur_D	a newer NVIDIA card, I think
2014-11-05 02:46:33	Arthur_D	I have a pretty old one

2014-11-05 03:48:34	jaycee_	unreasonable paranoia started by that idiot stallman
2014-11-05 03:48:58	jaycee_	who on earth listens to a guy who eats his own toe cheese
2014-11-05 03:49:43	Coolgeek	do you run a free bios alien2003 ?
2014-11-05 03:49:51	alien2003	Coolgeek: no :(
2014-11-05 03:50:26	alien2003	jaycee_: Stallman is not an idiot just because of Emacs :3
2014-11-05 03:51:17	jaycee_	stallman didnt invent emacs
2014-11-05 03:52:29	alien2003	jaycee_: what about me I like his idea about "0-3 freedoms"
2014-11-05 03:54:08	jaycee_	i dunno, i dont read anything he spouts about
2014-11-05 03:55:19	jaycee_	i will be glad when clang and lldb finally mean an end to the bag of shite he started
2014-11-05 03:57:05	jaycee_	im sure theres going to be plenty of propaganda about clang too because apple are funding it
2014-11-05 03:59:52	mirv_	there's entirely closed off source on one end of the scale, then there's enforced open source on the other
2014-11-05 04:00:12	jaycee_	yep. ive never ever liked gpl
2014-11-05 04:00:15	mirv_	so long as there's one, we need its opposite
2014-11-05 04:00:23	jaycee_	bsd and similar licenses are what i think true open source is
2014-11-05 04:00:28	mirv_	but there's an awful lot of middle ground we need in there too
2014-11-05 04:01:31	mirv_	I don't mind the GPL, but I also don't see it as covering every situation
2014-11-05 04:02:01	jaycee_	gplv3 shows stallmans true intentions for gpl, he just missed some things to start with
2014-11-05 04:04:21	mirv_	again though, I don't mind it - but then I'm aware of what it is, what it means, etc
2014-11-05 04:04:43	mirv_	and it's not like there aren't other options

2014-11-05 04:15:34	jaycee_	didnt say there was, i dont like it personally but ...
2014-11-05 04:15:37	jaycee_	just stallman didnt invent it
2014-11-05 04:15:44	jaycee_	common misconception that he did
2014-11-05 04:15:44	flesk_	Oh, ok.
2014-11-05 04:16:21	jaycee_	i guess my experience of using memacs on the amiga forever tainted me against it :)
2014-11-05 04:16:49	flesk_	I didn't know about that. Though I see that the Wikipedia article mentions it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs
2014-11-05 04:16:49	GolliumBot	[ Emacs - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
2014-11-05 04:17:05	flesk_	"The original EMACS was written in 1976 by Richard Stallman and Guy L. Steele, Jr. as a set of Editor MACroS for the TECO editor."
2014-11-05 04:17:34	jaycee_	go further in the article and youll see he based it off something else
2014-11-05 04:18:35	flesk_	"GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten."
2014-11-05 04:21:22	flesk_	I didn't know any of that from before though, even though I've used Emacs on and off for about 10 years.
2014-11-05 04:24:21	jaycee_	and i havent forgiven him for gdb either
2014-11-05 04:24:38	jaycee_	aka, how to keep debugging in the 80s forever
2014-11-05 04:27:55	lemon_snowCone	ah gdb
2014-11-05 04:28:04	lemon_snowCone	eye bleed central
2014-11-05 04:28:11	lemon_snowCone	ddd is marginally better
2014-11-05 04:28:16	jaycee_	no doubt its flexible, but it is a complete pain in the arse to use

2014-11-05 05:55:17	liamdawe	i hate it when steam changes their api
2014-11-05 05:55:46	liamdawe	for some reason our steam sales import/expiry is broken, and i've narrowed it down, and it's annoying me
2014-11-05 05:56:45	liamdawe	basically, this works http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=227580
2014-11-05 05:57:08	liamdawe	but to not have to do a new request for every game we used to to add each id into it like this
2014-11-05 05:57:19	liamdawe	http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=227580,anotherid,anotherid,anotherid
2014-11-05 05:57:28	liamdawe	now it seems to only accept one at a time

2014-11-05 05:59:19	jaycee_	probably because , isnt legal
2014-11-05 06:00:12	liamdawe	we wouldn't even have to do it if they let us filter by supported os
2014-11-05 06:00:16	liamdawe	but they don't
2014-11-05 06:01:13	jaycee_	what did it do before, return a json array instead ?
2014-11-05 06:01:33	Half-Shot	Still does return a json object
2014-11-05 06:01:42	Half-Shot	Which is wierd, as you would guess that means multiples still wrok
2014-11-05 06:01:53	liamdawe	it returns null if you put in one than one id now
2014-11-05 06:02:00	liamdawe	more than one*
2014-11-05 06:02:22	liamdawe	means our import/expiry needs re-writing <_<
2014-11-05 06:02:23	jaycee_	Half-Shot, nah, for returning multiple elements as theyre formatted it would be more sensible to return an array of the objects
2014-11-05 06:02:36	Half-Shot	Not if you want to filter by id
2014-11-05 06:03:13	jaycee_	my guess would be they saw a DoS potential in allowing specifying more than one app.. you could specify a crapload and consume a lot of time per request
2014-11-05 06:03:26	jaycee_	whereas they probably have sensible request rate limiting
2014-11-05 06:03:26	liamdawe	well yeah it did take a fuck load of time
2014-11-05 06:03:34	Half-Shot	You *used* to be able to leave it blank and the whole thing just took ages
2014-11-05 06:03:46	jaycee_	yeah, definite DoS potential then
2014-11-05 06:03:51	liamdawe	not sure how i can re-write our script to do it once at a time <_<
2014-11-05 06:04:14	Half-Shot	Well, your gonna have to cache it a lot.
2014-11-05 06:04:30	jaycee_	not knowing your script i couldnt say, but it doesnt seem too hard to make it one request at a time. and yeah, definitely make use of cache-control
2014-11-05 06:04:35	liamdawe	Half-Shot: what do you mean?
2014-11-05 06:04:40	jaycee_	assuming they respect that header
2014-11-05 06:04:55	Half-Shot	Your gonna have to send a request for each game, which each takes about 0.2 seconds max.

2014-11-05 06:06:00	jaycee_	yeah will help if they have support for eg Last-Modified
2014-11-05 06:06:01	liamdawe	cache what though?
2014-11-05 06:06:34	jaycee_	liamdawe, your last queries of each game youre interested in
2014-11-05 06:06:40	Half-Shot	^
2014-11-05 06:06:51	jaycee_	youd keep a copy of the last query, and when you fetched it
2014-11-05 06:07:11	jaycee_	then when you make your next request, youd set Last-Modified to the last time you fetched it
2014-11-05 06:07:25	jaycee_	if the api has caching it'll return Not Modified if it didnt change since you last asked - hopefully, quickly
2014-11-05 06:07:33	Half-Shot	That's true.
2014-11-05 06:07:37	jaycee_	youd probably want to use a persistent http connection too
2014-11-05 06:07:47	jaycee_	though i think php likely does that anyway
2014-11-05 06:07:52	liamdawe	yeah mean when i query each app to check the header, if it wasn't modified, then don't query it?
2014-11-05 06:08:19	Half-Shot	I belive its done valve serverside?
2014-11-05 06:08:29	liamdawe	yeah mean when i query each app to check the header, if it wasn't modified, then don't query it?
2014-11-05 06:08:33	liamdawe	ops
2014-11-05 06:08:40	jaycee_	well no, the server would either see that it didnt change anything since you last asked, and return 204 not modified, or it would see that things changed and return 200 OK with new data
2014-11-05 06:08:48	Half-Shot	Ahh
2014-11-05 06:08:49	liamdawe	i need to get it to do it one at a time first before i look at anything like that
2014-11-05 06:09:03	jaycee_	i am guessin here, i have no idea if the api supports caching like that
2014-11-05 06:09:11	jaycee_	hopefully it does
2014-11-05 06:10:05	liamdawe	problem is, with something like this unless you keep going through it, you come back to it months later and go "ok i have no fucking idea what this code does"
2014-11-05 06:10:11	Half-Shot	Not here :/
2014-11-05 06:10:17	Half-Shot	I'm getting 200s every time
2014-11-05 06:10:27	jaycee_	Half-Shot, ugh :/
2014-11-05 06:10:55	liamdawe	i wonder if they just changed the way you seperate each appid maybe?
2014-11-05 06:11:07	Half-Shot	I tried every type i knew liamdawe , nothing worked.
2014-11-05 06:11:40	liamdawe	damn they must have simply removed more than one id working
2014-11-05 06:11:53	jaycee_	im just wondering if there is any way to find out when the content last changed
2014-11-05 06:12:21	Half-Shot	Well apart from storing it yourself, i'm not sure.
2014-11-05 06:12:40	Half-Shot	And essentially getting it at 10 minute intervals or so.

2014-11-05 06:58:32	jaycee_	i have a suspicion your script must be making a new connection for each request
2014-11-05 06:59:26	liamdawe	jaycee_: pretty sure it is
2014-11-05 06:59:42	liamdawe	it's just doing a file_get_contents on the url each time
2014-11-05 06:59:45	jaycee_	yeah, if you can get it to do a persistent tcp connection that should speed it right up
2014-11-05 06:59:57	liamdawe	how?
2014-11-05 07:01:03	jaycee_	well file_get_contents probably wont do it, you'll probably need to use either the HTTP module or the CURL one
2014-11-05 07:02:40	jaycee_	hm stream contexts might help
2014-11-05 07:03:42	jaycee_	hm actually a post on php.net suggests stuff trying to use keep_alive makes file_get_contents() slow because it waits for the socket to close. yeah, i think youre better off moving away from file_get_contents

2014-11-05 07:30:21	liamdawe	spoke to the steamdb guy, and they have to do it one at a time too
2014-11-05 07:30:31	liamdawe	so thats the only way to do it, just gotta find a fast way to do that with php
2014-11-05 07:32:26	liamdawe	Half-Shot: Piratelv any thougts or ideas?
2014-11-05 07:33:27	Half-Shot	Well you *could* write a simple python script to dump them all into a json file, run that every 5 minutes over cron. Read the json file from php.
2014-11-05 07:33:28	jaycee_	id say split it into two tasks - collecting the data, and processing it. for collection you could probably multiprocess it some how
2014-11-05 07:33:41	Half-Shot	Thats the fastest your gonna get imo.
2014-11-05 07:34:04	liamdawe	Half-Shot: hah i don't know python ^_^
2014-11-05 07:34:10	Half-Shot	And on what jaycee_ said, you can tell python to multithread it.
2014-11-05 07:34:27	Half-Shot	Is that a statement or are you asking me to do it :P
2014-11-05 07:34:31	Coolgeek	shell is fine too :p
2014-11-05 07:34:34	jaycee_	yeah with php youd have to spawn it say 4 times, and each one would have to collect a range of data
2014-11-05 07:34:50	jaycee_	Coolgeek, no shell would be slow, calling curl each time, no persistance
2014-11-05 07:35:05	jaycee_	i reckon thats probably where your bottleneck is at the moment
2014-11-05 07:35:08	Half-Shot	I'm just thinking I'm not sure PHP is ideal for this sort of collection.
2014-11-05 07:35:27	jaycee_	Half-Shot, yeah it'll work, just not with file_get_contents() as it's not controllable enough
2014-11-05 07:35:33	liamdawe	yeah it's starting to look that way, wouldn't be a problem if valve just offered up a normal API like...every other store
2014-11-05 07:36:04	jaycee_	they do, they just dont have  the filtering options you want
2014-11-05 07:36:16	jaycee_	and one app per request is quite reasonable to prevent abuse
2014-11-05 07:36:44	liamdawe	jaycee_: every other store has a full xml for their store that have games on sale
2014-11-05 07:37:16	liamdawe	i don't really want to drop our steam sales feed, but i just can't do this myself, id ideally want it php so i can at least read and understand it :(
2014-11-05 07:37:31	jaycee_	ugh xml, theres a buttload of time parsing it right there
2014-11-05 07:38:05	liamdawe	jaycee_: no it's really fast, as the other stores only put games on sale into their feed, as it's a sales feed
2014-11-05 07:38:11	liamdawe	so they are usually small and fast
2014-11-05 07:38:22	liamdawe	valve has an overall api yes, but not easily sortabler
2014-11-05 07:38:31	liamdawe	all the sorting you have to do your end
2014-11-05 07:38:43	jaycee_	you could request it :)
2014-11-05 07:38:50	liamdawe	i could, but it would fall on deaf ears
2014-11-05 07:38:59	jaycee_	why dyou think that?
2014-11-05 07:39:07	liamdawe	GOL is small and it's not a usual request
2014-11-05 07:39:31	jaycee_	what, "steam games that are on sale" isnt a useful dataset to have?
2014-11-05 07:40:01	jaycee_	sure, you want linux, but thats simply a platform filter. what you really want is to just ask an api "give me a list of all games currently on sale"
2014-11-05 07:40:09	liamdawe	jaycee_: well do you have a suggestion on where to request such a thing?
2014-11-05 07:41:07	jaycee_	hm they do have a forum it seems but looks like you have to be a steamworks developer to get to it
2014-11-05 07:41:14	jaycee_	i'll see if i can find an email address or so

2014-11-05 08:51:04	sobkas	when you use selinux
2014-11-05 08:51:15	sobkas	you can do that
2014-11-05 08:51:34	jaycee_	selinux wont let you stop root getting access to anything
2014-11-05 08:52:24	Happy-Ferret	Damn. That's kind of a blow to my login idea.
2014-11-05 08:52:42	liamdawe	i really hate timezones
2014-11-05 08:52:58	sobkas	selinux is able to do that
2014-11-05 08:53:13	kkit	would disabling root logins be sufficient, Happy-Ferret?
2014-11-05 08:53:47	Happy-Ferret	Not really, since the first part of the login manager still requires root.
2014-11-05 08:54:40	kkit	disabling root logins doesn't disable root altogether
2014-11-05 08:54:53	jaycee_	well the idea is your process running as root only interacts with the bare minimum of things it has to
2014-11-05 08:55:05	jaycee_	everything else you do as a non privileged user
2014-11-05 08:55:30	Happy-Ferret	NVM. Disabling root login could actually work.
2014-11-05 08:55:49	jaycee_	see how sshd works for example. theres a root process accepting connections, but once youre connected and logged in, theres a child sshd running as the user you logged in as, running your shell
2014-11-05 08:58:21	@Samsai	i have to say, i'm a bit disappointed by transistor
2014-11-05 08:58:44	@Samsai	the gameplay is great, the game looks good but the story is oh so short
2014-11-05 08:59:35	Happy-Ferret	Well. My login manager is basically working like this. Root launches a user called loginuser. loginuser then runs the front- and backend of the login process. When another user is logged in, loginuser places a lock file inside a directory it has access to. While this lock file and the accompanying process are alive, no new graphical session can be executed.
2014-11-05 09:01:48	Happy-Ferret	Would've been nice to keep the lock file from being rmed. But then again, in doing so I'm essentially prohibiting fast user switching. So I guess I'll just get rid of the lock file concept.
2014-11-05 09:03:47	kkit	it sounds like you're trying to reinvent the wheel

2014-11-05 09:06:03	Happy-Ferret	Actually. I just realized something. Rather than not having the lock file and potentially allowing all sorts of X related nastiness, I could just create a lock file per logged in user. Hm.
2014-11-05 09:07:57	Happy-Ferret	If that cracks you up already, I better not tell you how I plan to create loginuser ^^

2014-11-05 09:26:21	kkit	are you really limiting direct access to root more than another login manager would?
2014-11-05 09:27:02	Happy-Ferret	root is still UID0 and it's the one launching loginuser (which in turn then starts the login manager). Without loginuser, root would directly launch the login manager frontend, making it easier to exploit. Of course, root still has control over loginuser (and thus the login manger frontend), but every little abstraction helps.

2014-11-05 09:30:36	Happy-Ferret	kkit: It's probably just different, not necessarily securer. But it could make simple, local exploits harder to achieve. Like dropping out of the login process and right into root (which I somehow, accidentally, managed on a text based login) or the stuff Windows users can do.
2014-11-05 09:30:59	sobkas	Happy-Ferret: write a spec for that
2014-11-05 09:32:41	Happy-Ferret	kkit: As for the language. I'm using a simple shell script + empty for the prototype backend. Possibly compiled Haskell (since that's what I'm using for several parts of my distro) for the final spec.  XUL for the frontend, as always.
2014-11-05 09:33:00	jaycee_	if you can get to root from a non privileged process, then that is a privilege elevation exploit, and should be fixed in whatever it was that allowed it
2014-11-05 09:36:42	Happy-Ferret	jaycee_: Will try to reproduce it. Only thing I know is that I killed one of the shells. It then dropped me back to the text based console login. I then tried logging in, made a typo and pressed backspace to fix it. Next thing I know, it drops me right into root. That "session" only lasted for 5 seconds but could be repeated over and over.
2014-11-05 09:38:12	kkit	Happy-Ferret, if you're concerned about local exploits, do you also have physical access blocked off?
2014-11-05 09:38:57	kkit	it's cool to learn something by reimplementing it yourself, but don't fool yourself into thinking it'll solve security issues :)
2014-11-05 09:39:21	jaycee_	you could probably disable local tty's running on the display
2014-11-05 09:39:34	jaycee_	so that that sort of thing can only be used from ssh or so
2014-11-05 09:39:49	jaycee_	hm but then i think x11 requires atty anyway
2014-11-05 09:39:50	Happy-Ferret	kkit: As I said, it's not about my particular device. But I wouldn't want to someday finish my distro only to realize the login process can be exploited in the same way Windows 7/8 users can create new users from their login manager.
2014-11-05 09:40:12	jaycee_	what?
2014-11-05 09:40:24	jaycee_	only if the user logged in is an administrative user
2014-11-05 09:40:33	jasonm	happy-ferret:  In grub edit the line, add init=/bin/sh
2014-11-05 09:40:42	jaycee_	or the machines already compromised to give someone NT SECURITY/System rights
2014-11-05 09:40:50	jasonm	if you're worried about a local user "hacking" the system, you're barking up the wrong tree
2014-11-05 09:41:38	jasonm	Give me physical access to a machine and I will hack it
2014-11-05 09:41:46	jasonm	it's not hard at that point
2014-11-05 09:41:59	liamdawe	does anyone here use our sales page?
2014-11-05 09:42:32	Happy-Ferret	jaycee: It's much easier. Since you already do have administrative rights during login on a Windows machine, it's as easy as replacing StickyKeys with the user management application.
2014-11-05 09:42:37	jasonm	I don't know what sales page you're talking about if that helps :(
2014-11-05 09:42:56	liamdawe	talking about http://www.gamingonlinux.com/sales/

2014-11-05 09:44:22	Happy-Ferret	I guess there are at least three people in my area running around with a computer like that, since I often never switched it back to the default StickyKeys functionality. Lol.
2014-11-05 09:44:40	sobkas	liamdawe: to many sales without a way to sort them by price or
2014-11-05 09:45:43	liamdawe	im thinking of either streamlining it or dropping it depending on how many people really use it, it got 1.5% of our taffic last month, and munt has no time for it now
2014-11-05 09:45:49	liamdawe	(munt maintains it)
2014-11-05 09:46:27	Happy-Ferret	Anyways. I'm probably overthinking this. Time to start with the actual front-end implementation.
2014-11-05 09:47:42	sobkas	liamdawe: If it gave me info about game without need to follow the link or better sort and filter games I would use it

2014-11-05 09:48:30	liamdawe	thoughts?
2014-11-05 09:48:47	liamdawe	i mean does anyone REALLY give a shit when it expires? to me i'm worried about the store and the price

2014-11-05 09:51:22	von	wasn't even aware that this page existed lol

2014-11-05 09:52:24	sobkas	liamdawe: if it pushed up deals that are going to expire soon while allowing to sort by other factors
2014-11-05 09:53:46	sobkas	liamdawe: or choose in settings that I want to see only deals from few shops for example: desura, steam and gog
2014-11-05 09:58:47	sobkas	when hoover over games name it shows a bobble with info about game, screenshot or video
2014-11-05 09:59:48	sobkas	when clicking on games name I'm taken to the store, it opens in a new tab or window
2014-11-05 10:00:47	liamdawe	is the pop-up an annoyance?
2014-11-05 10:02:37	sobkas	liamdawe: if you talk about pop-up that is right now, yes, it doesn't provide any info about game

2014-11-05 10:39:04	Happy-Ferret	Would be awesome if there was a way to implement such an add-on into World of Warcraft. My favourite Chinese restaurant would drown me in cash, free food and shares for such a thing. ^^
2014-11-05 10:39:57	Happy-Ferret	Seeing as how no one has come up with such an add-on yet, chances are the API either doesn't allow outside connections or Blizzard lawyered up.

2014-11-05 11:04:57	Happy-Ferret	NuSuey: Too bad Tweets are probably to short to effectively communicate a full fledged restaurant order (address included). Facebook might be a way.
2014-11-05 11:05:22	Happy-Ferret	Or hell, plain IRC.
2014-11-05 11:06:26	jaycee_	or anything you can talk to via http
2014-11-05 11:07:20	Happy-Ferret	It would probably require some sort of outside trickery, since WoW doesn't allow http or any outside connections.
2014-11-05 11:08:44	jaycee_	then how does it allow twitter or facebook?
2014-11-05 11:09:12	Happy-Ferret	Perhaps writing to a Lua file and having an outside daemon transferring the content of it would work. As far as I understand it, that's how Tweetcraft works.

2014-11-05 12:54:10	Happy-Ferret_	The plain WindowMaker interface + desktopless nautilus is actually a rather blissful experience. Unfortunately, GWorkspace.app is unbearable, at times. The filemanager is plain old (opens a new window for every folder) and it doesn't recognize a lot of non-Cocoa applications.
2014-11-05 12:58:55	Happy-Ferret_	If I can find a way to run a nautilus or thunar window without any decorations (just a plain Window with icons in it), I might eventually just apply some transparency to it and force it into the background layer. Should make for a better desktop than GWorkspace.

2014-11-06 01:16:36	flesk_	liamdawe: Not sure if the article I submitted now warrants a separate article or if it's better to just put in as an update in the last one?
2014-11-06 01:16:42	flesk_	It's mostly a copy-paste job.
2014-11-06 01:16:59	flesk_	Hi NuSuey.
2014-11-06 01:18:15	von	NuSuey, I hear the same question about games' linux support on steam
2014-11-06 01:18:30	von	if the 1.5% is worth it ;)
2014-11-06 01:18:47	NuSuey	haha.. true
2014-11-06 01:20:39	flesk_	Python is pretty neat. I used it all the time before but I abandoned it in favor of Perl.
2014-11-06 01:21:09	von	it's weird
2014-11-06 01:21:21	von	Python, I mean
2014-11-06 01:21:58	flesk_	Yeah, I don't think I could go back to it. Mostly because of the lack of brackets. I think it makes it look confusing now.
2014-11-06 01:22:56	NuSuey	when I encounter something I can't do in PHP anymore, I'll probably learn it >.<

2014-11-06 03:27:47	liamdawe	as for the 3ds, it's interesting for the games, but the 3d is a gimmick i don't like

2014-11-06 03:28:10	liamdawe	also ffs nintendo "wiiu" "new 3ds"

2014-11-06 03:30:25	liamdawe	i think 2ds/3ds is actually okay naming
2014-11-06 03:30:36	liamdawe	i was tempted by a 2ds
2014-11-06 03:30:42	liamdawe	as i don't like the 3d anyway
2014-11-06 03:31:20	liamdawe	i dont need one though, and i would probably never use it, so ill leave it heh

2014-11-06 03:44:48	Happy-Ferret	According to the info panel, TextEdit.app on GNUStep is the same one that came bundled with NEXTStep 4.0 in 1996. So old. Lol

2014-11-06 04:57:57	millan	I might write an article on it later
2014-11-06 04:58:02	millan	I am like, addicted to the game
2014-11-06 04:58:13	millan	and have vast majority of the vehicles unlocked
2014-11-06 04:58:19	millan	and spent way too much money on it
2014-11-06 04:58:47	liamdawe	do you actually need to spend money, or is it fun without fronting cash?
2014-11-06 05:00:36	millan	depends on your expectation, how much you enjoy the gameplay itself, and patience
2014-11-06 05:00:41	millan	I just made this comment on the page post
2014-11-06 05:00:52	millan	This is one of the least pay-2-win games out there, but it's rather pay-2-progress.
2014-11-06 05:00:52	millan	By that I mean you will grind your ass off if you don't throw some money at the game. As exclusive "money only" vehicles go, tho, they 90% of them are either light variations of what's already available for free (protypes, experimental modifications) (after grind tho) OR, a "captured" vehicle of one nation placed into another nation's tree.
2014-11-06 05:00:52	millan	IMHO you can have a lot of fun even for free, you just gonna have to deal with having quite limited options, unlocking a vehicle here and there. The game has a match-making system in place, tho, so most of the time your enemies shouldn't be significantly more powerful than you, so you always have a chance regardless.
2014-11-06 05:00:53	millan	Generally, 4 out of 5 situations, individual skill is significantly more important than the vehicles the players have, be it further-up-grind vehicle or a premium one.
2014-11-06 05:01:55	millan	for instance you start off with nothing but biplanes (ignoring tanks) but vast majority of what you gonna fight is other biplanes
2014-11-06 05:02:03	liamdawe	sounds like a great game then
2014-11-06 05:02:17	liamdawe	i was a little thrown off by the other mmo we got, can't remember the name now
2014-11-06 05:02:19	millan	it's still kinda a grindfest, mainly with tanks, planes are a bit better at that
2014-11-06 05:02:22	liamdawe	the spacey one
2014-11-06 05:02:46	millan	like, if you can't stand the feeling of having something better out of reach, it will make you bitter quickly
2014-11-06 05:03:01	millan	if you can enjoy playing whatever and see the extra unlocks as a bonus, you can have tons of fun
2014-11-06 05:03:06	millan	even for free
2014-11-06 05:03:21	millan	the spacey one is Star Conflict
2014-11-06 05:03:28	millan	and I myself was a bit disappointed in that
2014-11-06 05:03:53	liamdawe	ah yes that's it, the graphics and combat was good, but fuck everyones so good at it i get destroyed so quickly it removed the fun
2014-11-06 05:04:56	millan	the aircraft combat is a bit more straightforward and intuitive I think
2014-11-06 05:05:28	millan	also you have three difficulty modes - Arcade, Real Battles, and Simulator, and the gameplay differs a lot in all three
2014-11-06 05:05:41	liamdawe	ahhh <3 having different modes like that
2014-11-06 05:05:53	liamdawe	are those modes game dependant, or in your settings?
2014-11-06 05:06:11	millan	arcade is just swarmy mess with more forgiving flight models, in-air reloading, respawns, you spawn in midair
2014-11-06 05:06:47	millan	real battles you start on airfields in, there's no respawn, and flight models are trying to be realistic, also, ammo is limited and you have to land to rearm
2014-11-06 05:06:54	millan	both of these are best played with keyboard + mouse
2014-11-06 05:07:41	millan	then there's simulator which is like RB but removes enemy markers, and disables mouse control - mouse control is basically "point cursor at something, plane aims nose to it via autopilot"
2014-11-06 05:07:57	millan	you can play Simulator with virtual joystick and be semi successful but real joystick is preferable
2014-11-06 05:08:39	liamdawe	can you play with a gamepad?
2014-11-06 05:09:06	millan	I wouldn't recommend in any of the modes, but it should work in all three and in simulator, analog gamepad would be probably smidge better than mouse and keyboard
2014-11-06 05:09:22	millan	I heard some people saying it's good, tho
2014-11-06 05:09:23	liamdawe	i see thanks for all the info millan
2014-11-06 05:10:59	millan	no prob
2014-11-06 05:11:11	millan	again, I wouldn't get too hyped, it's not a game for everyone
2014-11-06 05:11:29	millan	it takes an odd kind of insanity and patience
2014-11-06 05:11:41	millan	being a fan of the vehicles greatly helps too
2014-11-06 05:11:51	millan	but I was never big into aircraft  until i tried
2014-11-06 05:11:59	millan	*until I tried it
2014-11-06 05:12:03	millan	and it got me absolutely hooked
2014-11-06 05:12:43	millan	also I am luckier with the downloader - it's going at ~3-4MB/s for me

2014-11-06 05:21:27	flesk_	I think experimental support for Linux was added last week?
2014-11-06 05:21:30	ImperialXT	so it's very buggy atm
2014-11-06 05:21:44	ImperialXT	and I don't have it working as of yet apart from in the demo from the configurator

2014-11-06 05:44:01	Raven67854	to much water and you overcooked it into sludge? :P
2014-11-06 05:45:58	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854: bingo!
2014-11-06 05:46:07	Happy-Ferret	Damn. To eat or not to eat...
2014-11-06 05:46:12	Raven67854	Gotta love doing that
2014-11-06 05:46:23	liamdawe	the war thunder guys really need to work on a ui for the update
2014-11-06 05:47:00	Raven67854	Put to many hours into warthunders
2014-11-06 05:47:08	Raven67854	And I still use my level 5 plane...
2014-11-06 05:47:17	Happy-Ferret	Screw it. Gonna throw it away and cook new one. This time, I'm pouring the water from a cup instead of the sink.
2014-11-06 05:47:49	millan	cooking rice is apparently an art
2014-11-06 05:47:54	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, I've always done 1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water. By time I'm done cooking it I get fluffy rice. Though honestly I'm not really sure how much water you really need. I really want to get a rice cooker but I don't cook rice often enough
2014-11-06 05:48:21	millan	my mother has some magical way of doing it properly with any amount of normal rice and unmeasured water
2014-11-06 05:48:31	millan	I just use rice in boiling bags
2014-11-06 05:48:38	Raven67854	haha
2014-11-06 05:48:47	Raven67854	I have a big 20lb bag of rice
2014-11-06 05:49:00	Beamboom	It's all in how hard you boil the rice. Just let it simmer, not heavy heat.
2014-11-06 05:49:14	Beamboom	amount of water: Twice as much as rice, approx.
2014-11-06 05:49:33	Beamboom	But the clue is in the level of heat :)
2014-11-06 05:50:42	Raven67854	I hate that feeling were you have to sneeze but can't

2014-11-06 05:54:41	Raven67854	I think I should go make some eggs for breakfast

2014-11-06 06:13:56	millan	they help a ton
2014-11-06 06:14:10	millan	also yeah it lacks the "full window" mode and blocks alt tabbing for me
2014-11-06 06:14:21	millan	thankfully i can still use separate virtual desktops
2014-11-06 06:15:48	liamdawe	from what i gather each battle you accrue research points towards new weapons and aircraft?

2014-11-06 06:19:29	millan	yes
2014-11-06 06:19:30	millan	both at once
2014-11-06 06:19:48	millan	and you do not need to upgrade the current plane's modules to progress to other plane
2014-11-06 06:20:00	millan	but it's obviously desirable
2014-11-06 06:20:18	millan	generally unlocking the upgrades of a plane takes just a few matches until like, era 4, where it can get a bit slow
2014-11-06 06:20:20	liamdawe	i see
2014-11-06 06:20:39	liamdawe	once researched, you still need to actually buy the new plans and stuff too it seems, you don't just get access to them
2014-11-06 06:20:47	Raven67854	It's a grind
2014-11-06 06:20:50	millan	also you get bonus research towards next plane by getting tiers of modules in your plane fully unlocked
2014-11-06 06:20:50	Raven67854	few matches my ass
2014-11-06 06:21:00	millan	yes, you have to buy them
2014-11-06 06:21:09	Raven67854	Unless in the past year they've overhauled how the game works
2014-11-06 06:21:14	Raven67854	It's a grind to unlocks planes/upgrades
2014-11-06 06:21:26	millan	at era 3? I often unlock 2-3 modules in one match with a new era 1-3 plane :P
2014-11-06 06:21:48	millan	unlocking planes is always grind, that's true
2014-11-06 06:22:55	liamdawe	it seems the more you kill the faster you research too, and the more money you get, that about right?
2014-11-06 06:23:06	Raven67854	Yes
2014-11-06 06:23:47	liamdawe	well it's not that bad a grind then really if you're a good player :P

2014-11-06 06:31:25	flesk_	liamdawe: Just an hour to go on that release. If you plan on publishing it later I can change the wording in it.
2014-11-06 06:33:40	liamdawe	flesk_: yeah word it up ready for the release and publish it yourself then if you wish :), you only need to send it to admin review if there's stuff you're unsure on/you think i really need another look over
2014-11-06 06:34:20	liamdawe	millan: one of my airoplanes unlocked offensive 7mm, is that good? i purchased it anyway
2014-11-06 06:35:06	millan	that's "belts"
2014-11-06 06:35:22	millan	belts is a special kind of unlock which lets you choose your ammo set
2014-11-06 06:35:34	Raven67854	ammo costs money
2014-11-06 06:35:38	liamdawe	oh does it, the game told me nothing :P
2014-11-06 06:35:39	Raven67854	But good depending on what you plane to fight
2014-11-06 06:35:46	Raven67854	plan*
2014-11-06 06:35:48	millan	and most airplanes have either 7.7mm, 12.7, 20mm, or combination of
2014-11-06 06:35:58	millan	and ammo costs money only unless you use the default ammo
2014-11-06 06:36:15	Raven67854	millan, 50mm all the way
2014-11-06 06:36:17	millan	but the non-default ammo can be better
2014-11-06 06:36:19	millan	shush
2014-11-06 06:36:30	Raven67854	OP as fuck
2014-11-06 06:37:31	Raven67854	The italian plane has 4 102mm cannons
2014-11-06 06:37:43	Raven67854	Oh and torpedoes and defense armaments

2014-11-06 07:03:00	NuSuey	well it had some good ideas..
2014-11-06 07:03:02	Raven67854	I guess
2014-11-06 07:03:10	Raven67854	EA wants to be where league is

2014-11-06 07:03:44	xpander69	EA is fail.. they shut down everything without giving it time to establish a solid base
2014-11-06 07:03:45	NuSuey	I hate EA for being EA and allways destroying almost everything they touch
2014-11-06 07:03:57	xpander69	same happened with Warhammer Online, Warhammer Wrath of Heroes and now that Dawngate
2014-11-06 07:03:58	Raven67854	xpander69, Exactly!

2014-11-06 07:04:34	xpander69	it had 1 milion copies sold at launch

2014-11-06 07:04:44	xpander69	but they fired all staff so no fixes and improvements were done
2014-11-06 07:04:59	Raven67854	They gave it plenty of time to gain a fanbase
2014-11-06 07:05:02	Raven67854	but the game had to many issues
2014-11-06 07:05:08	xpander69	naah they didnt give
2014-11-06 07:05:12	Raven67854	yes they did
2014-11-06 07:05:14	xpander69	they just switched to maintenance mode

2014-11-06 07:05:21	xpander69	cause of GW license
2014-11-06 07:05:38	Raven67854	Was ridiculous the way that game was handled from launch to end
2014-11-06 07:05:47	xpander69	after license expired they could pull the pluig

2014-11-06 07:05:49	Raven67854	I can't believe they fired staff instead of fixing issues when they had 2m subs
2014-11-06 07:06:03	xpander69	its EA
2014-11-06 07:06:10	Raven67854	Do the most backwards thing
2014-11-06 07:06:14	Raven67854	Like with the star wars launch
2014-11-06 07:06:17	Raven67854	sink 250m into it
2014-11-06 07:06:20	liamdawe	millan: i purchased another pilot slot, and purchased the tuck gladiator mk 2

2014-11-06 07:06:22	xpander69	exactly
2014-11-06 07:06:33	Raven67854	Even though it was rough but people did like it
2014-11-06 07:06:44	xpander69	they dont care about people:D

2014-11-06 07:08:37	Raven67854	xpander69, yeah I played it at launch that was great
2014-11-06 07:08:40	xpander69	second mistake was that they launched a bit before WoW expansion...so the bugs drove people away and they went back to WoW

2014-11-06 07:14:14	Raven67854	You still have to have enough money to buy pilots and a plane
2014-11-06 07:14:57	liamdawe	Raven67854: no, you always get the starter plans in each nation it seems

2014-11-06 07:30:38	DrMcCoy	xpander69: Sure, it's just that the number is pretty suspiciously close to 0xFFFFFFFF :P
2014-11-06 07:30:45	xpander69	4096MB and crashes
2014-11-06 07:30:52	xpander69	though i have 16Gig
2014-11-06 07:31:25	millan	liamdawe: yes, it's the entire crew, pilot, gunners, but also ground crew, but that's not super important - crew skills don't have a HUGE effect onto planes
2014-11-06 07:32:26	millan	"seating" the plane into a crew costs money, but you can "seat" the plane in as many slots as you want, but each specific plane can be in use only once in your current roll out lineup
2014-11-06 07:32:28	liamdawe	i thought so, as it seemed each time i went into pilot i had different stars available to bump their stats, that's something the tutorial should have covered <_<
2014-11-06 07:32:38	liamdawe	no wonder im so shit, i haven't levelled my pilots at all
2014-11-06 07:33:00	millan	pretty much only important pilot skills are vitality, then G-Tolerance, and then Stamina
2014-11-06 07:33:05	millan	the first two skills are not important
2014-11-06 07:33:20	millan	Awareness and Spotting or whatever
2014-11-06 07:33:37	millan	again, the pilot skills don't have big effect

2014-11-06 08:10:58	jaycee	too transparent
2014-11-06 08:11:56	Happy-Ferret	It will become opaque when you hover over it and the text color of the specific text will change to white.
2014-11-06 08:12:18	Happy-Ferret	Will probably record a video to outline this.
2014-11-06 08:14:01	Happy-Ferret	Some of the backend GTK+ code is still broken, unfortunately. When I double click on the window it will (unsucessfully) try to resize the window and then exit.

2014-11-06 08:53:20	jaycee	and jeeze clausewitz really sucks as an engine :)
2014-11-06 08:53:25	Happy-Ferret	Anyways. Lord RMS (peace and free software be upon him) enshrined in me the following wisdom.

2014-11-06 08:55:19	liamdawe	the cake is in fact not a lie and he jumped out of it?
2014-11-06 08:55:41	Segata_Sanshiro	the beauty of paradox games is how ridiculously detailed they are - almost to a nerdy, obsessive level that's completely pointles and that's why I love them :)
2014-11-06 08:55:43	liamdawe	you know i might play some dota tonight
2014-11-06 08:55:55	liamdawe	haven't played dota is ages

For if you want to produce sofware for your clients, thou shalst also be the one controlling the underlying OS.

2014-11-06 08:58:34	Happy-Ferret	His messages are really cryptic and badly written but make sense, somewhat. Why settle with selling custom Windows/Mac software to one's clients when one can also provide the OS along with it.
2014-11-06 08:59:15	Segata_Sanshiro	@Samsai, I recommend EU4 over CK2 because it's still very playable without knowing the game too well.  The most straightforward is Victoria 2 but that's not on Linux
2014-11-06 08:59:16	Happy-Ferret	And GNU/Linux is an obvious choice. Being free and open and whatnot.
2014-11-06 08:59:40	@Samsai	Segata_Sanshiro, i was starting to get into CK2 but the crashes are holding me back
2014-11-06 09:00:09	@Samsai	and i'm fairly sure i can learn CK2 properly, i had some minor success in HoI3 after all
2014-11-06 09:00:32	@Samsai	well... success is a bit relative: i managed to keep the soviets out when winter war happened
2014-11-06 09:01:07	Segata_Sanshiro	@Samsai - I had no idea the game crashes... still not played it much, just end up just playing EU4 sickening amounts
2014-11-06 09:01:52	Segata_Sanshiro	haha but that's easy! just get a couple of thousand Finns with skis and wipe out the entire red army
2014-11-06 09:02:26	@Samsai	Segata_Sanshiro, it would have been easier if i had mobilized a bit earlier
2014-11-06 09:02:45	@Samsai	at first i was stuck with only partial reserve divisions
2014-11-06 09:03:38	@Samsai	sadly the game won't work under wine, i'd like to try my hand at it again
2014-11-06 09:04:56	millan	baaaaaah
2014-11-06 09:04:58	Segata_Sanshiro	it's a good game. It's the most military-focused one out of all of them though, which is kind of why I prefer the others because there are more factors
2014-11-06 09:05:17	Segata_Sanshiro	Victoria 2 works well under Wine
2014-11-06 09:05:24	jaycee	clausewitz just about works on windows, let alone wine ;)

2014-11-06 10:43:31	Raven67854	Segata_Sanshiro, have to get it from them
2014-11-06 10:43:45	Segata_Sanshiro	ohhh ook
2014-11-06 10:43:53	xpander69	steam version will come later
2014-11-06 10:44:06	xpander69	probably when they are ready with launcher UI and stuff like that
2014-11-06 10:44:12	xpander69	at least thats what their FAQ states
2014-11-06 10:44:26	Raven67854	I don't remember the steam version having a launcher. But maybe it did
2014-11-06 10:45:02	xpander69	i dont actually know either..Star Conflict doesnt have for example..
2014-11-06 10:45:04	jaycee	you can also put stuff on steam, but not on the store, so you get it by steam key or by assignment... but i guess this is becoming unpopular because of steamdb.info leaking things
2014-11-06 10:45:11	xpander69	i played the non-steam version in wine
2014-11-06 10:45:16	xpander69	before
2014-11-06 10:45:34	xpander69	but their FAQ states: "The Steam Linux version will be launched at a later date. The Full UI launcher is also yet to come, although it is not required - you can change game settings within the game."
2014-11-06 10:46:52	jaycee	hm if you can do that, why even have a launcher
2014-11-06 10:47:01	jaycee	personally i hate pointless launchers
2014-11-06 10:47:35	mirv_	I'm guessing war thunder is a grinding game?
2014-11-06 10:48:15	@Samsai	mirv_, f2p games tend to be
2014-11-06 10:48:31	@Samsai	except hat simulator 20everyyear
2014-11-06 10:48:39	Segata_Sanshiro	oh god it's extractig crap everywhere
2014-11-06 10:48:52	xpander69	Segata_Sanshiro, you didnt read their page?:D
2014-11-06 10:48:56	mirv_	think I'll give it a miss - the grid gets far too tedious unless you play with friends
2014-11-06 10:49:00	Segata_Sanshiro	no...
2014-11-06 10:49:01	xpander69	it said that make folder for it where you like:D
2014-11-06 10:49:31	Segata_Sanshiro	haha well guess I'll move it all out of downloads then after
2014-11-06 10:49:48	mirv_	*the grind, rather
2014-11-06 10:50:02	xpander69	mirv_, exactly... i mostly play this with friends..and its super fun :D ..when i play alone i just do few quick matches and then quit
2014-11-06 10:50:06	xpander69	nothing longterm:D
2014-11-06 10:50:09	<--	beansmyname (beansmynam@unaffiliated/beansmyname) has left #gamingonlinux ("gone baby gone")
2014-11-06 10:50:33	liamdawe	jaycee: the launcher does the updating
2014-11-06 10:50:48	liamdawe	jaycee: on linux it's all silent unless you do it in the terminal, i dislike that = i want a launcher
2014-11-06 10:51:06	xpander69	liamdawe, you are not 1337 enough :(
2014-11-06 10:51:08	xpander69	:D
2014-11-06 10:51:19	liamdawe	my hate for the terminal is well documented by now :P
2014-11-06 10:51:47	Segata_Sanshiro	there's no progress bar or anything to know if it's done or not... guess I should have ran it through terminal
2014-11-06 10:52:31	jaycee	hopefully theyll be smart enough to let steam do it on the steam version
2014-11-06 10:53:15	liamdawe	Segata_Sanshiro: i did put it in bold in the article to run it in terminal :P
2014-11-06 10:53:38	@Samsai	you can download the high-res textures and voice-overs separately
2014-11-06 10:53:43	@Samsai	that's pretty cool
2014-11-06 10:53:52	xpander69	i use that script to run it :D http://pastebin.com/6QXt7DRB

2014-11-06 10:54:09	liamdawe	merr im not sure if i will keep playing it anyway
2014-11-06 10:54:11	Segata_Sanshiro	liamdawe yup guess i'm not too good at reading either....
2014-11-06 10:54:25	mirv_	xpander69, can it be played decently with a controller, or is it mouse & keyboard only?
2014-11-06 10:54:37	xpander69	mirv_, i dont use controllers so no clue
2014-11-06 10:54:39	Raven67854	either or
2014-11-06 10:54:45	Raven67854	But I don't know on Linux
2014-11-06 10:54:49	Raven67854	It plays fine on keyboard though
2014-11-06 10:54:59	liamdawe	i prefer to straight up pay for a game, and progress and unlock normally, i don't really like the grind paywall multicurrency stuff
2014-11-06 10:55:02	mirv_	could be a good couch game if it handles controllers ok
2014-11-06 10:55:18	liamdawe	but i guess if enough of you lot play it then i might stick around on it
2014-11-06 10:56:54	xpander69	the problem is that you can play only arcade matched with friends who have different countries for planes/tanks selected
2014-11-06 10:57:15	Raven67854	I play it on my PS4
2014-11-06 10:57:16	xpander69	with realistic you get the country of your squad leader
2014-11-06 10:57:18	Raven67854	Quite nice to play on the PS4
2014-11-06 10:57:32	xpander69	and if you have shit planes/tanks for that country then good luck:D
2014-11-06 10:58:19	xpander69	Raven67854, crossplatform multiplayer?
2014-11-06 10:58:25	Segata_Sanshiro	liamdawe, so if i click the updater agaain it will stop and i can resume it through the terminal
2014-11-06 10:58:26	xpander69	or couch flowers have their own servers?
2014-11-06 10:58:28	Raven67854	xpander69, I think so.. I honestly have no idea
2014-11-06 10:58:29	Segata_Sanshiro	?
2014-11-06 10:58:38	liamdawe	Segata_Sanshiro: i just killed the updater process
2014-11-06 10:58:41	liamdawe	and ran it again in term
2014-11-06 10:58:53	xpander69	yes it checks files you have
2014-11-06 10:58:53	Segata_Sanshiro	oh ok, i'll do that then
2014-11-06 10:58:58	xpander69	and continues from where it left

2014-11-06 16:36:24	von	ss3 on ultra runs very smoothly for me now
2014-11-06 16:36:24	Segata_Sanshiro	sure, I could do that but it's no good playing a game under 30
2014-11-06 16:36:31	Segata_Sanshiro	it should run over 30 on my card
2014-11-06 16:36:36	Segata_Sanshiro	probably closer to 60
2014-11-06 16:36:53	von	well, you can get more than 150 at the lowest setting possible

2014-11-06 16:44:00	Segata_Sanshiro	but doing this free beta was a good idea so they can fix these things before release :)

2014-11-09 11:49:43	@Samsai	funnily enough i saw one of his videos pop up in my suggestions earlier today

2014-11-09 11:52:32	liamdawe	i gave him the usual, prove trust, send it to us first, we approve it/do the uploading and if proven trustworthy they can have access themselves
2014-11-09 11:52:37	liamdawe	same deal for everyone
2014-11-09 12:00:27	@Samsai	his videos are very to-the-point
2014-11-09 12:00:40	@Samsai	should balance my long ramblings
2014-11-09 12:10:14	liamdawe	hah
2014-11-09 12:10:34	liamdawe	the more i talk to the insurgency devs, the more annoyed i get
2014-11-09 12:10:53	liamdawe	going to leave it now before it becomes another 7 days
2014-11-09 12:15:06	jaycee	the correct answer from them is "when its done" :)
2014-11-09 12:17:04	jaycee	this is also why we dont announce we're doing a linux port of anything until its at least alpha
2014-11-09 12:17:39	jaycee	and why we get annoyed that steamdb.info essentially leaks this info before we're ready to announce
2014-11-09 12:18:02	liamdawe	i just find it insane to advertise linux will be supported, not even check your engine will 100% be updated to support it, and then silently drop the mentions of it
2014-11-09 12:19:10	jaycee	its kinda lame to blame valve too, because i doubt valve have licensed source saying "linux is a supported platform" just yet, when they havent even got all of their own titles running
2014-11-09 12:19:19	jaycee	portal 2 is still beta isnt it?
2014-11-09 12:19:59	Coolgeek	mayben but didn't experienced any weird thing with it
2014-11-09 12:20:11	jaycee	yeah but its still considered beta
2014-11-09 12:20:17	jaycee	you dont license beta versions of your engine
2014-11-09 12:20:24	jaycee	not if youre guaranteeing support
2014-11-09 12:21:19	liamdawe	it does feel like they are playing the blame game
2014-11-09 12:21:25	@Samsai	at least insurgency has a real reason that's holding them back
2014-11-09 12:21:32	liamdawe	kndeed
2014-11-09 12:21:35	@Samsai	unlike some unfunny people
2014-11-09 12:21:35	liamdawe	indeed*
2014-11-09 12:21:50	jaycee	yeah, but its their fault for announcing linux support when they full well knew Valve were not ready to provide it
2014-11-09 12:22:29	@Samsai	it is, but we shouldn't compare them to people who can't even drag and drop files
2014-11-09 12:22:31	jaycee	thing is, being hostile towards the dev isnt really going to improve matters
2014-11-09 12:22:49	liamdawe	no one is being hostile anywhere jaycee
2014-11-09 12:23:02	liamdawe	it's all been perfectly civil
2014-11-09 12:23:18	jaycee	i dunno so much liam, i have seen this before.. "xyz dev ripped off linux gamers because it's not released yet"
2014-11-09 12:23:34	jaycee	ive seen plenty of hostility towards Larian for example, because the linux port isnt out yet, people claiming scam etc
2014-11-09 12:24:14	liamdawe	no point dragging other examples into this, we are only talking about insurgency here
2014-11-09 12:24:30	jaycee	this is why we just dont announce what we're working on until we're sure its going to be released on that platform
2014-11-09 12:25:51	@Samsai	liamdawe, by the way, the 7dtd people said they are "dangerously close to a linux port"
2014-11-09 12:26:02	@Samsai	any guestimates how many years more it's going to take?
2014-11-09 12:26:59	liamdawe	next alpha will be released with no mention of Linux again :P
2014-11-09 12:28:08	@Samsai	i wouldn't even be surprised
2014-11-09 12:30:17	jaycee	i think the sound advice here is as liam says - if you only want it for linux, dont buy it until its out, regardless of whats been announced
2014-11-09 12:30:24	jaycee	sometimes its not even technical problems that stop a release
2014-11-09 12:30:55	jaycee	we worked on our Mac version of Riddick, and shelved it for 2 years or so, because of some legal spat between Atari, Starbreeze, Universal and Tigon
2014-11-09 12:31:22	@Samsai	well, 7dtd has had a lot of technical problems regarding the linux port
2014-11-09 12:31:45	@Samsai	like not being able to figure out how to copy and paste files for example

2014-11-09 12:33:42	@Samsai	jaycee, their steam integration plugin or something like that was causing problems with linux
2014-11-09 12:33:46	jaycee	like how my mac refuses to show itself in Network Neighborhood
2014-11-09 12:33:52	@Samsai	and apparently the new version "wasn't compatible"
2014-11-09 12:34:12	jaycee	Samsai, some of the older steam_api.so's dont work at all, but yeah, thats the older ones
2014-11-09 12:34:30	@Samsai	funny thing was that the issue was solved by a community member
2014-11-09 12:34:38	jaycee	we have code in eON now that emulates the older steam_api's with the newer one
2014-11-09 12:34:46	@Samsai	all he did was copy the file from another game that used a newer version of the same plugin
2014-11-09 12:35:29	jaycee	right, but nicking bits from other developers games isnt what would occur to a commercial dev

2014-11-09 12:35:46	@Samsai	yup, they would just download the new version
2014-11-09 12:35:53	@Samsai	because they have access to it
2014-11-09 12:36:03	jaycee	youre assuming they do
2014-11-09 12:36:10	jaycee	middleware is a tricky thing
2014-11-09 12:36:19	jaycee	often youre licensed for a particular version only
2014-11-09 12:36:20	@Samsai	are you suggesting they haven't bought that plugin?
2014-11-09 12:36:48	@Samsai	they could have of course nicked an old version from piratebay, wouldn't surprise me
2014-11-09 12:36:52	jaycee	i am suggesting that it is not always as simple as "just get the latest one"
2014-11-09 12:37:32	@Samsai	if i recall correctly that plugin offered free updates
2014-11-09 12:37:34	@Samsai	so yeah
2014-11-09 12:37:47	jaycee	right, but as a commercial dev, you cannot just assume this
2014-11-09 12:37:56	jaycee	there are usually business people who take care of such matters
2014-11-09 12:38:08	@Samsai	oh, that would explain everything!
2014-11-09 12:38:20	@Samsai	maybe the business people also only work on their spare time?
2014-11-09 12:38:54	liamdawe	hah
2014-11-09 12:39:22	jaycee	what i am saying is you cannot take the open source view of development with commercial dev, when youre licensing middleware because it just does not happen that way

2014-11-09 12:43:24	jaycee	"It was also around the time that Valve started doing Linux ports of their own games and we were always under the impression that they would provide the necessary source code for Linux". hm
2014-11-09 12:43:43	jaycee	"Under the impression" very much sounds to me like "we just figured theyd release their linux stuff but we didnt actually ask them when it'd be ready to ship"
2014-11-09 12:44:58	jaycee	but what i must say is when the community starts with accusations of developers "ripping them off" and saying things like "they cant even copy files".. its inclined to make the devs think "for the 1% market share we're going to get from this, should we really bother?"
2014-11-09 12:45:01	Cheeseness	There have been developers in the past who've stated that they've been waiting for Valve to get them stuff, when Valve have had stuff available and didn't know that there was somebody waiting to be told about it
2014-11-09 12:45:37	Cheeseness	And developers who've been under the impression that all older Source branches will get Linux support (which I don't think is happening at all?)
2014-11-09 12:47:20	jaycee	you dont announce a platform until youre sure you can support it tbh
2014-11-09 12:47:31	Cheeseness	I agree
2014-11-09 12:47:34	jaycee	it does make me wonder why portal 2 is still considered beta
2014-11-09 12:47:38	jaycee	what issues theyre having etc
2014-11-09 12:49:18	liamdawe	obviously issues like this are gradually going away with more and more engines having Linux support
2014-11-09 12:49:28	jaycee	https://github.com/ValveSoftware/portal2/issues quite a few it seems

2014-11-09 12:52:02	Cheeseness	liamdawe: For future stuff, yeah. For existing/legacy stuff, probably not. Lots of devs don't like the idea of upgrading engine versions and dealing with the possible bugs that might be introduced to an otherwise stable game.

2014-11-09 13:08:51	jaycee	im not sure but it seems to, i guess it needs to because it has to support what window recieved the input
2014-11-09 13:08:52	Sik	I guess you could say X11 code should be removed but SDL2 in general is designed around "drivers" for each subsystem, so it's easy to keep around support for several APIs
2014-11-09 13:08:57	jaycee	and udev doesnt give you that
2014-11-09 13:09:10	jaycee	udev's only really good for "DirectInput" type situations
2014-11-09 13:09:33	Sik	That said, at some point I had a problem with detecting when a joystick was connected or removed
2014-11-09 13:09:52	Sik	Turns out that you need udev for that, and by default that wasn't installed... (I guess it was the development library that wasn't=
2014-11-09 13:09:53	Sik	)
2014-11-09 13:09:58	Sik	That was very easy to miss
2014-11-09 13:10:24	Sik	It's not like the case with X11 where you outright can't create a window unless you install the library
2014-11-09 13:10:35	Sik	(which also alerts you to installing the OpenGL library as well)
2014-11-09 13:10:41	jaycee	yeah a lot of people are under the impression that SDL2 just "takes care of everything", but sadly no, it doesnt
2014-11-09 13:11:03	Sik	There's a file that's basically a list of every package you should install before building SDL
2014-11-09 13:11:12	Sik	Just do sudo apt-get install <that giant list>
2014-11-09 13:11:20	jaycee	since as sdl2 can be configured to build without a lot of things, and it just then omits support that requires those things to work
2014-11-09 13:11:21	Sik	For some reason it's not included in the SDL source code though
2014-11-09 13:11:37	jaycee	Sik, its also a pain if you need to build an i386 version
2014-11-09 13:11:47	jaycee	multilib just plain out doesnt work for -dev stuff most of the time
2014-11-09 13:12:06	Sik	That in general is painful as hell though :P
2014-11-09 13:12:26	jaycee	its not really ,there is a standard for how to do it, but most packages just cant or wont update
2014-11-09 13:12:44	jaycee	probably because the premise is "just build it for your system arch, whats the problem"
2014-11-09 13:12:48	Sik	I wonder how bad it is compared to using MinGW-w64
2014-11-09 13:12:59	Sik	(reason: every library has its own different method for crosscompiling)
2014-11-09 13:13:28	jaycee	meh, if youre building it for windows, build it with microsoft's compiler - no reason not to
2014-11-09 13:13:39	Sik	And yeah, actually it's worse, "just share the source code and let others build on their system"
2014-11-09 13:13:52	Sik	And um, maybe that I don't have a Windows computer here?
2014-11-09 13:14:07	jaycee	so run their compiler under wine or something
2014-11-09 13:14:09	Sik	(and even when I did, I had to move data around with a pendrive, slowing down things a lot)
2014-11-09 13:14:41	jaycee	you cant build for the mac without a mac, so why try to build for windows without windows
2014-11-09 13:14:58	jaycee	even more so given that windows is vastly different to a unix based os
2014-11-09 13:15:12	Sik	Why try to build for Windows when you don't even want it in the first place (seriously, I wouldn't bother if it didn't have 90% market share)

2014-11-09 13:15:43	jaycee	well then youre talking about a business decison and unfortunately you have to suck it up :)
2014-11-09 13:15:53	Sik	To be fair, looking at SDL2 and how platforms in general seem to be, Windows and Linux are actually closer to each other than against other platforms
2014-11-09 13:16:18	Sik	OSX is slowly moving into a different direction, and mobile is such a different beast that trying to make code portable for them is stupid
2014-11-09 13:16:21	jaycee	the difference is on windows and osx, you really dont need the assistance of SDL2
2014-11-09 13:16:23	jaycee	on linux, you do
2014-11-09 13:16:43	jaycee	because linux just has so many api's for the same thing, and SDL2 covers over all that nonsense
2014-11-09 13:17:03	jaycee	on windows, directx has it all covered. on osx, the system pretty much has it all covered
2014-11-09 13:17:07	Sik	To be fair SDL2 also makes it much easier to deal with the OS >.> Seriously Microsoft, stop making your APIs so verbose
2014-11-09 13:17:20	jaycee	seriously?
2014-11-09 13:17:29	Sik	I find their APIs too verbose :/
2014-11-09 13:17:36	Sik	But then again I have trouble with 3rd party code in general
2014-11-09 13:17:39	jaycee	thats better than not flexible enough
2014-11-09 13:17:44	Sik	A lot of stuff seems too complex to me
2014-11-09 13:18:14	jaycee	and at least windows is well documented in MSDN. OS X docs are a joke, most of the time looking at the headers is better
2014-11-09 13:18:41	Sik	OK yeah gonna give that, the MSDN documentation is good for the most part
2014-11-09 13:18:52	Sik	At least if you know (or have an idea of) what you're looking for
2014-11-09 13:19:09	jaycee	and way better than manpages

2014-11-09 13:20:15	Sik	Most libraries won't bother coming with manpages :P
2014-11-09 13:21:58	Sik	For the record, in GDNet there's a thread asking why people don't use GCC on Windows
2014-11-09 13:22:09	Sik	The general answer is "because tools only work with Visual Studio"
2014-11-09 13:22:12	Sik	:x

2014-11-09 13:24:00	Sik	Also another issue is that many libraries only come with support for VS on Windows even if they use GCC on Linux - so if you use MinGW(-w64) you have to figure out a way to use the Linux makefiles to make a Windows build
2014-11-09 13:24:31	Sik	And then there's the issue that many people still insist on using MinGW (which is stuck in the pre-XP era) instead of MinGW-w64
2014-11-09 13:24:35	Sik	>_____>
2014-11-09 13:24:51	Sik	I just added code in my game that will make compiling fail if it's MinGW instead of MinGW-w64

2014-11-10 01:55:19	Dezponia	I think we'll have to wait a good few years before the GNU/Linux ecosystem adjust well for gaming. Particullary Wayland and a new openGL 5.x spec seem like a solid start. Driver development will (hopefully) improve with time now that more focus is being given to these areas
2014-11-10 01:55:45	Dezponia	Maybe we'll even see a SDL3 come along and further ease the transition for developers

2014-11-10 02:40:56	jaycee	heh Geldriech making some pretty bold statements
2014-11-10 02:47:11	jaycee	doesnt look good if valve really had to fight to get performance of Source up on GL, given how old Source is
2014-11-10 02:53:55	von	I also disagree with comments about Source on linux outperforming Source on windows. It's not the case at least with Dota 2
2014-11-10 02:56:09	jaycee	yeah, its bullshit. i cant replicate that either
2014-11-10 02:56:30	jaycee	same machine, same hardware, windows 7 is running HL2, L4D etc much faster
2014-11-10 02:56:41	Cheeseness	von: In the blog post where that was discussed, they said that they'd already taken the things they'd done which increased performance on Linux and applied it to the Windows versions of Source as well
2014-11-10 02:57:02	von	hm
2014-11-10 02:57:14	jaycee	right so more about that they optimised Source, not so much that "GL is faster"
2014-11-10 02:57:20	jaycee	GL just has too much crap in it
2014-11-10 02:57:34	jaycee	when theres like, at least 4 ways to upload a texture...
2014-11-10 02:57:54	Cheeseness	The big thing they were talking about I think was the learning and insight they were able to gain by working with drivers' source and being able to profile the way their engine worked within them
2014-11-10 02:58:40	jaycee	i guess the key point here is, thats nice for eeking out the last bit of performance on windows, but the game already runs really well by then
2014-11-10 02:58:49	jaycee	but on GL, it is required to even get baseline performance

2014-11-10 03:01:29	Cheeseness	Maybe, or maybe there are other factors at work
2014-11-10 03:01:50	Cheeseness	Legacy engines can't really reveal much IMO
2014-11-10 03:02:17	Cheeseness	Stuff that targets OpenGL from the beginning is likely to imply more about the comparative differences
2014-11-10 03:02:45	jaycee	i have some inside info from developers of UE4 that really dont show that to be the case
2014-11-10 03:04:18	Cheeseness	I'm not sure that that really has much meaning either. How rigorously are Epic targeting OpenGL?
2014-11-10 03:04:20	jaycee	also consider when youre on a tight deadline, which api do you choose.. the one that makes you do 2-3 times the work? or the one that will get you the most performance on the main platform ?
2014-11-10 03:04:29	jaycee	very
2014-11-10 03:04:39	Cheeseness	I never said anything about what was the best choice or what was more or less work
2014-11-10 03:07:26	jaycee	right but thats kinda the point, it people want devs to use it..
2014-11-10 03:07:51	jaycee	i hope with gl next they really do have the balls to just completely throw away a large part of GL as it is now, and keep only what they really need
2014-11-10 03:07:53	Cheeseness	My point was that Source isn't a good example for the kind of assertions you're making
2014-11-10 03:07:58	jaycee	and sort out the extension hell
2014-11-10 03:08:17	jaycee	Cheeseness, why isnt it? it's an old engine now...
2014-11-10 03:08:29	Cheeseness	lol, that's one of the reasons why
2014-11-10 03:08:36	jaycee	what?
2014-11-10 03:08:49	jaycee	its an older engine which is not even state of the art any more
2014-11-10 03:09:02	jaycee	if GL cant handle that, it has no chance of handling engines doing stuff with D3D10/11

2014-11-10 03:21:04	DrMcCoy	i'm fine with pointing out valid issues. but attacking a d6 rpg system for not rolling enough d20 is silly
2014-11-10 03:23:24	jaycee	and what exactly is not valid about his claims?
2014-11-10 03:24:35	jaycee	drivers are generally rubbish (except nvidia), X11 is a bottleneck, and you have to fight with GL to get performance
2014-11-10 03:24:41	jaycee	is basically the gist of it

2014-11-10 03:57:27	jaycee	well they should given how important nvidias support is
2014-11-10 03:57:41	jaycee	the point is, it shouldnt *matter* whether the driver is open or closed
2014-11-10 03:57:50	jaycee	make an API, document it, there
2014-11-10 03:57:50	sobkas	jaycee: for them it isn't
2014-11-10 03:58:41	jaycee	if you require the driver source to be open for things to work, that is a fail
2014-11-10 03:58:50	DerRidda	Damn, that Astro guy is still butthurt about not having 32bit XCOM.
2014-11-10 03:58:53	jaycee	windows manages it, os x manages it, so can linux
2014-11-10 04:00:52	sobkas	jaycee: yes it would be possible, but there is finite number of developers working on linux
2014-11-10 04:01:44	sobkas	jaycee: who is going to do that when no one is interested in it?
2014-11-10 04:01:57	jaycee	its not even hard, like i said, design an API that the driver has to implement, and thats it
2014-11-10 04:02:11	Cheeseness	lol

2014-11-10 04:14:15	jaycee	what they dont get is, it won't be nvidia's loss, it'll be theirs
2014-11-10 04:14:32	jaycee	nvidia is the only driver worth using performance wise right now
2014-11-10 04:14:58	sobkas	jaycee: your believe is based on what?
2014-11-10 04:16:40	jaycee	reading how a lot of the big linux devs talk
2014-11-10 04:17:12	jaycee	they would rather stick to their idealism of open source than allow a small concession that would bring a vastly superior driver to the table
2014-11-10 04:17:51	jaycee	and rather bad mouth nvidia because nvidia refuses to concede to their demands to open source the driver
2014-11-10 04:18:14	DerRidda	The open source developers focus on open source. In other news: Water still wet.
2014-11-10 04:18:35	jaycee	DerRidda, fine, but id say what they also do, is actively try to lock nvidia out
2014-11-10 04:18:45	DerRidda	Are they?
2014-11-10 04:18:55	DerRidda	And what about AMD's driver plans?
2014-11-10 04:19:03	jaycee	what about them?
2014-11-10 04:19:07	jaycee	AMD are fucked if they dont do something
2014-11-10 04:19:12	jaycee	catalyst is dreadful
2014-11-10 04:19:47	DerRidda	Open source almost everything and keep a proprietary user space portion for the heavy lifting.
2014-11-10 04:20:18	jaycee	i guarantee mesa will object to this when they start to do it, and start refusing amd's code
2014-11-10 04:20:32	Cheeseness	What kind of guarantee?
2014-11-10 04:20:44	jaycee	wait and see
2014-11-10 04:20:53	DerRidda	That#s not what guarantee means.
2014-11-10 04:20:55	Cheeseness	That's not much of a guarantee
2014-11-10 04:20:56	jaycee	open source zealots are dreadful
2014-11-10 04:21:04	sobkas	jaycee: refuse to include amd code? since when?
2014-11-10 04:21:19	sobkas	jaycee: mesa is full of amd's code
2014-11-10 04:21:30	jaycee	sobkas, wait until amd actually produce code for mesa which relies on a closed source binary component
2014-11-10 04:21:59	mirv_	amd won't - that's the point, there will be the open source alternative as well
2014-11-10 04:22:26	sobkas	jaycee: GL library will be closed, kernel driver and X driver will be open
2014-11-10 04:22:29	jaycee	mirv_, thats what their new plan says though, they will have a proprietary portion and an open source portion
2014-11-10 04:22:51	jaycee	sobkas, right, and isnt MESA abou opengl? you really think theyll be fine with a proprietary opengl part?
2014-11-10 04:22:53	jaycee	i dont
2014-11-10 04:22:59	mirv_	jaycee, yes, but they can't submit code that relies on the closed part
2014-11-10 04:23:08	mirv_	it will have to work with the open part as well
2014-11-10 04:23:18	sobkas	jaycee: so no code in mesa will depend on closed code
2014-11-10 04:23:47	jaycee	great, so amd will end up having to keep their own fork of mesa when the open source zealots working on mesa start bitching because amd isnt 100% open source and do all they can to frustrate AMD's efforts to work with them
2014-11-10 04:24:28	jaycee	there is an english saying "cutting your nose off to spite your face" which readily applies to alot of linux development
2014-11-10 04:24:33	mirv_	I personally don't think anyone gets in the way of proprietary areas - they just don't help it either
2014-11-10 04:25:07	sobkas	jaycee: how amds gl implementation mixes with mesa one?
2014-11-10 04:25:34	sobkas	jaycee: the codebase is separate
2014-11-10 04:26:01	mirv_	now to be on the other side of the fence for a moment....

2014-11-10 04:46:59	jaycee	point is, major kernel dev has just admitted they are deliberately locking out nvidias binary driver
2014-11-10 04:47:05	jaycee	im sure theres other things theyre doing too
2014-11-10 04:47:53	Morgawr	so jaycee, why do you actually care about linux gaming if most of your time in here is spent whining about open source, again?
2014-11-10 04:48:21	sobkas	Morgawr: he complains because he cares
2014-11-10 04:48:29	jaycee	because it frustrates me that linux is being held back by idiocy and zealotry
2014-11-10 04:48:52	jaycee	open source is good. forced open source is not
2014-11-10 04:49:03	DerRidda	Yes, the openness towards proprietary stuff has worked out for BSD so well after all. Oh wait.
2014-11-10 04:49:16	jaycee	DerRidda, what ?
2014-11-10 04:49:18	Cheeseness	"forced open source"
2014-11-10 04:49:21	Cheeseness	The mind boggles
2014-11-10 04:49:28	jaycee	you mean like, how FreeBSD is the core of PS4's OS ? :)
2014-11-10 04:49:41	jaycee	Cheeseness, yes, and thats effectively what GPL is
2014-11-10 04:49:42	Morgawr	Linux exists because of open source (what you call idiocy and zealotry), dropping a whole ideology because of a temporary boost in performance (because of a shitty proprietary driver) is a rather shortsighted view
2014-11-10 04:50:01	jaycee	haha
2014-11-10 04:50:02	sobkas	jaycee: but neither linux developers owns nvidia anything
2014-11-10 04:50:05	Cheeseness	jaycee: lol, are you serious? You're not one of those "The GPL is viral" nutters are you?
2014-11-10 04:50:05	jaycee	a "shitty" proprietary driver
2014-11-10 04:50:06	jaycee	reall
2014-11-10 04:50:18	jaycee	you mean the ONLY LINUX DRIVER that actually has any decent 3d performance...
2014-11-10 04:50:22	von	it actually is viral
2014-11-10 04:50:30	Cheeseness	Not at all
2014-11-10 04:50:30	Morgawr	just because in 2014 it makes sense to help nvidia lobbying, it doesn't mean that's going to be a good choice in the long run
2014-11-10 04:50:33	DerRidda	Yes and OS X is based on BSD projects, but any BSD is out there on it's own barely benefiting from anything that's going on in these closed up projects.
2014-11-10 04:50:35	jaycee	Cheeseness, yes because it is, and GNU even admit it is
2014-11-10 04:50:37	von	for good or bad is another matter entirely
2014-11-10 04:50:52	Cheeseness	Viral implies that it's beyond control, that it infects without permission or intent
2014-11-10 04:51:16	Morgawr	the Linux kernel doesn't care, the Linux kernel is the Linux kernel and it does its thing, that's how it has survived and how it has become successful (by going against "the flow")
2014-11-10 04:51:17	jaycee	DerRidda, funny because freebsd has the proprietary nvidia binary  driver too.. and they dont bitch about it
2014-11-10 04:51:18	Cheeseness	Since a developer has to choose to adopt it, that is clearly not the case, no matter how many people like to cry about it
2014-11-10 04:51:22	Morgawr	if you want proprietary crap, go with proprietary operating systems
2014-11-10 04:51:47	jaycee	Morgawr, ok so basically what youre saying is, game devs should just forget about linux
2014-11-10 04:51:51	Morgawr	no
2014-11-10 04:52:04	Morgawr	I'm amazed at your ability to read inbetween the lines
2014-11-10 04:52:09	jaycee	but you are, because with this attitude, you will never have 3d performance worth a damn

2014-11-10 04:52:46	Morgawr	sobkas: feel free to, I'm not going to stop you
2014-11-10 04:52:46	jaycee	please dont point to r600 as an example, because the only thing that supports well is now-old hardware
2014-11-10 04:53:01	jaycee	intel's driver is rubbish, and their gpu's are rubbish anyway
2014-11-10 04:53:21	Morgawr	idk, I play games comfortably enough with my intel GPU :)
2014-11-10 04:53:41	jaycee	right, little indie low end games no doubt, or pretty old ones like Source based stuff
2014-11-10 04:54:14	Morgawr	Metro The Last Light, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Civilization 5, Serious Sam 3 (and Talos Principle) are all indie low end games and "pretty old" source games, then?
2014-11-10 04:55:02	jaycee	then i conclude youre lying or something, because the intel driver doesnt run anything worth a shit
2014-11-10 04:55:15	jaycee	hell half of it doesnt even *work*
2014-11-10 04:55:24	Morgawr	that's a very childish response over a factual statement that it indeed does run the game I mentioned above (as I play them, after all)
2014-11-10 04:55:31	Morgawr	games*
2014-11-10 04:55:47	Morgawr	it doesn't run some games, it has some bugs in some other games (wasteland 2 doesn't work for example, but it does work inside wine) so I'm not denying that
2014-11-10 04:55:55	Morgawr	but still it's decent and fits my needs
2014-11-10 04:56:23	Morgawr	calling it rubbish is laughable as it is amazing what it can run in such a small dice
2014-11-10 04:57:27	DerRidda	The only thing that is really holding back game performance on Linux is threaded OpenGL not working well (or at all).
2014-11-10 04:58:22	jaycee	there is no threaded opengl
2014-11-10 04:58:33	jaycee	its as simple as that
2014-11-10 04:58:49	sobkas	jaycee: threaded driver?
2014-11-10 04:58:52	jaycee	thats more to do with GL itself, apple have made some attempt to make it happen, but its not very good there either
2014-11-10 04:59:39	sobkas	jaycee: and sadly opengl is not opencl
2014-11-10 04:59:58	jaycee	to be fair the way DX9 did it was quite a hassle for the driver, so D3D10/11 switched to a different method.. but gl doesnt really do that either
2014-11-10 05:00:18	jaycee	so what you end up with is stuff like CSMT
2014-11-10 05:00:35	DerRidda	And it probably won't be remedied until OpenGL next is a thing, whenever that will be.
2014-11-10 05:02:17	sobkas	jaycee: as I can see dmabuf might be a problem for nvidia, it doesn't change the fact that stable api on linux would be hard and developers just don't care about it, they have their own problems to resolve

2014-11-10 05:31:38	Dezponia	Happy-Ferret: Pretty sure openSUSE has made it so users can add printers without admin help. This after Linus yelled at them for making the computer hard to use for his daugther in school with their printer
2014-11-10 05:32:21	Happy-Ferret	Interesting. Do you know whether they realize this through their frontend or simply change default CUPS policies?
2014-11-10 05:37:11	Dezponia	Happy-Ferret: No idea what they did, just that they solved it
2014-11-10 05:38:22	Happy-Ferret	Even Mac OS X seems to require an admin passwort in order to add/remove printers. Seems kinda ridiculous, unless people use their printers to print out highly confidential data that hackers might then re-route to their network printers.

2014-11-10 06:58:14	jaycee	also the shell is not really heavily used by the system on os x, unlike linux
2014-11-10 06:58:18	Morgawr	you don't need to ssh to be vulnerable

2014-11-10 06:59:14	Happy-Ferret	Otherwise, you wouldn't be vulnerable.
2014-11-10 06:59:56	Happy-Ferret	Anyways. Gonna patch my family's machines on Thursday, once I passed my finals exam. They don't currently use them anyways.
2014-11-10 07:00:06	jaycee	yeah because its not really that common for a mac user to run a shell script
2014-11-10 07:00:18	jaycee	and if they do, theyre more likely to use sh, not bash
2014-11-10 07:00:25	Morgawr	apple doesn't have cgi with apache (or similar) or a vulnerable dhcp implementation? (spoilers: I know nothing about apple userland)
2014-11-10 07:00:34	Morgawr	although, maybe apple doesn't link /bin/sh to /bin/bash, does it?
2014-11-10 07:00:47	jaycee	apple has apache, but it is not enabled by default, and cgi is not enabled
2014-11-10 07:00:52	Morgawr	alright
2014-11-10 07:00:56	jaycee	dhcp is not done by the isc dhcpd
2014-11-10 07:01:43	Happy-Ferret	bash is sh on a Mac, Morgawr.
2014-11-10 07:02:19	jaycee	according to my mac, they are seperate binaries
2014-11-10 07:02:22	Happy-Ferret	Strangely, they didn't link /bin/sh to /bin/bash, so there are two seperate versions of GNU Bash on there.
2014-11-10 07:02:40	jaycee	hm yes, interesting theyre both bash
2014-11-10 07:02:59	jaycee	different executable sizes though
2014-11-10 07:03:29	jaycee	ah, different code signing data sizes thats probably why

2014-11-10 07:14:49	jaycee	also not relevant
2014-11-10 07:15:21	jaycee	youre confusing open source idealism with development style

2014-11-10 07:17:27	Morgawr	jaycee: development style can be very tied to open source and the ability for people to drop in, provide patches/fixes, and get out
2014-11-10 07:20:23	jaycee	do you really think we work any differently on eON here at vp just because we're closed source?
2014-11-10 07:21:05	Happy-Ferret	jaycee: You work for vp? Neat!
2014-11-10 07:22:00	jaycee	i thought everyone knew that by now :)
2014-11-10 07:22:43	jaycee	same nick i got burnt with on the steam forums when we released w2 ;)
2014-11-10 07:23:12	Happy-Ferret	I didn't. Besides, I really didn't care about it too much. I knew it was going to improve, eventually.
2014-11-10 07:23:25	Happy-Ferret	Are you guys hiring, btw?
2014-11-10 07:24:21	mirv_	I know that if my work was open source, there would be things done very differently...but my work isn't related to gaming
2014-11-10 07:25:18	Morgawr	jaycee: I don't know how you work, but I'm fairly confident that yes, people would work differently if their projects were open source, at least there would be a bigger focus on integrating user patches from the outside world, maybe developing more documentation for the public and have a more open approach to bug tracking and feature requests
2014-11-10 07:25:23	Morgawr	but that's just me, I don't know
2014-11-10 07:25:58	Morgawr	here at Google the scale is so massive and everyone can jump into any other project so it's not that different from an "open source" approach (not considering the dozens of projects that are, indeed, open source) so I wouldn't know
2014-11-10 07:26:22	jaycee	Happy-Ferret, possibly ;)
2014-11-10 07:26:50	Happy-Ferret	I also didn't know Morgawr worked for Google, lol.
2014-11-10 07:27:00	Morgawr	Happy-Ferret: I'm just an intern
2014-11-10 07:27:40	Happy-Ferret	Was it very difficult to get there? I'm about to send my application for a position at Google Zurich.
2014-11-10 07:28:12	Happy-Ferret	jaycee: Probably UK only, eh? Or do you guys have offices on the continent?
2014-11-10 07:28:25	jaycee	most of us work from home :)
2014-11-10 07:28:38	Morgawr	Happy-Ferret: when I got out of bachelor I first applied (well, was contacted) for a full time position, I got through 3 phone interviews and I went to the on-site interviews in Dublin, it was 5 interviews (1 hour each) all in one morning and then quick back home
2014-11-10 07:28:42	Morgawr	it was super tiring
2014-11-10 07:28:51	Morgawr	unfortunately I didn't get the position back then (failed one interview on large scale design :( )
2014-11-10 07:29:04	Morgawr	so I just went on with my master's degree and during then I got offered the chance to apply for an internship
2014-11-10 07:29:21	Morgawr	for internship it's significantly easier (just 2 phone interviews) but since I had already done the "full package" of interviews, they just let me in for free
2014-11-10 07:29:46	Morgawr	after the internship you can go for conversion to become a full time employee with 2 interviews

2014-11-10 07:35:06	Morgawr	Happy-Ferret: we do get paid and I'd say it's quite a nice amount :)
2014-11-10 07:35:20	Morgawr	not as much as full time employee though :P
2014-11-10 07:36:16	Happy-Ferret	I guess I better not screw up my interview then. Lol.
2014-11-10 07:36:45	Morgawr	best of luck, lemme know if you need anything
2014-11-10 07:37:06	Morgawr	I plan to get a full time position either in Zurich or in Munich (depends on girlfriend though) in the future, who knows

2014-11-10 07:39:44	Morgawr	ah, I'm SRE
2014-11-10 07:39:58	Morgawr	lots of SWEs in Munich :D
2014-11-10 07:40:12	Morgawr	oh wait, you're Zurich
2014-11-10 07:40:16	Morgawr	lots of SWEs in Zurich too
2014-11-10 07:40:35	mirv_	SRE?
2014-11-10 07:40:43	Happy-Ferret	Site Reliability Engineer?
2014-11-10 07:41:10	Morgawr	yes
2014-11-10 07:41:25	Morgawr	aka make sure the infrastructure doesn't break
2014-11-10 07:42:19	Happy-Ferret	Hehe. That's actually what I'm graduating as. But I'd much rather work as Software Engineer, as that's where my whole passion rests.
2014-11-10 07:43:18	Morgawr	I didn't even know what SRE was but then the first recruiter told me "what do you prefer, SWE or SRE?" and since I Didn't want to study on algorithms and data structures and all that stuff I thought SRE would be more interesting :P
2014-11-10 07:43:23	Happy-Ferret	Only took that position at my current employer (Chamber of Crafts, Lake Constance) because my original training position at a software company was eradicated.
2014-11-10 07:43:26	Morgawr	since I prefer working with systems, at OS level, etc etc
2014-11-10 07:44:13	Happy-Ferret	Anyways. Zurich really beats Munich.
2014-11-10 07:44:47	Morgawr	idk, they are both very expensive (but salaries are adjusted accordingly, you won't be out of money that's for sure)
2014-11-10 07:44:50	mirv_	I prefer hardware, but I'm stuck with embedded software
2014-11-10 07:44:57	Morgawr	I heard Zurich is pretty grand as a location
2014-11-10 07:45:03	Morgawr	never been in either though, unfortunately
2014-11-10 07:45:04	Happy-Ferret	You can just move across the border and live in a small southern German town. Much cheaper than living in or around Munich
2014-11-10 07:45:23	Happy-Ferret	Zurich itself is a shithole, actually. Lol.
2014-11-10 07:45:59	Morgawr	friend of mine lived there for a year and he said it was pretty good :V
2014-11-10 07:46:17	Morgawr	but idk, honestly after living in Amsterdam all the other cities look bad to me :( I wish there was a Google office for SWE/SRE in Amsterdam
2014-11-10 07:46:26	Morgawr	atm I'm in Dublin but I miss Amsterdam
2014-11-10 07:46:51	Happy-Ferret	I live in Lottstetten, for one. Zurich is only a 30 minute commute from here, so I benefit from both, the Swiss job market and lower pricing for groceries in Germany.
2014-11-10 07:47:07	Morgawr	ah, cool
2014-11-10 07:49:05	Happy-Ferret	It's what most everyone does. I don't know of a single person here working in Germany (myself and other trainees excluded).
2014-11-10 07:49:27	Morgawr	I didn't know Zurich was that close to the border, it might be an interesting idea :P
2014-11-10 07:49:34	 *	Morgawr has never taken a good look at the map
2014-11-10 07:49:49	Morgawr	the big problems are 1) get hired for a full time position and 2) convince the missus
2014-11-10 07:49:55	Morgawr	and #2 sounds much harder to me than #1
2014-11-10 07:50:08	Morgawr	I already convinced her to move to amsterdam with me and now she likes it there :(
2014-11-10 07:55:08	Happy-Ferret	They probably have space brownies in Zurich too ;)
2014-11-10 07:55:57	Morgawr	heh, we're not in Amsterdam for drugs :P (weirdly enough)
2014-11-10 07:55:59	Morgawr	(nor hookers)
2014-11-10 07:56:02	Morgawr	(yet)
2014-11-10 07:57:39	Happy-Ferret	Possibly the no 1 reason to choose Zurich over Munich: They have better sleeping pods
2014-11-10 07:58:45	Morgawr	ahah, the relax room here in dublin is my favorite
2014-11-10 07:58:55	Morgawr	sometimes I go there to nap after lunch
2014-11-10 07:59:55	Happy-Ferret	My dream is to lock myself into one of those and spent one really productive week, without much outside influence.

2014-11-10 09:41:08	jaycee	kinda had to during witcher2 development as the 13.x series just wouldnt run it at all, and we had to get a beta driver from them that didnt lock up when we initialised our gl context :)
2014-11-10 09:41:37	Raven67854	Yeah well Ubuntu 14.10 has special driver that works with the xorg that 14.10 uses.

2014-11-10 14:12:20	jaycee	it is so fucking annoying when a game crashes, that your desktop res stays at whatever the game was
2014-11-10 14:12:26	jaycee	its so 1990s
2014-11-10 14:13:28	stqn	the "fake fullscreen" of SDL2 helped a lot with recent games I think, but it’s still the developer’s choice to use it or not
2014-11-10 14:13:40	Sik	I'm not even sure if Wayland lets you change the resolution
2014-11-10 14:13:48	Sik	I think it either centers the window or stretches it
2014-11-10 14:13:58	Sik	(so basically SDL2's fake fullscreen but enforced)
2014-11-10 14:14:37	jaycee	hm, thats actually a good point

2014-11-10 14:15:17	Sik	(in fact I think it only works properly at all on Windows, everywhere else it's buggy)
2014-11-10 14:15:32	stqn	Sik: well if you want to offer a lower resolution, but fullscreen, to your users, it’s the easiest way I suppose
2014-11-10 14:15:35	jaycee	does work on os x too but thats because os x does "fake fullscreen" in the OS
2014-11-10 14:15:45	Sik	(then again even Windows took a sweet time to get fullscreen working properly back in the day)
2014-11-10 14:16:11	jaycee	Sik, pretty much until windows 2000, then they got it right
2014-11-10 14:16:19	Sik	jaycee: when there's an OSX upgrade whether the method currently used by SDL2 still works or not is hit and miss
2014-11-10 14:16:44	jaycee	thats because theyre using some really old api's that were deprecated in 10.6 i think
2014-11-10 14:16:50	Sik	And proper fullscreen with resolution switching on Windows was introduced in Windows 98 I think
2014-11-10 14:17:05	jaycee	no, fullscreen on windows is still res switching
2014-11-10 14:17:08	jaycee	its just managed a lot better
2014-11-10 14:17:09	Sik	(more specifically, the flag that tells Windows that the resolution change is temporary and should be reverted if the process fails to do so on exit)
2014-11-10 14:17:26	Sik	(also it tells Windows to not rearrange icons)

2014-11-10 14:17:43	jaycee	yes thats it exactly, windows tracks what process changed screen res with DirectDraw/Direct3D, and if that process exits for any reason, it sets it back to the desktop res
2014-11-10 14:17:56	Sik	No, you can do it without DirectX as well
2014-11-10 14:18:22	jaycee	yep, but pretty much the only reason you would is to use GL
2014-11-10 14:18:25	Sik	So in theory it applies to OpenGL as well (or even GDI-based programs)
2014-11-10 14:18:32	jaycee	(we emulate both in eON)
2014-11-10 14:18:40	jaycee	and GDI is emulated now too as of XP i believe
2014-11-10 14:18:47	jaycee	might be as of vista
2014-11-10 14:18:49	Sik	No, I think that was in Vista
2014-11-10 14:19:08	Sik	XP still used old-school GDI I believe

2014-11-10 14:19:28	Sik	It becomes specially jarring in safe mode where it tries to scroll directly from VRAM
2014-11-10 14:19:49	Sik	(bandwidth gets in the way HARD)
2014-11-10 14:21:18	jaycee	well yeah, but it is safe mode :) probably akin to booting x11 with vesa
2014-11-10 14:21:32	jaycee	uefi needs to become mainstream and get rid of that crap
2014-11-10 14:22:36	Sik	Well yeah but e.g. Windows could have kept a copy of the framebuffer in RAM and copy it, or maybe just redraw the entire screen instead of trying to read from VRAM and then write back
2014-11-10 14:22:54	jaycee	too much hassle for a mode thats practically never used
2014-11-10 14:22:58	Sik	So yeah I assume it was the GDI code working like it had hardware acceleration enabled when it didn't
2014-11-10 14:23:13	jaycee	especially now you dont even really need to reboot for graphics driver updates
2014-11-10 14:23:16	Sik	(with hardware help it definitely is not an issue)
2014-11-10 14:24:14	Sik	I guess Vista onwards just keeps a framebuffer in RAM and then blits it all in safe mode (never used those Windows versions so I can't tell)
2014-11-10 14:24:31	Sik	Not having to read from VRAM definitely would speed up things
2014-11-10 14:24:32	jaycee	vista/7/8 is entirely composited eys
2014-11-10 14:24:53	Sik	Even in safe mode? :P (though I thought GDI was software rendered when not using Direct2D?)
2014-11-10 14:25:17	jaycee	in software mode it probably just uses some software blitters yeah
2014-11-10 14:25:27	Sik	Actually I need to look up how GDI works now, I don't remember if it just software rendered then used D2D to blit or if it used D2D to render everything
2014-11-10 14:25:48	Sik	But yeah
2014-11-10 14:26:02	Sik	Point is XP was still using the old-school GDI rendering method
2014-11-10 14:26:16	jaycee	thats one of the big secrets of eon. we dont bother emulating gdi ;)
2014-11-10 14:26:23	jaycee	well, not much of it
2014-11-10 14:27:10	Sik	I think the worst implementation of GDI came from pre-1.6 Wine
2014-11-10 14:27:17	Sik	Every single GDI command was sent as-is to X
2014-11-10 14:27:25	Sik	Cue rendering a toolbar taking up several seconds
2014-11-10 14:27:46	jaycee	yeah, we dont do any of that, we barely do any UI stuff at all, because most games just dont use it
2014-11-10 14:28:06	jaycee	thats the main difference between us and wine
2014-11-10 14:28:15	jaycee	wine is trying to emulate every windows subsystem as accurately as it can
2014-11-10 14:28:21	jaycee	we just emulate API that games need
2014-11-10 14:28:28	Sik	I barely use Wine anyway, I think the only usual GUI program I use with Wine is GraphicsGale
2014-11-10 14:28:38	Sik	asm68k is command line, and everything else is games
2014-11-10 14:28:39	jaycee	unless we have to, we dont bother emulating the internals of windows either

2014-11-10 14:32:46	Sik	I think that what happened that time is that the YM2612 crashed which in turn hung up the Z80 when it tried to use it which in turn hung up the 68000 which was expecting a response from the Z80...

2014-11-11 03:40:02	jaycee	but then again we've had plenty of "youre lame for not making 64 bit builds"
2014-11-11 03:40:20	jaycee	why the fuck does it matter, a 64 bit machine can run 32 bit stuff. being 64 bit wont make it magically faster

2014-11-11 03:41:00	mirv_	jaycee, in some cases it can, but that's more because of assumptions about the underlying architecture than being 64bit
2014-11-11 03:41:15	jaycee	its probably the case that the original game was 64 bit, so they arent going to go to the hassle of making a 32 bit build
2014-11-11 03:41:21	von	running a 64 bit machine will allow me run both 32 and 64 bit software while running 32 bit will restrict me to only 32 bit. That's basically not even a choice for me lol.

2014-11-11 03:49:13	jaycee	usually because they both put headers in /usr/include
2014-11-11 03:49:33	jaycee	stupid thing is i'd be willing to bet in 90% of cases, the headers are identical between the two

2014-11-11 10:28:09	Raven67854	EU's vat sucks
2014-11-11 10:28:29	DrMcCoy	At least I get to see final prices including VAT everywhere I go
2014-11-11 10:28:40	Raven67854	Well that's nice
2014-11-11 10:28:54	DrMcCoy	I was in the US for a long weekend, and it was very confusing only seeing prices without VAT everywhere
2014-11-11 10:29:09	Raven67854	haha
2014-11-11 10:29:40	DrMcCoy	Big sign says $9.99. Then at the checkout, it's more and I get annoyed looks because I gave a $10 bill

2014-11-11 10:30:27	Raven67854	Because sales tax is different everywhere
2014-11-11 10:30:48	DrMcCoy	It was a brick and mortar store!
2014-11-11 10:30:53	Raven67854	So?
2014-11-11 10:30:58	Raven67854	sales tax is different everywhere
2014-11-11 10:31:12	Raven67854	Counties/City's can have different sales tax from each other
2014-11-11 10:31:31	DrMcCoy	Yes, but when I'm physically there, and see a physical sign that wasn't moved for a decade
2014-11-11 10:31:50	Raven67854	I still don't see the issue
2014-11-11 10:32:07	DrMcCoy	It's transparency 101
2014-11-11 10:32:10	Raven67854	That's just bitching to bitch. So it's all tallied at the end it makes no difference in the end. So it didn't say $10.12 or whatever it ended up beeing
2014-11-11 10:32:15	Raven67854	Except people from here know what it is
2014-11-11 10:32:25	Raven67854	So it's not really a transparency issue
2014-11-11 10:32:27	mirv_	that's damned confusing
2014-11-11 10:32:32	Raven67854	mirv_, can be
2014-11-11 10:32:35	mirv_	just write how much it costs
2014-11-11 10:32:39	jaycee	why not just put it on the sign in the first place
2014-11-11 10:32:50	jaycee	doesnt cause us any hassle doing that here in the UK
2014-11-11 10:33:01	DrMcCoy	Well, if I only have a certain amount with me, I have to additionally look out for taxes while tallying up the prices in the store
2014-11-11 10:33:12	Raven67854	Most places are 5%
2014-11-11 10:33:12	DrMcCoy	Or hell, when I want to give exact change at the checkout
2014-11-11 10:33:13	Raven67854	well
2014-11-11 10:33:17	Raven67854	unless you're in a big city
2014-11-11 10:33:23	Raven67854	Sales taxes can be worse their
2014-11-11 10:34:42	DrMcCoy	I mean, Germany has different taxes on different products. 19% on general goods, 7% on foodstuff
2014-11-11 10:34:51	Raven67854	That is ridiculous
2014-11-11 10:35:09	DrMcCoy	And yet, all prices you see in the store (and everywhere) are including tax
2014-11-11 10:35:18	Raven67854	Okay
2014-11-11 10:35:21	Raven67854	I don't see the issue
2014-11-11 10:35:29	DrMcCoy	The price you see is the price you fork over at the end
2014-11-11 10:35:35	jaycee	yep
2014-11-11 10:35:35	Raven67854	I'm aware
2014-11-11 10:35:37	jaycee	how it should be
2014-11-11 10:35:38	Raven67854	I still don't see the issue
2014-11-11 10:35:44	Raven67854	Because it makes no real difference in the end
2014-11-11 10:36:01	jaycee	the only places that generally show ex vat in the UK are places selling to businesses who are likely to be VAT registered
2014-11-11 10:36:05	jaycee	wholesalers and such
2014-11-11 10:36:09	mirv_	Raven67854, it does if you're trying to figure out how much you're going to pay before you hit the checkout
2014-11-11 10:36:11	DrMcCoy	It's an extra thing you have to keep in mind. It's an extra thing that makes the prices seem lower than they are
2014-11-11 10:36:16	jaycee	and generally, they show both prices anyway
2014-11-11 10:36:20	Raven67854	I've never thought about it
2014-11-11 10:36:31	Raven67854	but I haven't paid with cash in years
2014-11-11 10:36:48	jaycee	another concept i find odd is having to do your own tax return on your wages
2014-11-11 10:36:54	jaycee	sure, fine if youre self employed or so
2014-11-11 10:37:02	Raven67854	ugh
2014-11-11 10:37:04	DrMcCoy	Well, okay, Germans like to pay cash
2014-11-11 10:37:05	jaycee	but if you work for a company, they should do it for you
2014-11-11 10:37:06	Raven67854	please don't bring taxes up
2014-11-11 10:37:25	Raven67854	I have to do taxes again
2014-11-11 10:38:15	Raven67854	Don't even want to think about taxes until Feb haha

2014-11-11 14:50:22	von	my steam account says I've been running it for 33 hours, I'd say it's more like 25~28, so about 6 to 7 hours per playthrough
2014-11-11 14:50:56	von	maybe even less
2014-11-11 14:55:26	Morgawr	Massive Chalice seems pretty good so far

2014-11-11 16:35:10	Raven67854	But it's clearly worth slightly more than $15 =)

2014-11-11 16:36:18	Raven67854	The very first computer I can think of us as a kid in my house had a pentuim pro

2014-11-11 16:47:13	jaycee	1980 here, you bloody kids :P
2014-11-11 16:47:45	jaycee	we had 16K of ram and games took 20 minutes to load off tape, AND WE LIKED IT :P

2014-11-11 16:47:57	stqn	eheh
2014-11-11 16:48:13	stqn	the game that took the longest time to load for me was chicago 90, needed 15 minutes
2014-11-11 16:48:39	stqn	others needed much less time
2014-11-11 16:48:41	jaycee	yeah it was usually only 5 minutes, just seemed like 20 ;)
2014-11-11 16:48:57	jaycee	assuming it loaded the first time :)
2014-11-11 16:49:11	Raven67854	I load games in about 10 seconds sometimes less
2014-11-11 16:49:14	jaycee	R Tape loading error, 0:1
2014-11-11 16:49:30	Raven67854	I love my computer
2014-11-11 16:49:34	stqn	but thanks to Nordic Games we can have long loading times again!
2014-11-11 16:49:36	Raven67854	Not sure I wanna go back to the old days
2014-11-11 16:49:46	Raven67854	stqn, Long load times?
2014-11-11 16:50:42	stqn	yeah. Just ranting again about Deadfall Adventures.
2014-11-11 16:50:50	Raven67854	I've never played it
2014-11-11 16:52:14	stqn	The game is ok, but not good enough for me to bear the 6 minutes loading time.
2014-11-11 16:52:28	Raven67854	Would it fit onto a ram drive?
2014-11-11 16:52:33	Raven67854	32gb ram drive to be exact?
2014-11-11 16:52:42	stqn	ahah… probably.
2014-11-11 16:52:47	Raven67854	wonder if that'd help
2014-11-11 16:52:53	stqn	but I think it’s shaders compiling.
2014-11-11 16:53:00	Raven67854	Oh unreal
2014-11-11 16:53:02	Raven67854	?
2014-11-11 16:53:02	jaycee	depends if its spending that long doing io, yeah
2014-11-11 16:53:34	Raven67854	jaycee, I didn't think about shader compiling. I haven't come across that as an issue on Linux but yeah. That would be a hell of an annoying issue
2014-11-11 16:54:14	stqn	5.8G	Deadfall Adventures
2014-11-11 16:55:16	jaycee	we have translation of directx shader opcodes into glsl in eon, i came across an interesting gl extension lately too
2014-11-11 16:55:42	jaycee	GL_ARB_get_program_binary
2014-11-11 16:55:47	jaycee	lets you save out the compiled program in its bytecode form
2014-11-11 16:55:55	jaycee	hardware specific, of course
2014-11-11 16:56:07	DrMcCoy	Probably driver version specific too
2014-11-11 16:56:15	jaycee	aye quite likely
2014-11-11 16:56:19	jaycee	but great for caching
2014-11-11 16:57:01	DrMcCoy	Doesn't nvidia already cache by its own?
2014-11-11 16:57:16	stqn	that’s what I don’t understand, I though the nvidia blob automatically cached shaders
2014-11-11 16:57:22	DrMcCoy	At least I have an ~/.nv/GLCache/ folder here that keeps popping up
2014-11-11 16:57:25	jaycee	yeah, its an nvidia developed extension actually
2014-11-11 16:57:27	stqn	DrMcCoy: yeah
2014-11-11 16:57:42	jaycee	i suppose its still better if the game does it itself
2014-11-11 16:58:17	stqn	so perhaps it’s not shaders that take so much time for deadfall… or they are changing them so that the cache doesn’t work?
2014-11-11 16:58:20	jaycee	we already do a CRC of the incoming directx shader, and see if we already translated it to GLSL, can just as easily see if we have a cacehed version too
2014-11-11 16:58:35	DrMcCoy	I wonder if there's a way to RE them...
2014-11-11 16:59:20	DrMcCoy	Or modify them
2014-11-11 17:03:11	DrMcCoy	Well, I know nothing about the internal representation of shaders, though. At all :P

2014-11-11 18:30:56	stqn	I was so disappointed by creeper world 3
2014-11-11 18:31:05	Raven67854	It was okay!
2014-11-11 18:31:09	Raven67854	I know what you mean but I was okay with it
2014-11-11 18:31:23	stqn	spent many hours on the previous flash games, but that one… :(
2014-11-11 18:31:59	DrMcCoy	Planet Stronghold is okay, if you like weird Visual Novel / Strategy hybrids in Ren'Py :P
2014-11-11 18:32:19	stqn	yeah I played the demo… I think I bought the full game too, not sure
2014-11-11 18:32:45	stqn	yes
2014-11-11 18:34:12	DrMcCoy	err, turn-based RPG, not Strategy
2014-11-11 18:34:20	DrMcCoy	JRPG style combat
2014-11-11 18:34:54	Raven67854	Playing secrets of mana at the moment
2014-11-11 18:34:59	Raven67854	I played this game so much as a kid
2014-11-11 18:37:01	DrMcCoy	I was more of a text adventure, graphic adventure, western RPG kid
2014-11-11 18:37:16	Raven67854	I liked a lot of games
2014-11-11 18:37:22	Raven67854	like*
2014-11-11 18:37:38	Raven67854	Western RPG's are great
2014-11-11 18:37:43	Raven67854	but Square made some damn amazing RPG's
2014-11-11 18:38:12	DrMcCoy	I only had an original Gameboy, no NES/SNES
2014-11-11 18:38:29	DrMcCoy	Lots of Tetris love
2014-11-11 18:38:30	Raven67854	haha my gameboy
2014-11-11 18:38:34	Raven67854	had tetris and pokemon
2014-11-11 18:38:38	DrMcCoy	Ducktales
2014-11-11 18:38:52	DrMcCoy	Mario 1 and 2; and Wario Land
2014-11-11 18:39:03	Raven67854	I also played the hell out of super mario world
2014-11-11 18:39:23	DrMcCoy	I never got the hand of Megaman
2014-11-11 18:39:25	DrMcCoy	hang*
2014-11-11 18:39:35	Raven67854	Honestly I still don't like the original megaman
2014-11-11 18:39:39	Raven67854	It's great and all but it's just not me
2014-11-11 18:40:01	Raven67854	I also had Zelda for NES and Metal Gear
2014-11-11 18:40:30	DrMcCoy	:)
2014-11-11 18:40:45	Raven67854	remember getting Zelda for SNES and was super pissed about that
2014-11-11 18:41:03	Raven67854	Oh! And mario legend of the seven stars
2014-11-11 18:41:04	Raven67854	Fuck yes
2014-11-11 18:41:09	Raven67854	a TBS mario RPG that was damn nice
2014-11-11 18:42:09	Raven67854	Fucking wario in that game
2014-11-11 18:42:11	Raven67854	Damn asshole
2014-11-11 18:43:38	DrMcCoy	lol
2014-11-11 18:44:12	Raven67854	it's funny that they built that entire game and it's only 4mb in size
2014-11-11 18:44:13	stqn	I think Square are the worse game developers in the world, ever.
2014-11-11 18:44:19	Raven67854	yes they're now
2014-11-11 18:44:25	Raven67854	But back then they made some damn nice games
2014-11-11 18:44:49	DrMcCoy	4mb is a lot
2014-11-11 18:44:51	Raven67854	They lost their way.. signed deals with Micrrosoft
2014-11-11 18:44:55	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, Fuck no it isn't
2014-11-11 18:45:02	stqn	That was a bit of a trolling attempt, but … I don’t understand the hype.
2014-11-11 18:45:03	DrMcCoy	yes it is
2014-11-11 18:45:19	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, yeah maybe in 1996 :P
2014-11-11 18:45:22	Raven67854	or 1991
2014-11-11 18:45:30	stqn	I played FF1 and it was ok for an old game, but very repetitive and crappy story.
2014-11-11 18:45:49	Raven67854	stqn, Have you played any other FF?
2014-11-11 18:45:54	Raven67854	And they made other RPG's besides FF
2014-11-11 18:46:46	DrMcCoy	wasn't there some renumbering with th FF games?
2014-11-11 18:46:48	stqn	I tried 6 but it was just too bad, then… I don’t remember the name, something on the PSP, it was just too bad, too.
2014-11-11 18:47:12	Raven67854	They made Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Secrets of series, Xenogears, etc..
2014-11-11 18:47:24	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, Sorta
2014-11-11 18:47:32	stqn	Then I played FF13, completely broken camera, poor tutorial, story that doesn’t make sense.
2014-11-11 18:47:33	DrMcCoy	US FF1 == JPN FF3 or something?
2014-11-11 18:47:44	Raven67854	stqn, yeah 13 is awful
2014-11-11 18:47:55	Raven67854	Really 10 is the last good FF though some people like 12
2014-11-11 18:48:09	stqn	(But I finished it after being pushed by a friend to play it over and over.)
2014-11-11 18:48:10	Raven67854	13 is okay it's just way to linear and it doesn't feel like Final Fantasy
2014-11-11 18:48:30	stqn	(He also explained many things and I had to search info on the web to understand how to play.)
2014-11-11 18:48:45	Raven67854	13's biggest issue is that damn story
2014-11-11 18:48:50	Raven67854	It barely makes any sense
2014-11-11 18:49:07	DrMcCoy	fell-zee and la-zee and no one makes a damn sense
2014-11-11 18:49:23	DrMcCoy	and so much teenage angst
2014-11-11 18:49:31	stqn	The worst thing about 13 is … well, everything except the characters’ graphics IMO ;)
2014-11-11 18:49:32	Raven67854	Yep
2014-11-11 18:49:38	Raven67854	I really like FF9
2014-11-11 18:49:55	Raven67854	And the MMO's are good but eh gotta like MMO's for that
2014-11-11 18:51:16	stqn	Although perhaps I’m being too harsh, after all that game kept me from being bored for 50+ hours.
2014-11-11 18:51:25	Raven67854	I think people really hate the FF series
2014-11-11 18:51:27	Raven67854	Kinda like cod
2014-11-11 18:51:31	Raven67854	some people just hate it purely just because
2014-11-11 18:51:59	Raven67854	Also I don't really feel Final Fantasy games appeal to a lot of people
2014-11-11 18:52:07	Raven67854	They're slow and time consuming
2014-11-11 18:52:28	Raven67854	I also really liked Final Fantasy Tactics
2014-11-11 18:52:33	Raven67854	but that game wow fuck that game sometimes

2014-11-12 14:31:07	guig33k	ok thx
2014-11-12 14:31:34	Happy-Ferret	If all else fails, just create a symbolic link.
2014-11-12 14:32:16	FutureSuture	Hmmm, Steam really is convenient, von.
2014-11-12 14:32:28	von	I agree
2014-11-12 14:33:06	FutureSuture	Big fan of GOG and its policies, but in order to attract n00bs like me, it best be easier than that.
2014-11-12 14:34:10	Happy-Ferret	Well. Noobs probably shouldn't run non-LTS releases of Ubuntu.
2014-11-12 14:34:40	Happy-Ferret	Especially when they're still fresh.
2014-11-12 14:36:59	guig33k	it s working
2014-11-12 14:37:01	guig33k	now
2014-11-12 14:37:15	guig33k	but i dont understand why gog not give us the list of the dependencies
2014-11-12 14:37:32	stqn	guig33k: report the bug
2014-11-12 14:38:08	guig33k	i have report it and say that it will be nice it gave to us dependencies
2014-11-12 14:38:08	stqn	sloppy work on their part
2014-11-12 14:38:43	stqn	(well maybe it’s sloppy work on the part of the M&B devs, I dunno :) )
2014-11-12 14:38:47	von	btw, guig33k

2014-11-12 14:38:51	von	was it a deb package or just a tarball?
2014-11-12 14:38:56	guig33k	deb
2014-11-12 14:39:46	Happy-Ferret	Well. Then again, non-LTS.
2014-11-12 14:39:46	FutureSuture	mirv_, give me the attention I deserve.
2014-11-12 14:39:46	von	then not including the dependencies is unacceptable
2014-11-12 14:40:01	von	the only positive side to using the package for something as big as a videogame is to be able to get all the deps automatically
2014-11-12 14:41:02	Happy-Ferret	I don't think too many devs specifically test their games on releases that are only supported for 9 months and are supposed to give developers and hardcore users insights, more than anything else.
2014-11-12 14:43:08	stqn	I don’t think libcurl and libglew (32 bit versions) are installed by default on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit)
2014-11-12 14:43:08	stqn	if they aren’t on 14.10
2014-11-12 14:43:08	mirv_	FutureSuture, back now
2014-11-12 14:43:08	mirv_	ah, hope, yes
2014-11-12 14:43:08	stqn	(assuming that’s what guig33k is using, IDK)
2014-11-12 14:43:08	mirv_	FutureSuture, the boss has to write a letter of intent (to continue employment)
2014-11-12 14:43:08	mirv_	and he should be doing it in the next days
2014-11-12 14:43:08	mirv_	so I can apply by the end of November for a visa (have 3 months to move if I get it)

2014-11-12 14:45:35	disharmonic	script and apt-gets
2014-11-12 14:46:20	stqn	or ship the libs
2014-11-12 14:46:20	von	but seriously, deb package has Depends: field

2014-11-12 14:46:20	von	it's the only reason to use the bloody ugly thing in the first place xD
2014-11-12 14:47:13	Happy-Ferret	yea. true
2014-11-12 14:48:26	Happy-Ferret	Errr. Odd question. Does anyone know what file chsh writes to? Would really like to know how this whole changing shell mechanism works and whether there's a way to do it manually.
2014-11-12 14:48:26	FutureSuture	mirv_, ah, I see. I interpreted as "Cannot wait to leave Germany and settle down in the UK!"
2014-11-12 14:48:26	FutureSuture	German has much better Linux offerings than the UK, I've observed.
2014-11-12 14:50:00	FutureSuture	As well as offerings without an operating system.
2014-11-12 14:50:00	stqn	It seems that the same games keep on showing up in the GoL sales RSS feed.
2014-11-12 14:50:00	mirv_	FutureSuture, it's complicated a little for me
2014-11-12 14:50:00	mirv_	I can't earn money on the side here (work contract won't really let me, without permission)
2014-11-12 14:50:00	mirv_	and my gf can't find work here

2014-11-13 00:53:08	FutureSuture	mirv_, no, I only care about dedicated GPUs D:
2014-11-13 00:53:56	mirv_	can't do radeonsi with that, sorry
2014-11-13 00:55:49	mirv_	although I'm curious how much a 290x costs right now...
2014-11-13 00:57:29	mirv_	350Euro, give or take
2014-11-13 00:57:32	mirv_	yeah....no, not right now
2014-11-13 00:58:51	mirv_	8GB 290X for 670Euro
2014-11-13 01:00:12	mirv_	I need to earn more
2014-11-13 01:09:18	NuSuey	ah, morning everyone..
2014-11-13 01:10:23	NuSuey	any suggestions for a browser with better memory management than chrome/chromium?
2014-11-13 01:11:23	Piratelv	internet explorer
2014-11-13 01:12:23	mirv_	NuSuey, links2
2014-11-13 01:12:52	NuSuey	you asses
2014-11-13 01:13:07	NuSuey	Piratelv: Kill it with fire!
2014-11-13 01:13:20	mirv_	I use firefox aurora channel personally
2014-11-13 01:13:38	Piratelv	NuSuey: But But it's so light! It ses on avarage 0mb ram since I never dare to use it
2014-11-13 01:14:49	Piratelv	I hear midori is light and fast, It does crash a lot with me though
2014-11-13 01:16:56	NuSuey	yup. it does.. :X
2014-11-13 01:17:51	NuSuey	something with multi-os support? opera is now almost the same as chromium, isn't it?
2014-11-13 01:18:40	Piratelv	it uses the blink engine from chrome yes
2014-11-13 01:18:50	NuSuey	damn..

2014-11-13 01:21:48	FutureSuture	mirv_, 290X cards seem to go as cheap as 250€
2014-11-13 01:23:05	FutureSuture	mirv_, nevermind, stupidly named 290. Cheapest 290X is 290€.
2014-11-13 01:23:32	Dezponia	I'm looking forward to the 300 series
2014-11-13 01:24:07	mirv_	my planned upgrade is after I get to the UK
2014-11-13 01:24:13	FutureSuture	Dezponia, which is coming sometime in the first half of 2015
2014-11-13 01:24:19	Dezponia	FutureSuture: Yepp
2014-11-13 01:25:12	Dezponia	Looking to pick up something along the lines of the second-to-best card in an 8GB VRAM version (because then I can poke fun at the consols, having the same VRAM as they got total system RAM, not any other reason really)
2014-11-13 01:26:24	FutureSuture	mirv_, ever since the UK increased VAT, Germany works out cheaper for hardware
2014-11-13 01:26:43	mirv_	FutureSuture, well I'll be visiting Berlin on a semi-regular basis
2014-11-13 01:26:57	FutureSuture	Dezponia, I have waited long enough, will just get a 980 and get back to gaming.
2014-11-13 01:28:23	Dezponia	FutureSuture: I'll be getting an Nvidia card as well then I get the 300
2014-11-13 01:28:31	mirv_	if you can find a cheap radeon6950, get one
2014-11-13 01:28:41	Dezponia	Run them side by side and just use the motherboard to disable the PCI-E slots when I want to switch between them
2014-11-13 01:28:54	mirv_	otherwise, right this instant for gaming, and if you don't mind blobs, nvidia is a better option it seems
2014-11-13 01:29:27	Dezponia	mirv_: I do mind blobs and thats why I want to follow along with the new open AMD driver and see how it develops :)
2014-11-13 01:29:47	Dezponia	mirv_: Not that AMD is flawless since they have their firmware but its an improvement
2014-11-13 01:30:23	mirv_	Dezponia, everyone has firmware microcode though
2014-11-13 01:30:34	FutureSuture	mirv_, if I could buy a 6970 in a store, I would
2014-11-13 01:30:45	jaycee_	amd at least provide the firmware in files for use
2014-11-13 01:30:53	jaycee_	nvidia have it embedded in the driver i think
2014-11-13 01:30:58	jaycee_	or do they have it in rom.. cant remember
2014-11-13 01:31:11	mirv_	FutureSuture, let me see how well a cheap card (280x or something) stacks up against a 6950...
2014-11-13 01:31:25	mirv_	FutureSuture, because I might be convinced to part with mine if it's stacks up well
2014-11-13 01:31:35	jaycee_	i tried buying a 6xxx series card recently. forget it, unless you want to buy a used one
2014-11-13 01:32:00	mirv_	they are an older card now
2014-11-13 01:32:19	mirv_	just a pity, because the 6950 in particular was excellent for performance and power usage
2014-11-13 01:32:29	jaycee_	well even the 7xxx series is obsolete, mostly just stockists clearing their existing stock now
2014-11-13 01:32:50	Dezponia	jaycee_: In driver. But they MIGHT be changing that. Or at least they've discussed a license that would allow nouveau to ship the firmware. This because they've recently made changes so the 900 series cards and forward have signed firmware
2014-11-13 01:33:19	jaycee_	the firmware doesnt really need to be open source anyway
2014-11-13 01:33:29	jaycee_	you upload it to the gpu and forget about it...
2014-11-13 01:33:29	FutureSuture	jaycee_, don't do used, thanks for the heads up
2014-11-13 01:34:06	Dezponia	All firmware needs to be free software
2014-11-13 01:34:28	jaycee_	no it doesnt
2014-11-13 01:34:29	Dezponia	Not a matter of practical problems but ethical ones
2014-11-13 01:34:52	jaycee_	how far dyou want to go with that
2014-11-13 01:34:53	FutureSuture	mirv_, in recent Phoronix tests with AMD's open source driver, the 6950 was only beaten by a 290. He did not have a 280X, though
2014-11-13 01:35:00	Dezponia	jaycee_: 100%
2014-11-13 01:35:03	jaycee_	should they have to open source the hardware design as well?
2014-11-13 01:35:07	Dezponia	Yes
2014-11-13 01:35:12	mirv_	FutureSuture, yeah, radeonsi needs improving
2014-11-13 01:35:14	jaycee_	should intel have to release the lithography of the cpu's ?
2014-11-13 01:35:20	Dezponia	Yes
2014-11-13 01:35:27	jaycee_	then youre crazy tbh
2014-11-13 01:35:29	jaycee_	it wont happen
2014-11-13 01:35:36	jaycee_	trade secrets exist, like it or not
2014-11-13 01:35:58	Dezponia	Of course it wont right now. Just saying they should because it is the ethical thing to do
2014-11-13 01:36:07	jaycee_	not really
2014-11-13 01:36:10	jaycee_	99% of people dont care
2014-11-13 01:36:13	jaycee_	and dont need to care
2014-11-13 01:36:39	Dezponia	Well I wont change your mind and you wont change mine
2014-11-13 01:36:40	jaycee_	its not as if you could take a design from intel or whoever and fabricate it yourself
2014-11-13 01:37:04	FutureSuture	80 frames per second in CS:GO at 2560x1600 with a 290 is not bad, though.
2014-11-13 01:37:53	mirv_	FutureSuture, most of the bog down is in shader performance these days
2014-11-13 01:38:09	Dezponia	FutureSuture: Yepp. Thats impressive. I wonder how stabel it is and if there are any render bugs
2014-11-13 01:38:12	jaycee_	thing is thats pretty much the #2 important feature
2014-11-13 01:38:24	jaycee_	shaders do everything these days
2014-11-13 01:38:44	mirv_	jaycee_, yeah, but I'm not sure how complex cs:go is with shaders
2014-11-13 01:38:49	mirv_	I don't have the game
2014-11-13 01:39:38	mirv_	I'd be more interested in UE4 based games
2014-11-13 01:39:51	mirv_	and, obviously, TW2
2014-11-13 01:43:58	FutureSuture	Means a 290X running CS:GO at 2560x1440 should have even higher frames per second.
2014-11-13 01:44:24	FutureSuture	Unless that kind of logic doed not work with the open source driver
2014-11-13 01:45:55	jaycee_	id be happy if amd's new driver only supported GCN and newer as long as they bloody well do something

2014-11-13 01:49:15	mirv_	jaycee_, I think the idea is only GCN1.1, or maybe only for new hardware and onwards
2014-11-13 01:50:42	mirv_	yes, only future hardware generations apparently
2014-11-13 01:51:15	jaycee_	as long as they give specs for the old crap i guess
2014-11-13 01:51:28	jaycee_	and they support the APUs
2014-11-13 01:51:40	mirv_	yeah
2014-11-13 01:52:21	mirv_	the open drivers will catch up to fglrx with all current hardware, eventually
2014-11-13 01:52:38	FutureSuture	If the code is open source across all 3 platforms, then sure. AMD's stuff being open source on Linux is a key selling point.
2014-11-13 01:52:43	mirv_	for pre-radeonsi there's almost no reason to fglrx at all now
2014-11-13 01:52:56	mirv_	*to use
2014-11-13 01:53:09	jaycee_	mirv_, is it definitely as-good-or-better performance ?
2014-11-13 01:53:33	FutureSuture	mirv_, is r600 still getting improved or is it just radeonsi now?
2014-11-13 01:53:44	mirv_	jaycee_, for most of what I've run, r600 is equal, or maybe 90% performance of fglrx
2014-11-13 01:53:59	mirv_	FutureSuture, it does, but not as much as radeonsi now
2014-11-13 01:54:03	jaycee_	when its 100-120% i'll be happy ;)
2014-11-13 01:54:35	mirv_	there is in fact only one thing keeping me booting fglrx on the desktop at all now
2014-11-13 01:54:45	mirv_	fans still spin up more with mesa
2014-11-13 01:54:57	jaycee_	i remember when we first tested witcher2 on the catalyst 13.x series.. opengl 2.1 path got about 15fps... opengl3.2 path got... um, 5fps and broken rendering
2014-11-13 01:55:05	mirv_	they really need to fix the dynamic power management
2014-11-13 01:55:56	mirv_	yeah, they fixed up a boatload since then, but still have a ways to go

2014-11-13 01:57:41	jaycee_	and i still say that i reckon the only reason witcher2 is faster on wine under amd is simply because catalyst has been optimised to whatever data wine puts out

2014-11-13 01:59:17	jaycee_	mirv_, well, we had amd look at our game and they analysed the callstream coming out of it.. and after a week they said "we have no idea why its slower, it should be faster, your callstream is more efficient than WINEs"
2014-11-13 01:59:53	mirv_	liamdawe, thumbs up!
2014-11-13 02:00:08	NuSuey	liamdawe: I like it

2014-11-13 02:01:02	mirv_	if they're anything like me, they won't be able to sleep until they can explain it
2014-11-13 02:01:04	jaycee_	mirv_, well they told us they already improved performance 30% in some internal development driver
2014-11-13 02:01:28	jaycee_	when i asked them when that'd be released... they went quiet
2014-11-13 02:01:50	mirv_	they could at least say what they're waiting for to release it
2014-11-13 02:02:06	jaycee_	id settle for them telling us why WINE is faster so we could go that way tbh
2014-11-13 02:02:37	NuSuey	btw, is there a way / an app which would enable me to .. upload new images in the directory somewhere, maybe even post a twitter/tumblr post with the image? or is that too much?:P
2014-11-13 02:06:11	mirv_	damn it, why do companies keep asking me to fix their AES implementations?

2014-11-13 02:28:14	NuSuey	don't have to post these one by one
2014-11-13 02:31:48	mirv_	FutureSuture, it's definitely true that blobs have hacks internally to get extra performance
2014-11-13 02:31:54	NuSuey	there is never enough cyanide & happiness in my life
2014-11-13 02:32:07	mirv_	so open source might indeed never see the same level of performance across every program
2014-11-13 02:32:57	mirv_	jaycee_, Gladman's code is for a PC, or at least something with more than 4kB of ram space
2014-11-13 02:33:20	jaycee_	mirv_, he does have a byte-oriented decoder with no tables which should be good for microcontroller use

2014-11-13 02:35:34	mirv_	a little too much overhead for our particular setup
2014-11-13 02:35:49	mirv_	not much, mind you, but enough
2014-11-13 02:36:23	mirv_	what I ended up writing is very, very similar
2014-11-13 02:37:08	mirv_	and then later discarded because the CC430 has a hardware AES module
2014-11-13 02:38:41	jaycee_	even better :) id imagine theyre pretty cheap by now
2014-11-13 02:39:12	mirv_	when you order 10k at a time, yeah
2014-11-13 02:39:29	mirv_	they have some interesting errata though

2014-11-13 03:04:58	jaycee_	right, probably the driver causing the abort
2014-11-13 03:05:13	jaycee_	or the driver did something daft and we hit an assert as a result

2014-11-13 03:08:04	mirv_	definitely driver somewhere
2014-11-13 03:08:15	mirv_	I'll try again without forcing s3tc enabled, just because
2014-11-13 03:08:39	jaycee_	youll probably need s3tc support and formats derived from it
2014-11-13 03:10:41	mirv_	yep, but it actually loads now
2014-11-13 03:10:49	jaycee_	heh
2014-11-13 03:11:00	jaycee_	just renders with stuff missing?
2014-11-13 03:11:04	mirv_	yep
2014-11-13 03:11:28	jaycee_	ive always wondered why mesa has to include anything to do with s3tc in the driver tbh
2014-11-13 03:11:41	mirv_	oh, ok, yes that could be it
2014-11-13 03:11:43	jaycee_	i wouldve imagined decompression was down to the hardware
2014-11-13 03:12:05	mirv_	maybe it would help if my last rebuild actually had the 32bit libtxc_dxtn
2014-11-13 03:12:14	jaycee_	heh ok :)
2014-11-13 03:12:23	mirv_	was thinking it was a bit odd
2014-11-13 03:12:55	mirv_	stupid patent crap
2014-11-13 03:13:51	jaycee_	like i said i dont get why they have to have software implementation of s3tc at all
2014-11-13 03:15:25	jaycee_	thats kinda the whole point, you store the S3TC/DXTn compressed texture in VRAM, and the hardware decompresses it on the fly
2014-11-13 03:16:20	jaycee_	so it seems to me that mesa doesnt actually support it in hardware, and theyre using software to work around it. which is silly
2014-11-13 03:17:25	mirv_	yeah, it's a bit strange
2014-11-13 03:17:40	mirv_	not sure what they do with it internally
2014-11-13 03:17:53	jaycee_	also VIA dont seem to care about it being patented or not, its probably just something they bought when they bought out S3 and they dont really care about it
2014-11-13 03:18:29	jaycee_	but well, decompressing S3TC/DXTn into VRAM completely defeats the point of the format
2014-11-13 03:18:36	mirv_	I think nobody should care about it - then the issue gets forced and we all know how it stands
2014-11-13 03:19:18	jaycee_	yep
2014-11-13 03:19:27	jaycee_	S3TC/DXTn is not going away, its too widely used
2014-11-13 03:20:11	jaycee_	but like i said, why on earth are they worrying about it because it should be the hardware doing it- in that case, it is down to nvidia/amd to pay the royalties

2014-11-13 03:24:34	mirv_	just passing pre-encoded step through to the video card shouldn't be a patent issue

2014-11-13 03:27:14	jaycee_	if anyone really wanted to know, theyd have asked VIA by now
2014-11-13 03:27:47	jaycee_	a patent applies to the method being used, that means implementing it
2014-11-13 03:28:04	jaycee_	if you are passing data through to an ASIC that implements the decoding, then you are not implementing it, and patent doesnt apply
2014-11-13 03:28:47	jaycee_	and there is no need for the GL driver to support encoding

2014-11-13 03:33:06	jaycee_	getting VP to use git was one of the best changes we ever made
2014-11-13 03:33:40	Happy-Ferret	I've decided that, for my distro, I'll move all shell related settings/plugins into a folder called .shell/ Good or bad idea?
2014-11-13 03:34:40	von	it just feels easier to simply leave vim to do svn stuff than use vcscommand.vim
2014-11-13 03:35:37	von	jaycee_, we use svn for config management, git is nice, but an overkill. Not to mention that switching is problematic when svn functionality is enough
2014-11-13 03:36:07	jaycee_	yeah i havent imported any of our old projects into git yet
2014-11-13 03:36:21	jaycee_	its possible, just a rather manual process and a pain in the arse
2014-11-13 03:37:41	von	main problem is, it's hard to explain why we would even need it in our config management environment where there's only trunk / master needed 99% of the time
2014-11-13 03:38:34	von	(I'd still prefer to use git though)
2014-11-13 03:39:10	Happy-Ferret	It's less of a pain on the second try, trust me.
2014-11-13 03:39:57	von	Happy-Ferret, KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT does only array[0]=$array[1] sadly
2014-11-13 03:40:04	Happy-Ferret	You just have to make sure to have a list of contributors git can parse, otherwise the git log will look rather ugly.
2014-11-13 03:40:33	Happy-Ferret	von: Too bad.
2014-11-13 03:41:17	von	Happy-Ferret, zsh -c 'setopt KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT; array=(element1 element2); for i in {0..2}; do echo $array[$i]; done'
2014-11-13 03:41:41	Happy-Ferret	Well. Gonna have a look into the source. Shouldn't be too hard to compile a zsh with array (0), should it?
2014-11-13 03:42:46	 *	von doesn't know C
2014-11-13 03:43:39	von	or any programming language other than two shells I use every day lol
2014-11-13 03:44:26	von	also, Happy-Ferret, I think it's better to use either .config/shells or .local/lib/shells or .local/share/shells
2014-11-13 03:46:19	Happy-Ferret	Oh. Right. Forgot about .config
2014-11-13 03:46:27	Happy-Ferret	.config/
2014-11-13 03:48:45	Happy-Ferret	Another thing: I'm going to combine shell history for bash and zsh.
2014-11-13 03:49:13	von	does bash even support histfile appending?
2014-11-13 03:53:09	Happy-Ferret	Yea. Basic one.
2014-11-13 03:53:44	Happy-Ferret	If you open more than one /bin/bash session, only the last one is actually saved to the history file though.
2014-11-13 03:55:08	Happy-Ferret	In order to write to a histfile other than .bash_history, you can either make .bash_history a symbolic link or add "HISTFILE=.somehistory" to .bashrc

2014-11-13 05:17:25	jaycee_	you know that steam dont QA anything right, if you pay them, they put it on there
2014-11-13 05:17:44	jaycee_	and with greenlight, if enough people greenlight it, it goes on there
2014-11-13 05:17:45	liamdawe	flesk_: nope, no one has gone over it, or they have and it's fine, so i guess i will put it out soon

2014-11-13 05:18:29	Morgawr	this game looks even worse than some very ugly games I've seen on ludum dare
2014-11-13 05:18:32	jaycee_	thing is if Valve started QAing stuff on Steam, people would bitch about censorship

2014-11-13 05:18:58	Morgawr	valve used to QA stuff on steam though, I don't recall bitching about censorship then.. but nowadays the scene has changed to be "indie-friendly" with this bullshit
2014-11-13 05:19:02	jaycee_	personally i dont see the problem, if its shite, just dont buy it :)
2014-11-13 05:19:10	Morgawr	honestly, I just think "early access" is terrible anyway
2014-11-13 05:19:16	liamdawe	people can bitch all they like, quality control is not censorship, it's quality control on their own store
2014-11-13 05:19:46	jaycee_	liamdawe, but they do exactly that about Mac App Store
2014-11-13 05:19:47	Morgawr	jaycee_: the problem is not  that people are going to buy it, the problem is that this kind of crap is just a lot of noise on my steam page stream and it actually harms good games that get submerged by a load of literal crap
2014-11-13 05:20:00	Raven67854	jaycee_, Mac App Store != Steam Store
2014-11-13 05:20:04	Raven67854	Think you're confusing stores
2014-11-13 05:20:12	jaycee_	both of them sell games
2014-11-13 05:20:16	liamdawe	a store is a store, a store owner should be allowed to do whatever they like with it imo in regards to allowing/disallowing certain games on it
2014-11-13 05:20:29	DerRidda	On the iOS store they have a point because it's basically the only way to get software onto the system but on Mac they don't.

2014-11-13 06:38:56	mirv_	hmm, do I get the new space hulk, or wait for it to be on sale?
2014-11-13 06:39:28	Raven67854	mirv_, new spacehulk? why you no share?
2014-11-13 06:39:41	mirv_	Raven67854, I just found out a few minutes ago
2014-11-13 06:39:44	mirv_	it's on steam
2014-11-13 06:39:50	Raven67854	mirv_, wow that is a hell of an improvement
2014-11-13 06:40:07	tadzik	why, the previous one was on steam too
2014-11-13 06:40:08	 *	tadzik hides
2014-11-13 06:40:25	mirv_	tadzik, it supports Linux already
2014-11-13 06:40:30	mirv_	and mac
2014-11-13 06:40:34	Raven67854	It looks like it's a lot better
2014-11-13 06:40:36	Raven67854	It's a unity game
2014-11-13 06:40:39	mirv_	yep
2014-11-13 06:40:44	Raven67854	So no duh :p
2014-11-13 06:40:51	mirv_	looks better, and apparently plays a little different to before
2014-11-13 06:41:07	tadzik	the pacing in the previous one was what mostly bored me in the original
2014-11-13 06:41:09	mirv_	I'm a space hulk nutter...but 25 Euro
2014-11-13 06:41:10	mirv_	hrmmm
2014-11-13 06:41:30	mirv_	tadzik, I assume you mean "full control original"
2014-11-13 06:41:46	tadzik	well, the Linux Space Hulk Game From Steam
2014-11-13 06:42:01	mirv_	the EA version was awesome
2014-11-13 06:42:10	mirv_	but the dos music sucked
2014-11-13 06:42:15	mirv_	amiga music was so much better
2014-11-13 06:42:29	Raven67854	mirv_, $23 here
2014-11-13 06:42:31	tadzik	it's one of these games that I was gifted, really tried to enjoy, but did not
2014-11-13 06:42:34	Raven67854	So I assume 23 euro their
2014-11-13 06:42:38	Raven67854	You suck at counting mirv_
2014-11-13 06:42:54	mirv_	Raven67854, no, 25.19Euro here

2014-11-13 06:49:10	Raven67854	But they at least try to match

2014-11-13 06:49:30	mirv_	hmm....must check credit account first
2014-11-13 06:49:43	tadzik	btw, the November GOL Survey says "wine port (like Witcher 2)" or something like that
2014-11-13 06:49:48	tadzik	that's... not exactly correct
2014-11-13 06:50:02	Raven67854	tadzik, It's not correct at all
2014-11-13 06:50:19	tadzik	"Games using Wine wrappers (such as The Witcher 2) do not count as Wine games"
2014-11-13 06:50:27	Raven67854	LOL

2014-11-13 07:01:42	jaycee_	i wish people would understand the difference bteween eON and WINE
2014-11-13 07:02:03	jaycee_	bu the people who usually argue on it are the ones who are in the "native or nothing" camp anyway

2014-11-13 07:02:52	tadzik	although I only played the original
2014-11-13 07:02:57	Raven67854	jaycee_, more native ports than wrapped ports to be fair
2014-11-13 07:03:31	Raven67854	tadzik, Oh it's because I liked icewind dale. I was just wondering if the enhanced edition was worth the $20 I'm about to spend
2014-11-13 07:03:35	jaycee_	thats good, and i agree its the best way, but its not the solution we offer. and if we didnt offer it, youd either get more wineskin jobs, or no port at all
2014-11-13 07:03:47	tadzik	Raven67854: ah, I see
2014-11-13 07:03:57	jaycee_	linux is simply too small a market share right now for every developer to justify the expense of a native port
2014-11-13 07:03:59	Raven67854	jaycee_, my point was that you've given us 2 games. And we've gotten more native ports than you've given us. So basically I disagree. We'd be just fine without
2014-11-13 07:04:09	tadzik	wellllll
2014-11-13 07:04:15	tadzik	I'm happier with Witcher 2 than without

2014-11-13 07:09:44	Raven67854	jaycee_, Stronghold 3 has nothing to do with eON
2014-11-13 07:09:44	tadzik	it's pretty boring, but on the plus side it runs quite well

2014-11-13 07:09:56	jaycee_	Raven67854, yeah
2014-11-13 07:09:57	Raven67854	Was awful on release
2014-11-13 07:10:04	Raven67854	Still awful today
2014-11-13 07:10:06	@Samsai	witcher 2 had its issues and sh3 was just a bad game
2014-11-13 07:10:22	Raven67854	I'd still rather not have eON
2014-11-13 07:10:26	jaycee_	Raven67854, what can i say, we were paid to port it.. cant really refuse because "we think your game's shit" :)
2014-11-13 07:10:26	Raven67854	And no jaycee_ I don't care what you say
2014-11-13 07:10:37	tadzik	I'm sure the feeling is mutual :P
2014-11-13 07:10:38	Raven67854	jaycee_, I totally get that. I'm just saying that nobody should buy that thing
2014-11-13 07:10:49	Raven67854	Windows/Mac/Linux
2014-11-13 07:10:52	jaycee_	ok well, it doesnt harm us if noone does :)
2014-11-13 07:10:58	Raven67854	The amount of issues that game has
2014-11-13 07:11:16	jaycee_	theres a few games in our back catalogue i'd love to have a go at
2014-11-13 07:11:33	jaycee_	Riddick would be one, but it isnt up to us
2014-11-13 07:11:33	Raven67854	tadzik, Just tired of hearing that without eON we wouldn't get game. because it's a load of bullshit

2014-11-13 07:11:52	jaycee_	Raven67854, youd get wine wrapper, or nothing, is my point
2014-11-13 07:12:00	Raven67854	jaycee_, or I'd get a god damn native :P
2014-11-13 07:12:06	@Samsai	or we might eventually get an open engine for that game
2014-11-13 07:12:07	jaycee_	no, you wouldnt
2014-11-13 07:12:10	Raven67854	Which more often than not is what I get
2014-11-13 07:12:23	Raven67854	I have very few wrapped games on Linux
2014-11-13 07:12:28	Raven67854	and most that are wrapped are increadibly old
2014-11-13 07:12:41	jaycee_	if we advised cost of a fully native port to most people that approach us, they would say "no" and thats it

2014-11-13 07:13:01	Raven67854	It's fantastic
2014-11-13 07:13:13	jaycee_	hardly a sustainable market, though
2014-11-13 07:13:36	jaycee_	quite frankly the people who have approached us about Linux so far, have actually approached us about "SteamOS"
2014-11-13 07:14:04	Raven67854	we also have Ethan and Ryan
2014-11-13 07:14:07	jaycee_	my thinking is that they are seeing SteamOS/Steam Machines as more of an "open console platform"
2014-11-13 07:14:22	Raven67854	Or marketing just like the buzzword hype
2014-11-13 07:14:36	Raven67854	Sounds better than Linux
2014-11-13 07:15:03	tadzik	yeah
2014-11-13 07:15:09	tadzik	which is okay
2014-11-13 07:15:18	tadzik	Linux is a bad brand and nobody cares about it

2014-11-13 07:15:58	tadzik	wow
2014-11-13 07:16:13	Raven67854	Yeah I didn't know alienware was selling them in walmart stores
2014-11-13 07:16:52	von	I wants BG2EE :<
2014-11-13 07:17:02	Raven67854	von, does the coop work?

2014-11-13 07:17:19	von	Raven67854, those games I only play singleplayer
2014-11-13 07:17:35	Raven67854	Well I just wonder if the enhanced versions work in coop :p
2014-11-13 07:17:38	von	and none of my friends are interested in them anyway
2014-11-13 07:17:43	Raven67854	Oh but sir
2014-11-13 07:17:45	Raven67854	I am interested
2014-11-13 07:17:45	von	they have multiplayer
2014-11-13 07:17:48	tadzik	I'm curious about co-oping it
2014-11-13 07:17:50	Raven67854	baldurs gate 2 in MP
2014-11-13 07:17:54	tadzik	but I heard it sucks
2014-11-13 07:17:56	Raven67854	So awesome
2014-11-13 07:17:58	von	and I think it works
2014-11-13 07:18:12	Raven67854	tadzik, Baldurs Gate 2 in coop was a bitch to get working sometimes
2014-11-13 07:18:16	tadzik	as in, one person does the dialouges and the others just stand there
2014-11-13 07:18:28	von	yeah, IWDEE works better in that regard
2014-11-13 07:18:35	von	not so much dialogue
2014-11-13 07:18:38	tadzik	because it has little to no dialogue :P
2014-11-13 07:19:00	von	I was actually a bit tired of constant fighting by the end of the expansion
2014-11-13 07:19:02	Raven67854	tadzik, we should also play some C&C or RA
2014-11-13 07:19:07	Raven67854	Because it's awesome that's why
2014-11-13 07:19:08	tadzik	I never played either
2014-11-13 07:19:15	Raven67854	Or Dune 2!
2014-11-13 07:19:15	tadzik	but I played PA, and you know how that went?
2014-11-13 07:19:19	Raven67854	they added works I think
2014-11-13 07:19:26	Raven67854	tadzik, We can play without their ugly servers now
2014-11-13 07:19:41	tadzik	eliminating 50% of the things that can crash and ruin the fun, good :P
2014-11-13 07:19:53	Raven67854	Exactly
2014-11-13 07:20:20	Raven67854	I wish it was easy to play TA
2014-11-13 07:21:23	psymin	PA?
2014-11-13 07:21:33	Raven67854	psymin, Plannetary Anihilation
2014-11-13 07:22:00	psymin	ooh I thought it was fun

2014-11-13 07:25:14	liamdawe	lots of micro managing
2014-11-13 07:26:18	von	you mean more than infinity engine?
2014-11-13 07:28:21	@Samsai	is it though?
2014-11-13 07:28:37	@Samsai	i think you macro it quite nicely
2014-11-13 07:30:39	von	actually now that I think about it, the amount of micromanagement needed in infinity engine games is easily compensated by interactive pause available at any moment
2014-11-13 07:30:48	von	also, Raven67854 multiclasses ftw!
2014-11-13 07:32:21	tadzik	I play Swashbuckler-Bard in D&D

2014-11-13 07:41:55	tadzik	ya
2014-11-13 07:41:56	von	dualclass is kinda too, but dem fighter/mages and fighter/thieves
2014-11-13 07:42:33	von	I've played through IWDEE with only one non-multiclass character being thief/mage dualclass
2014-11-13 07:42:38	tadzik	them shitty armors though
2014-11-13 07:42:51	von	ah, I've also had Inquisitor
2014-11-13 07:43:16	von	Dispell is surprisingly relevant in IWDEE
2014-11-13 07:43:29	von	much more so than in both BGEE and BG2EE
2014-11-13 07:43:46	von	(although I've played them on lower difficulty setting)
2014-11-13 07:43:49	tadzik	BG hardly had problematic support mages iirc
2014-11-13 07:44:56	von	also judging by the reply I got on bg forums, it is possible that separate setting for hp rolls will be added to both BGEE games

2014-11-13 07:47:04	von	speaking of which, I think Supergiant Games' releases have the best way of setting difficulty level ever made in a videogame

2014-11-13 12:54:08	Happy-Ferret_	I was wondering whether there was a way to emulate Apple Safari behaviour, as far as Flash content was concerned.

2014-11-13 12:54:22	romo_sapien	just a second
2014-11-13 12:55:29	Happy-Ferret_	In Safari, Flash content is only played when you actually access the tab. So one can easily open several Youtube videos in the background without them chaotically playing themselves.
2014-11-13 12:56:24	romo_sapien	Oh,  if that's the result that you want
2014-11-13 12:56:31	romo_sapien	Then there's a better way to get it
2014-11-13 12:56:33	disharmonic	There is and it doesn't require about:config. You can set flash to activate manually

2014-11-13 13:47:49	von	killer features - minimalistic config that's easy to migrate and sync and the ability to disable bold and italics while using bold bitmap font
2014-11-13 13:48:46	Happy-Ferret_	The install time of Sakura was quite impressive, though. Only took 5 seconds to download and install via apt-get
2014-11-13 13:49:26	von	yeah, it's very minimalistic
2014-11-13 13:50:04	von	sadly, it does not allow disabling bold font
2014-11-13 13:50:38	Happy-Ferret_	I might give this one a try. Should integrate very well with my distro's philosophy and its XUL framework.

If I leave my xbox 360 controller idle for 3 seconds without input, the cursor will repeatedly move to the left, but only in Big Picture. Interestingly, if I manage to get over to the controller options, I'll see that my wireless mouse (Microsoft 3500) is registering as a controller when the input goes weird. Pressing the DPad resets input, but if I leave it for a

2014-11-14 03:36:48	Dezponia	Still I really really dislike the new music. To me it sound generic and boring and dont fit the game as well

2014-11-14 04:12:33	Happy-Ferret	When it comes to Windows, I'm proud to proclaim that I have absolutely no clue. ^^
2014-11-14 04:13:51	NuSuey	*high five*
2014-11-14 04:16:20	jaycee_	Happy-Ferret, like most linux users, so it's ok ;)
2014-11-14 04:16:33	jaycee_	i use curl on windows quite often
2014-11-14 04:17:09	jaycee_	and flashfxp is a good windows ftp client, though filezilla will do in a pinch (i use that on the mac)
2014-11-14 04:17:20	mirv_	Happy-Ferret, your colleague has no ftp access on the windows machine?
2014-11-14 04:17:29	mirv_	port is blocked, I assume?
2014-11-14 04:18:13	mirv_	I think some cygwin mirrors use http instead of ftp
2014-11-14 04:18:14	jaycee_	i do wish Atlassian would make Sourcetree happen on linux though, as it's awesome
2014-11-14 04:18:33	jaycee_	cygwin *shudder*
2014-11-14 04:21:03	Happy-Ferret	Nah. He has ftp access on his machine. I just didn't know how to work ftp in Windows.
2014-11-14 04:21:20	mirv_	Happy-Ferret, no need, the cygwin installer should take care of that
2014-11-14 04:22:06	jaycee_	i was just thinking that
2014-11-14 04:22:28	jaycee_	its been a while since i installed it but the setup tool downloads everything itself and will even keep the packages
2014-11-14 04:22:35	mirv_	yep
2014-11-14 04:23:00	mirv_	I'd rather avoid cygwin myself, but that's mostly because if I want a *nix environment, I just use Linux
2014-11-14 04:23:12	jaycee_	yeah, because cygwin is generally just awful
2014-11-14 04:23:18	jaycee_	well.. redhat.. say no more
2014-11-14 04:23:19	mirv_	has its place
2014-11-14 04:24:01	mirv_	actually my old work used it to great effect because they were forced to used windows machines...
2014-11-14 04:24:23	mirv_	but the developers were more comfortable with *nix setups for scripting & whatnot
2014-11-14 04:24:36	jaycee_	this is generally my problem with it to be honest
2014-11-14 04:24:51	mirv_	*to use
2014-11-14 04:25:02	jaycee_	using non native tools is always going to be awkward and clunky
2014-11-14 04:25:04	Happy-Ferret	The cygwin installer was unable to find any mirror, for some reason.
2014-11-14 04:25:10	mirv_	jaycee_, yes, I agree
2014-11-14 04:25:15	mirv_	but time constraints & all
2014-11-14 04:25:20	Happy-Ferret	Proxy settings were correct though.
2014-11-14 04:25:35	jaycee_	mirv_, biggest problem is that gcc with it is so slow, because fork() is slow
2014-11-14 04:25:55	Happy-Ferret	The reason he wants Cygwin is so he can try the tanasinn terminal emulator
2014-11-14 04:25:56	mirv_	Happy-Ferret, you can probably just pick one from online and feed it to the installer
2014-11-14 04:26:01	mirv_	....
2014-11-14 04:26:04	mirv_	....
2014-11-14 04:26:07	jaycee_	thing is, for just fork/execve you dont need to emulate fork at all
2014-11-14 04:26:10	mirv_	ok, that sounds bad

2014-11-14 04:26:37	mirv_	jaycee_, well, I prefer not to have a cygwin layer at all when compiling
2014-11-14 04:26:44	mirv_	native tools there just win
2014-11-14 04:27:06	jaycee_	mingw is probably better if you must use gcc
2014-11-14 04:27:41	jaycee_	Happy-Ferret, if he's moaning about cmd.exe he is better off looking at things like ConEmu
2014-11-14 04:28:29	jaycee_	or the unhelpfully named Console
2014-11-14 04:29:21	jaycee_	and if you want bash, then yeah, mingw - its much more efficient than cygwin

2014-11-14 04:50:14	Happy-Ferret	tanasinn terminal emulator does just that but requires cygwin under Windows.

2014-11-14 08:30:39	Happy-Ferret	Seriously. Either legalize running over human beings (in which case I'm personally looking forward to some funny looking, hairless roadkill) or punish running over animals.
2014-11-14 08:32:24	liamdawe	Happy-Ferret: i guess the rules of the road are different here, if you see an animal you keep going or risk a car crash with ur hard braking
2014-11-14 08:33:06	Happy-Ferret	Unlikely to happen in a place with only 10 houses, Liam.
2014-11-14 08:34:15	liamdawe	well who knows what happened Happy-Ferret, you can't judge if you weren't there
2014-11-14 08:35:20	Happy-Ferret	Somehow, I've never hit a tramp. Despite them popping up on the highway every now and then (some even walking right into my direction) in the middle of the night, yet people manage to run over all sorts of animals in broad daylight in a 15mp/h zone.
2014-11-14 08:36:14	liamdawe	humans know to move out of the way, animals will generally keep going and just speed up going straight = death
2014-11-14 08:36:32	Happy-Ferret	I can judge, Liam. 1. It's a 15mp/h zone. 2. A decent human being would, at the very least, remove the corpse instead of leaving it in the middle of the road.
2014-11-14 08:37:11	liamdawe	well judge away, i won't because I don't know what happened
2014-11-14 08:37:51	liamdawe	Samsai: do you have a key for the last federation?
2014-11-14 08:37:55	liamdawe	can't remember
2014-11-14 08:38:15	Happy-Ferret	Not sure we're living on the same planet, Liam. "My humans" don't exactly avoid traffic. They somehow manage to be just stupid enough to walk in the middle of a highway at 3 AM in the morning.
2014-11-14 08:39:01	Happy-Ferret	But hey. If I ever hit one, I'll leave the corpse in the middle of the road too. See what others are thinking.
2014-11-14 08:39:54	jaycee_	in the uk its actually an offence to swerve to avoid an animal... however many do. its also entirely possible, if it was only a kitten, that the driver simply didnt notice
2014-11-14 08:40:07	jaycee_	and if it was that small a kitten, it shouldnt have been outside in the first place
2014-11-14 08:40:34	jaycee_	we didnt let any of our cats out of the garden until they were well experienced with the outdoors
2014-11-14 08:40:51	liamdawe	pretty much all of what jaycee_ said
2014-11-14 08:41:14	liamdawe	an animal is an animal, roads are dangerous, kittens should be inside, protected

2014-11-15 10:24:38	Happy-Ferret	Hehe. Would be cool if you could ask one of them for me.
2014-11-15 10:25:55	Happy-Ferret	This whole code is a maddening mess. Not sure why everyone seems to think their stupid prototyping systems are so hip and cool. It makes everything just plain hard to read.
2014-11-15 10:26:39	Sik	Happy-Ferret: 147 to 152 can be converted to CSS easily (although gradiation needs more info)
2014-11-15 10:26:47	Sik	No idea what 145 and 146 are meant to be though
2014-11-15 10:27:27	Happy-Ferret	Sik, care to elaborate about 147-152? How would I go about it? Do I need a function feeding the css file into it?
2014-11-15 10:28:30	Sik	Er not really, each DOM element has a style property with every possible CSS property in it
2014-11-15 10:28:43	Sik	E.g. background-color is (object).style.backgroundColor
2014-11-15 10:28:56	Sik	(dashes are replaced with camel case)
2014-11-15 10:29:29	Sik	"foreground_color" is CSS's "color" (I assume that's the text color, right?)
2014-11-15 10:29:54	Sik	"background_opacity" is only meant to affect the background, right? If so, it's part of background-color (use a rgba() value, not a #xxxxxx triplet)
2014-11-15 10:30:19	Sik	Just saying because CSS's opacity property affects everything in it
2014-11-15 10:31:01	Happy-Ferret	I get that. But how would I go about importing the CSS file itself? I'd like to completely move those parts into a seperate css file.
2014-11-15 10:31:09	Sik	Gradients in CSS are implemented as background images (for backwards compatibility with browsers that don't support them, so they show up the color instead), although remember you can have multiple background images on the same element
2014-11-15 10:31:15	Sik	Oh um
2014-11-15 10:31:30	Happy-Ferret	As for gradients, I wouldn't mind getting rid of the gradient background.
2014-11-15 10:31:35	Sik	Gimme a sec but I think that what you'd do is create either a <link> or a <style> element
2014-11-15 10:31:51	Sik	<link> makes it import the CSS file, <style> is for embedding it instead
2014-11-15 10:32:18	Sik	If you want to let the browser import the CSS file on its own (good idea), the syntax is <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> (replace style.css with filename)

2014-11-15 10:33:06	Sik	You could go the proper DOM way of adding the element but I have the feeling document.write() in the end will be easier :P (and it's not deprecated despite being that old, it's just too well supported to drop)
2014-11-15 10:34:00	Sik	But yes after including the CSS file all you should need to do is set classes or IDs as required (if you even need that)
2014-11-15 10:35:18	Happy-Ferret	Oh. Ok. Didn't know I could use the link syntax inside js. Gonna try that. Thanks

2014-11-15 12:24:47	Sik	Heh, over here (Argentina) it was mandatory too (it was originally imposed to prevent foreigners from bringing in their own patriotism)
2014-11-15 12:25:07	Sik	It was removed when somebody died due to mistreating from his superior :/

2014-11-15 14:17:18	stqn	my I plug my wireless xbox360 pad into my pc, linux sees it as an xbox360 controller… but it doesn’t work in games.
2014-11-15 14:17:43	jc__	because its not a standard hid device
2014-11-15 14:17:52	jc__	you need either xboxdrv or xpad to make it do something
2014-11-15 14:18:16	jc__	and then SDL2 has to have the right mapping if thats being used. if not, good luck
2014-11-15 14:19:35	von	or use antimicro
2014-11-15 14:20:44	stqn	ok so… installing xboxdrv should make it work?
2014-11-15 14:20:52	von	installing and running
2014-11-15 14:21:09	jc__	its more to do with controller input on linux being a mess
2014-11-15 14:21:12	von	it's a userspace program for joydev, not a kernel driver like xpad
2014-11-15 14:21:40	gkeen_	i thought it was just plug n play with 360 controller and linux?
2014-11-15 14:21:41	stqn	well Arch has xpad but not xboxdrv, so I’ll try xpad
2014-11-15 14:21:55	von	if it's loaded, then your pad should work
2014-11-15 14:22:22	jc__	gkeen_, not with linux.. more with ubuntu.. even then its hit and miss
2014-11-15 14:23:12	stqn	ah well the pad wants to associate with the xbox…
2014-11-15 14:24:01	gkeen_	aha, and what about the xbone controller?

2014-11-16 08:21:50	jaycee	if gabe had wanted to take it as far as he could, then yes he couldve prosecuted the guy
2014-11-16 08:22:28	jaycee	also when you put your stuff on Steam you sign an agreement with Valve, im pretty sure not writing libellous or slanderous things about them and their staff is one of the conditions
2014-11-16 08:22:36	jaycee	its a pretty standard condition of any agreement like that
2014-11-16 08:23:20	jaycee	at the end of the day, what mike did was childish and irresponsible, and as he was representing his company then Valve have done nothing heavy handed whatsoever
2014-11-16 08:23:27	jaycee	he's lucky that all they did was remove their game
2014-11-16 08:23:52	jaycee	they could easily have sued them or turned it into a criminal matte
2014-11-16 08:24:15	von	I stand by my words
2014-11-16 08:24:20	von	Valve overreacted
2014-11-16 08:24:33	jaycee	no they didnt, not legally or professionally
2014-11-16 08:24:43	von	pursuing the guy in court would have been even a bigger overreaction
2014-11-16 08:24:48	von	they did
2014-11-16 08:24:59	jaycee	no, this is business and the way that guy behaved was unacceptable
2014-11-16 08:25:00	von	it's opinion vs opinion, jaycee
2014-11-16 08:25:09	von	you see that as a reason to condemn him
2014-11-16 08:25:16	von	I see that as an overreaction
2014-11-16 08:25:20	von	*fair reason
2014-11-16 08:25:51	jaycee	we're not talking about a couple of kids here, they are grown men, they are in business. the other guy shouldve reeled mike in
2014-11-16 08:25:56	von	I'm also pretty sure that Valve screwed up their clients
2014-11-16 08:26:09	jaycee	if you make public statements on twitter representing your company, then your company takes the rap
2014-11-16 08:26:17	von	if I owned a copy on steam I'd pretty much have gotten stuck with unmaintained version
2014-11-16 08:26:30	jaycee	right, well that isnt valves fault
2014-11-16 08:26:40	jaycee	code avarice breached their agreement with valve, eod
2014-11-16 08:26:45	von	so yeah, overreaction + screwing up people who bought the game on their store
2014-11-16 08:26:48	von	nope
2014-11-16 08:27:04	von	unless valve has provided refunds
2014-11-16 08:27:08	von	I disagree
2014-11-16 08:27:31	jaycee	why should valve provide refunds
2014-11-16 08:27:45	jaycee	theyve already paid code avarice for those purchases
2014-11-16 08:27:57	von	valve as a bigger entity has more responsibility in this situation
2014-11-16 08:28:06	jaycee	CA did something that resulted in their game getting pulled from the store, so it is down to CA to deal with refunds and compensation
2014-11-16 08:28:13	jaycee	thats got nothing to do with it, legally
2014-11-16 08:28:20	jaycee	valve is a business, CA are a business
2014-11-16 08:28:21	von	sadly valve have no idea what pr is and they are the biggest in the market so they can do whatever they want
2014-11-16 08:28:24	Raven67854	You could probably get a refund for it
2014-11-16 08:28:27	von	it's another statement of this
2014-11-16 08:28:35	Raven67854	and valve would dump that cost onto CA
2014-11-16 08:28:53	jaycee	Raven67854, the knock on effect would be that Valve would then recover the money from CA, but they would likely now have to take CA to court in order to d so
2014-11-16 08:28:53	Raven67854	If you owned it that is
2014-11-16 08:29:11	Raven67854	jaycee, yeah but they'd easily win.. I mean death threats pretty much invalidate any argument really
2014-11-16 08:29:15	jaycee	the legal costs of Valve doing that would probably bankrupt CA
2014-11-16 08:29:20	jaycee	Raven67854, yes
2014-11-16 08:29:41	jaycee	at the end of the day CA still has a saleable product they can sell elsewhere
2014-11-16 08:29:45	Raven67854	von, I don't think valve over-reacted. CA did over something idiotic. he didn't even first contact valve about getting it fixed
2014-11-16 08:29:46	von	invalidates any argument and condemns people
2014-11-16 08:30:04	Raven67854	He imploded on twitter like a moron
2014-11-16 08:30:08	jaycee	CA breached their agreement with Valve, Valve terminated the agreement and removed the game. thats how it is legally
2014-11-16 08:30:11	von	Raven67854, I'm not saying he wasn't acting liek a moron
2014-11-16 08:30:22	von	I'm saying it's an overreaction on Valve's part
2014-11-16 08:30:23	Raven67854	von, why would valve keep their game on the store. They have no reason to
2014-11-16 08:30:39	jaycee	this smells of "i just hate valve" tbh
2014-11-16 08:30:39	von	“oh god, death threats on teh internet!”
2014-11-16 08:30:59	von	yeah, right
2014-11-16 08:30:59	Raven67854	von, when it comes to business and professionalism you don't make death threats
2014-11-16 08:31:00	jaycee	we deal with valve all the time, they are reasonable people
2014-11-16 08:31:07	Raven67854	Ever
2014-11-16 08:31:09	jaycee	what Raven67854 just said
2014-11-16 08:31:10	von	whatever
2014-11-16 08:31:12	Raven67854	No excuse and it's not a joke
2014-11-16 08:31:57	jaycee	seriously, i might curse apple all the time, but if I went on VP's twitter feed and posted "Apple are cunts", i expect Apple would turn around, cancel our ADC access, and sue us
2014-11-16 08:31:58	Raven67854	Hell it was on the front page. Who cares if it said early access. he was still selling his game like crazy. he should of just contacted valve and had them fix it.
2014-11-16 08:32:28	von	not saying that he wasn't wrong in doing so just in case
2014-11-16 08:33:03	von	he was overreacting too, in an ugly childish way
2014-11-16 08:33:09	Raven67854	von, I know I just don't understand how oyu think valve over-reacted. I mean so because they're the biggest seller when an employee of valve receives death threats credible or not. They should leave said company's game on the store?

2014-11-16 08:33:47	von	they should have warned him and talked to him
2014-11-16 08:33:55	Raven67854	You mean like how he talked to them? :P
2014-11-16 08:34:04	von	I mean like grown up people
2014-11-16 08:34:12	jaycee	von, like i said, CA will have signed an agreement
2014-11-16 08:34:16	jaycee	they breached the agreement
2014-11-16 08:34:17	jaycee	end of

2014-11-16 08:34:33	Raven67854	Right well grown ups don't run around sending death threats to people because the image says Early access instead of now out of early access
2014-11-16 08:34:37	von	Raven67854, the consequences are not adequate in my opinion
2014-11-16 08:34:44	von	that's the definition of “overreacting”
2014-11-16 08:34:57	Raven67854	von, Well get a game on the store and send a death threat to said store
2014-11-16 08:35:00	Raven67854	Watch what happens
2014-11-16 08:35:03	Raven67854	Wouldn't be unique to valve

2014-11-16 08:36:47	jaycee	yeah
2014-11-16 08:36:56	Raven67854	His business partner should leave and setup his own

2014-11-16 08:37:02	Raven67854	Nobody would hold it against him

2014-11-16 08:37:38	jaycee	currently it seems like theyre doing the whole "waa waa big bad bullies Valve" act
2014-11-16 08:37:54	Raven67854	jaycee, Yeah it's valves fault! Not his fault for being an idiot
2014-11-16 08:38:27	jaycee	indeed
2014-11-16 08:38:58	jaycee	using personal twitter accounts for company announcements was dumb as well
2014-11-16 08:39:14	jaycee	"He [Mike] posted the announcement to the site before even talking to Travis about his intentions"
2014-11-16 08:39:26	jaycee	ugh, so there is just no business acumen with either of them

2014-11-16 08:46:50	FutureSuture	I wish I had what he had and the skill to do so and he threw it all away like the turd that he is. What a fool.
2014-11-16 08:46:58	von	FutureSuture, when I play a videogame, there's nothing at stake. The company is not only this guy and there are people who have bought the game on the steam store

2014-11-16 08:47:05	jaycee	so yes, UK law is making sending people threats on twitter, facebook etc a criminal offence, as it already is in person, by mail, over the phone etc
2014-11-16 08:47:19	jaycee	von, those customers should blame CA, not valve
2014-11-16 08:47:27	von	it's not about blaming
2014-11-16 08:47:31	von	it's about providing service
2014-11-16 08:47:42	von	and store's responsibility
2014-11-16 08:47:49	von	but as I've said
2014-11-16 08:47:51	von	whatever
2014-11-16 08:47:59	FutureSuture	To be honest, von, I am with jaycee and Raven67854 here. GOG would have (hopefully) done the same.
2014-11-16 08:48:06	Raven67854	They would have
2014-11-16 08:48:13	jaycee	right so, if you buy a game on disc from Best Buy, and the game turns out to be buggy, you blame Best Buy ?
2014-11-16 08:48:17	von	I know my opinion is the least popular
2014-11-16 08:48:45	Raven67854	It's more about common sense =/
2014-11-16 08:48:52	von	subjective.
2014-11-16 08:48:58	Raven67854	You send a death threat. it has consequences...
2014-11-16 08:48:59	jaycee	its common sense and business practice
2014-11-16 08:49:05	Raven67854	And all CA got out of it was the game pulled from the store
2014-11-16 08:49:08	FutureSuture	The other guy did nothing wrong, von, agreed, he just had a turd for a partner and was extremely unlucky like that. I am sure he'll do well for himself later, though.
2014-11-16 08:49:11	Raven67854	It could of been much much worse
2014-11-16 08:49:28	jaycee	FutureSuture, the other guy did do something wrong - he went into business with a moron who has no self control
2014-11-16 08:50:03	jaycee	Mike spoke for CA as a company with his rage tweet, Travis allowed that to happen
2014-11-16 08:50:18	FutureSuture	jaycee, maybe he did not expect his foolishness to reach such levels. :P
2014-11-16 08:50:35	Raven67854	Ever actually followed mike before on twitter FutureSuture ?
2014-11-16 08:50:39	jaycee	they've only just opened a CA twitter feed for official company announcements - that was a big mistake right there
2014-11-16 08:50:53	FutureSuture	Raven67854, I do not even use Twitter, so nope.
2014-11-16 08:50:54	jaycee	FutureSuture, his negligence is no excuse as far as law goes though
2014-11-16 08:51:17	FutureSuture	I just find it funny that Garry gets a free pass all the time because "He's Garry. That's how he is."
2014-11-16 08:51:27	Raven67854	Garry doesn't send death threats
2014-11-16 08:52:04	FutureSuture	Garry throws tantrums and drops "words of wisdom" on the Linux community. Classy stuff.
2014-11-16 08:52:14	@Samsai	still not death threats though
2014-11-16 08:52:15	Raven67854	he doesn't send death threats
2014-11-16 08:52:34	Raven67854	Mike could of easily of pissed and moaned all he wanted and nobody would of done/said a thing. Sure not classy but whatever
2014-11-16 08:52:38	FutureSuture	He's got more control than Mike, I'll give him that.
2014-11-16 08:52:39	Raven67854	he crossed the line with the death threat
2014-11-16 08:52:50	FutureSuture	Still, what a manchild.
2014-11-16 08:53:00	Raven67854	FutureSuture, Yeah nobody cares about Garry honestly
2014-11-16 08:53:27	FutureSuture	Love how Samsai just popped up out of nowhere. :P
2014-11-16 08:53:50	@Samsai	i was fighting the obscura, but now i have returned victorious
2014-11-16 08:53:59	FutureSuture	Anyway, I shall bid you all adieu for now. Have a lovely afternoon/evening. Might even be morning for Raven67854, so let that be jolly too.
2014-11-16 08:54:02	@Samsai	and i figured i might as well join in on the conversation
2014-11-16 08:54:13	Raven67854	it's noon

2014-11-16 17:17:01	von	I don't really get how to be careful about that. Was the account stolen with the victim not doing anything at all?
2014-11-16 17:17:09	von	or was she scammed?
2014-11-16 17:18:19	jaycee	scammed most likely
2014-11-16 17:18:30	Griffinstein	she was scammed
2014-11-16 17:18:54	Griffinstein	she basically clicked a link and all was gone
2014-11-16 17:19:06	von	oh
2014-11-16 17:19:23	Griffinstein	just trying to spread awareness about it you know dont want to see this happening to anyone else
2014-11-16 17:19:27	DerRidda	That's what Windows gets you.
2014-11-16 17:20:10	von	is it now? The transactions are made via HTTP requests most likely. If that scammer is capable of constructing such requests, no one is safe
2014-11-16 17:20:43	DerRidda	The vulnerability that is used for these attacks has been fixed some time ago.
2014-11-16 17:20:44	Griffinstein	i was telling my friend steam needs some ssl encryption
2014-11-16 17:20:51	von	seems unlikely though
2014-11-16 17:21:16	von	I got a few phishing links on steam lately
2014-11-16 17:21:37	Raven67854	yeah I'
2014-11-16 17:21:40	DerRidda	No, there was an attack where browsers would automatically download an infected screensaver file that also got automatically executed.
2014-11-16 17:21:42	Griffinstein	i just had to drop my windows partition because of viruses and malware got it is bad this year for windows
2014-11-16 17:21:57	Raven67854	Yeah I've been getting a few. Nice little .png link. which leads to some executable with a .src extension
2014-11-16 17:22:06	von	oh, that
2014-11-16 17:22:29	DerRidda	Literally not possible like that on Linux.
2014-11-16 17:22:46	Raven67854	Not possible on Windows either unless you run the damn thing
2014-11-16 17:22:49	von	the main security concern of any operating system is its user
2014-11-16 17:23:01	Griffinstein	true
2014-11-16 17:23:17	DerRidda	I think they also used something for automatic execution but I'm not sure.
2014-11-16 17:23:51	Griffinstein	i do get all my stuff from ppa's and such so with the gnome keyring linux doesnt really have to worry
2014-11-16 17:24:01	DerRidda	I'm still putting at least one obvious scammer bot on my ban list per day. It's usually two or three.
2014-11-16 17:24:05	jaycee	oh please. most browsers on windows, firefox, chrome hell even IE now, wont let you execute anything executable without warning you
2014-11-16 17:24:11	jaycee	and a .scr is just an executable file
2014-11-16 17:24:30	Griffinstein	but with windows you download alot of stuff from the internet browser and i just like going through repos lol
2014-11-16 17:24:44	jaycee	in fact i think chrome on windows defaults to not letting you download anything executable
2014-11-16 17:24:45	Raven67854	You could just not download the file or if you do not run the damn thing :P
2014-11-16 17:24:52	Raven67854	jaycee, no it doesn't
2014-11-16 17:25:00	Raven67854	You can download executables just fine
2014-11-16 17:25:06	jaycee	Raven67854, one of the browsers does, cant remember which
2014-11-16 17:26:18	jaycee	i think it's chromes "phishing and malware protection", by default it warns you about every executable it downlosads
2014-11-16 17:26:25	DerRidda	I think this stuff might directly execute if you are using IE.
2014-11-16 17:26:32	jaycee	no it doesnt
2014-11-16 17:26:48	jaycee	thats just what people who get infected say
2014-11-16 17:26:49	Griffinstein	most of them ask you if you want to run the app
2014-11-16 17:26:52	jaycee	"i dont know it just started doing it"
2014-11-16 17:26:53	Raven67854	the link is a png.. so I don't think people pay attention
2014-11-16 17:27:04	Raven67854	after it downloads they just "run" it
2014-11-16 17:27:08	DerRidda	But if you are using IE - and I don't care how much anyone says it has improved - you ahd that coming.
2014-11-16 17:27:25	jaycee	maybe if youre still using IE6
2014-11-16 17:27:41	jaycee	every time ive downloaded something with IE thats executable, it warns me about it

2014-11-16 17:28:09	Griffinstein	we can all agree on something we are linux nerds
2014-11-16 17:28:33	jaycee	patched
2014-11-16 17:28:37	DerRidda	So yeah, IE is at it again.
2014-11-16 17:28:43	von	all windows browsers warn you about executable files downloads
2014-11-16 17:29:02	von	hell, linux browsers warn you about shell scripts and common package formats
2014-11-16 17:29:20	von	as I've said earlier, main security concern is a user
2014-11-16 17:29:55	jaycee	yep, you cant stop a stupid user doing stupid things
2014-11-16 17:30:24	jaycee	at some point you end up stopping the smarter user doing useful things or making it annoying for them
2014-11-16 17:30:46	von	it happens very quickly
2014-11-16 17:30:52	DerRidda	If you click a link that looks legit and you instantly get a drive-by infection there's not much you can do as user. Shouldn't use IE at all and keep your Windows patched but Windows is so horrible about how it handles its updates that some people push these out for days on end.
2014-11-16 17:31:22	von	yeah, windows update is horribly slow
2014-11-16 17:31:30	jaycee	well i'll tell you why windows makes you reboot - its to make sure that patched versions of whatever get loaded
2014-11-16 17:31:50	jaycee	sure you can update some vulnerable .so on linux, but it wont automatically be reloaded by processes already using it
2014-11-16 17:31:57	jaycee	theyll keep using the old version of the .so in memory until you restart them
2014-11-16 17:32:08	DerRidda	And you get restarts for minor things and the major things let you restart to put you in another update phase that includes another restart.
2014-11-16 17:32:16	jaycee	windows just chooses the easiest, cleanest approach which is make th user do a full restart
2014-11-16 17:32:35	jaycee	have you actually used windows since 98? doesnt sound like it :)
2014-11-16 17:32:43	von	jaycee, I'd like them to warn me if the restart is required =/
2014-11-16 17:32:45	jaycee	von, it does
2014-11-16 17:32:49	von	no it does not.
2014-11-16 17:32:55	jaycee	er, yes, it does
2014-11-16 17:32:58	von	“this update may require a reboot”
2014-11-16 17:33:00	DerRidda	Ubuntu's updater also prompts for restarts for teh stuff that needs it.
2014-11-16 17:33:04	jaycee	von, right, so there you go
2014-11-16 17:33:07	von	dammit microsoft
2014-11-16 17:33:08	von	will it, or will it not?
2014-11-16 17:33:17	jaycee	oh please
2014-11-16 17:33:22	jaycee	youre really going to pick on that?
2014-11-16 17:33:22	von	how on earth can they be not sure?
2014-11-16 17:33:34	von	it's annoying as hell
2014-11-16 17:33:37	jaycee	ubuntus updater doesnt say a restarts required until it has to do it
2014-11-16 17:33:38	von	well was
2014-11-16 17:33:49	von	now I expect every update to result in a reboot
2014-11-16 17:34:00	von	because, durr, microsoft are never sure about it anyway
2014-11-16 17:34:06	jaycee	and other distros probably just dont even bother telling you whether you need to reboot or not
2014-11-16 17:34:30	von	in linux I know what components are updated
2014-11-16 17:34:43	von	so I can restart the relevant services and reboot if necessary
2014-11-16 17:35:05	von	*which
2014-11-16 17:35:06	jaycee	right, but ask an average joe user to know that
2014-11-16 17:35:08	jaycee	they dont
2014-11-16 17:35:31	jaycee	so they just wouldnt reboot and theyd carry on with a vulnerable system until they do
2014-11-16 17:35:46	von	thankfully, I don't really have to give many fucks about average joes
2014-11-16 17:35:57	DerRidda	So do Windows users and there it's even worse.
2014-11-16 17:36:01	jaycee	right, well that is what Microsoft have to target with Windows
2014-11-16 17:36:03	von	and I'm glad my operating system respects it
2014-11-16 17:36:25	DerRidda	Because you can't disable the reboot timer many people simply disable automatic updating completely.
2014-11-16 17:36:42	Raven67854	I tend to just reboot rather than restart services but even still takes about ~8 seconds to get back to my OS
2014-11-16 17:36:43	von	thankfully, reboots on windows 8 default to in 2 days rather than in fucking 15 minutes
2014-11-16 17:36:49	DerRidda	Everybody that games a lot does that.
2014-11-16 17:37:07	DerRidda	Update runs in the background while you game, suddenly your amchine shuts down.
2014-11-16 17:37:11	Raven67854	DerRidda, Yeah I know quite a few people who just disable the updater

2014-11-16 17:37:46	jaycee	I get a little prompt that asks me to restart, or delay it for 10 minutes, an hour, 2 hours, 4 hours
2014-11-16 17:37:46	von	dunno, I usually got dat “YOU GOTTA REBOOT BRO, YOU REALLY HAVE TO, HERE, 15 MINUTES, NO? I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN IN A FEW HOURS”
2014-11-16 17:37:56	von	“AND THEN I  WILL FUCKING REBOOT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT”
2014-11-16 17:37:57	Raven67854	It gives a prompt and has a long default
2014-11-16 17:37:59	jaycee	windows does not "just restart"

2014-11-16 17:38:42	von	jaycee, actually windows 7 does reboot after you ask it to go fuck itself a few times
2014-11-16 17:38:52	jaycee	look, my machines sat there on the 15 minute prompt overnight, thats like 8 hours of me asleep :)
2014-11-16 17:38:53	DerRidda	I've had that happen to me all the time back in the day.

2014-11-16 17:39:08	von	I mean, that “reboot in 15 minutes” window, if you ask it to appear again later a couple of times
2014-11-16 17:39:09	jaycee	von, well my windows 7 pro install doesnt
2014-11-16 17:39:14	Raven67854	You get different prompts depending on what you have it set to
2014-11-16 17:39:15	von	it'll stop asking and just reboot at some point
2014-11-16 17:39:23	Raven67854	If you have to automatic updates it'll just reboot whenever it damn well pleases
2014-11-16 17:39:30	von	my windows 7 installations did that on a few occasions
2014-11-16 17:39:32	jaycee	no it doesnt. ive delayed it for 4 hours over 2 days before
2014-11-16 17:39:37	Raven67854	If you have to check for updates but let me choose to install. It's entirely different
2014-11-16 17:39:58	Raven67854	Also Windows 8 has a bad habit of resetting your update choice
2014-11-16 17:40:13	Raven67854	From whatever you set it to. To always update =/
2014-11-16 17:40:32	jaycee	i have it set to download update automatically, but it prompts me before starting to install them
2014-11-16 17:40:47	von	I usually run windows update manually after launching windows
2014-11-16 17:40:55	von	before I run it like once in a couple of months
2014-11-16 17:40:56	jaycee	and no, it has never "just changed" that setting or "just rebooted" or "just done anything" by itself
2014-11-16 17:41:10	jaycee	i only really see two classes of people coming out with this one
2014-11-16 17:41:10	Raven67854	jaycee, Windows 8 will do that.

2014-11-16 17:41:21	DerRidda	So you don't really set it to automatically update then?

2014-11-16 17:44:46	Raven67854	jaycee, directx12!
2014-11-16 17:44:51	von	lol
2014-11-16 17:44:55	Griffinstein	dang i only have 135 and 70 of those are for linux
2014-11-16 17:44:56	von	win8 was cheaper
2014-11-16 17:44:58	Raven67854	Windows 8 and 10
2014-11-16 17:45:01	von	the only reason I went with it
2014-11-16 17:45:02	kungr	von, On steam majority major titles?
2014-11-16 17:45:10	Raven67854	Griffinstein, I have 628 games give or take
2014-11-16 17:45:12	jaycee	i'll wait and see if 10 is less of a clusterfuck, it probably will be
2014-11-16 17:45:20	Raven67854	jaycee, Not really
2014-11-16 17:45:23	jaycee	win8 will be the equivalent of vista, win10 will be the equivalent of 7 :)
2014-11-16 17:45:29	Griffinstein	i see raven hits up the humble bundle sales
2014-11-16 17:45:31	Raven67854	jaycee, Whatever helps you sleep
2014-11-16 17:45:34	von	kungr, dunno what major titles you're talking about
2014-11-16 17:45:34	Raven67854	Griffinstein, Not really
2014-11-16 17:45:47	von	I haz Civ5, IWDEE, BGEE and Valve games
2014-11-16 17:45:59	 *	von iz happy
2014-11-16 17:46:00	Raven67854	jaycee, Having used 10(I know it's not finished but it's pretty much set at this point). Not a fan of fucking bing in the god damn "start menu"
2014-11-16 17:46:01	jaycee	Raven67854, well i might consider linux when it stops having third world problems the other OS's solved ages ago :P
2014-11-16 17:46:12	Raven67854	jaycee, I want you not on Linux personally
2014-11-16 17:46:18	Raven67854	But that's just me
2014-11-16 17:46:25	kungr	von, CoD, Batman, etc
2014-11-16 17:46:28	jaycee	yeah, cause i'll call out its problems for what they are :P
2014-11-16 17:46:30	von	kungr, lol
2014-11-16 17:46:46	Raven67854	jaycee, Nobody in here thinks linux is perfect except for maybe Nothing
2014-11-16 17:46:47	von	Arkham series were good though, got bored with them eventually, but they still were pretty good
2014-11-16 17:47:07	von	Raven67854, there are enough zealots in every camp, man
2014-11-16 17:47:11	Raven67854	Just get's old listening to you piss and moan about things all the time. "Linux doesn't do things the way I'm used to therefore it's bad!"
2014-11-16 17:47:13	DerRidda	Look at this thing people are complaining about that apparently doesn't exist! http://www.pcworld.com/article/259517/stop_windows_automatic_updates_from_rebooting_your_pc.html
2014-11-16 17:47:13	jaycee	Raven67854, so why do so many of you get your panties in a bunch when you start hearing devs say how xyz feature is crap
2014-11-16 17:47:14	GolliumBot	[ Stop Windows' Automatic Updates from Rebooting Your PC | PCWorld ] - www.pcworld.com
2014-11-16 17:47:15	von	ALL HAIL RMS
2014-11-16 17:47:43	kungr	von, All i am saying is with windows there is no work around
2014-11-16 17:47:45	Raven67854	jaycee, I don't. I get annoyed when people like you shove their personal bias into things and say they know better about things you know nothing about
2014-11-16 17:47:48	DerRidda	If you let Windows automatically install updates, it will reboot unless told not to.
2014-11-16 17:47:56	DerRidda	At least Windows 7.
2014-11-16 17:47:57	Raven67854	Fucking annoying as shit listening to you day in and day out
2014-11-16 17:48:21	von	DerRidda, windows 8 will do so too, but in 2 days instead of 15 minutes by default
2014-11-16 17:48:31	Raven67854	A lot of things in Linux can use improvement.
2014-11-16 17:48:35	salamanderrake	yeah
2014-11-16 17:48:41	salamanderrake	like the IDE's
2014-11-16 17:48:43	jaycee	hm i wonder if windows home edition behaves differently. my pro install has *never* automatically rebooted
2014-11-16 17:48:43	Raven67854	But so can a shit pile of things in Mac OS X and Windows
2014-11-16 17:49:12	Raven67854	jaycee, It also depends on your Windows update settings choice
2014-11-16 17:49:17	Raven67854	Set it to always update and install automatically
2014-11-16 17:49:27	Raven67854	Watch it reboot all the time
2014-11-16 17:49:30	DerRidda	My pro Vista and Ultimate 7 both did that.
2014-11-16 17:49:42	von	pro versions may indeed stay out of forced reboots after a few delays
2014-11-16 17:49:52	jaycee	Raven67854, nope thats what my girlfriends win7 ultimate install is on. it always asks before reboot
2014-11-16 17:50:09	von	I mean, they're supposed to be used in corporate environments where reboots can do some damage
2014-11-16 17:50:26	Raven67854	The only annoying issue I get with windows updater on windows 8
2014-11-16 17:50:30	jaycee	von, in a corporate environment you dont use windows update anyway, you use WSUS
2014-11-16 17:50:31	Raven67854	is it changing my fucking choice
2014-11-16 17:50:45	Raven67854	And turning back on system restore points
2014-11-16 17:50:55	von	jaycee, what I am talking about, is after asking a few times it reboots anyway
2014-11-16 17:51:03	von	but I can only talk about Home editions
2014-11-16 17:51:18	jaycee	right ive always used win7 ultimate
2014-11-16 17:51:32	Raven67854	Must of been interesting in the 90's
2014-11-16 17:51:39	von	 as I've never seen any reason to get a pirated version of pro or ultimate
2014-11-16 17:51:49	Raven67854	von, home is awful
2014-11-16 17:52:19	von	(hm, probably being pirated was the reason, but I'm fairly sure it was the case on the license I got from a friend with MSDN account)
2014-11-16 17:52:21	jaycee	in the 90's i was still mourning the loss of amigas
2014-11-16 17:52:22	Raven67854	salamanderrake, as always vim or I dunno something
2014-11-16 17:52:35	Raven67854	jaycee, apparently you were also using windows 7
2014-11-16 17:52:51	salamanderrake	non of the IDE's have a decent solution setup
2014-11-16 17:52:59	salamanderrake	they all depend on CMake/QMake
2014-11-16 17:53:05	jaycee	salamanderrake, code::blocks is fairly ok
2014-11-16 17:53:21	salamanderrake	yeah but most people don't like it because of wx stuff
2014-11-16 17:53:22	Raven67854	QtCreator is nicer if you can get around the weirdness of it
2014-11-16 17:53:44	salamanderrake	that was my main IDE until I started using KDevelop
2014-11-16 17:53:46	Raven67854	salamanderrake, getting those UE4 guys to decide on an IDE will be like pulling teeth
2014-11-16 17:53:52	jaycee	kdevelop looked ok last time i looked at it
2014-11-16 17:54:22	Raven67854	They'll probably pick that jetbrains ide in the end
2014-11-16 17:54:25	von	looking forward to virtual desktops in win10 btw, long overdue
2014-11-16 17:54:41	Raven67854	von, it's okay
2014-11-16 17:54:43	salamanderrake	if anything if RCL has his way it will be KDevelop
2014-11-16 17:54:45	DerRidda	I never use them.
2014-11-16 17:55:01	Raven67854	salamanderrake, Interesting choice
2014-11-16 17:55:07	salamanderrake	thats what he uses
2014-11-16 17:55:14	Raven67854	von, Most annoying thing is the damn start button in windows 10
2014-11-16 17:55:27	salamanderrake	I was trying to push QtCreator becaues it was simple, but its too simple.
2014-11-16 17:55:38	DerRidda	What's the thing that's being worked on that will allow live Kernel patching without reboots?
2014-11-16 17:55:39	von	Raven67854, wait, even worse than metro interface?
2014-11-16 17:55:46	jaycee	problem with IDE's on Linux is the general opinion is "ide's are for lamers, write a makefile n00b"
2014-11-16 17:55:48	Raven67854	Compressing the "Windows UI" "Metro" whatever in the hell they're called now down into the start button was just sad
2014-11-16 17:55:49	salamanderrake	there is no way to share config/target data with other project members.
2014-11-16 17:56:00	Raven67854	jaycee, There you go generalizing again
2014-11-16 17:56:21	von	jaycee, aren't there a shitton of IDE's on linux? O_o
2014-11-16 17:56:22	jaycee	Raven67854, look it up on stackoverflow
2014-11-16 17:56:33	jaycee	most of the answers are "dont use an ide"
2014-11-16 17:56:49	von	I'm no developer, but man, there are many
2014-11-16 17:56:51	Raven67854	I've always been in the camp of use whatever works for you
2014-11-16 17:56:52	Raven67854	I use vim
2014-11-16 17:56:58	von	<3 vim
2014-11-16 17:57:04	von	but again, I'm an admin, not a developer
2014-11-16 17:57:05	salamanderrake	von: yeah but they all suffer from that, let some other system deal with compiling and project generation.
2014-11-16 17:57:12	Raven67854	Everything is inferior at this point
2014-11-16 17:57:13	salamanderrake	kdevelop is crippled without cmake
2014-11-16 17:57:29	salamanderrake	and thats it, there are only three, make/qmake/cmake
2014-11-16 17:57:33	jaycee	i hate vim with a passion, im sure its a very powerful editor but it's learning curve is virtually asymptotic
2014-11-16 17:57:59	von	dunno, I've learnt it once and never looked back
2014-11-16 17:58:14	von	I've tried me some emacs and holy fuck the hotkeys =/
2014-11-16 17:58:17	Raven67854	jaycee, just stop generalizing because a few people were mean to you. And because of what you read at stackoverflow.
2014-11-16 17:58:21	jaycee	i have better things to do than remember what 4 letter command does what i want it to do
2014-11-16 17:58:29	salamanderrake	try dealing with a thousand files in one project with multiple targets
2014-11-16 17:58:31	Raven67854	I don't even think about it. I just do it
2014-11-16 17:58:59	Raven67854	It becomes very much an after thought once you get used to it
2014-11-16 17:59:07	DerRidda	: Is a shift layer key on my keyboard, so Vim can gtfo.
2014-11-16 17:59:21	von	but to be fair, out of console editors, vim is the most powerful and requires least fingerbreaking hotkeys
2014-11-16 17:59:43	Raven67854	SublimeText is pretty cool to
2014-11-16 17:59:54	salamanderrake	yeah its nice but its not an ide
2014-11-16 17:59:55	von	can't run it on remote servers :<
2014-11-16 18:00:03	von	also Caret
2014-11-16 18:00:07	von	for some reason it makes me giggle
2014-11-16 18:00:09	Raven67854	salamanderrake, Well I didn't say it was
2014-11-16 18:00:14	jaycee	if im editing something on a console then usually nano does what i need. if its anything requiring more extensive editing i do it locally
2014-11-16 18:00:30	von	different use cases
2014-11-16 18:00:54	jaycee	for the rare occasion i write any php, i use komodo edit which has enough IDE features for that particular thing, and can even edit remote files over ssh
2014-11-16 18:01:06	Raven67854	Netbeans php plugin!
2014-11-16 18:01:07	salamanderrake	yeah I even looked into sublime text 3 but it was lacking also
2014-11-16 18:01:11	von	jaycee, sshfs?
2014-11-16 18:01:32	jaycee	von, i think it just sftp/scp's the file down, edits it locally in temp, and then sftp's it back when you save
2014-11-16 18:01:41	von	ah
2014-11-16 18:01:52	von	sshfs is good stuff though, fuse in general has some neat ideas behind it
2014-11-16 18:01:52	jaycee	it works fairly well
2014-11-16 18:02:14	von	guess so
2014-11-16 18:02:55	von	after you get used to one tool, especially one as counter-intuitive as vim, it's kinda hard to switch
2014-11-16 18:02:57	jaycee	not that i write a lot of php but i tend to put it in a git repository, and just pull it on the server when im done making a load of change
2014-11-16 18:04:22	von	I'm gonna look into joe though, seems interesting.
2014-11-16 18:04:33	Griffinstein	i wish i knew how to program and make apps
2014-11-16 18:04:45	von	Griffinstein, why not learn?
2014-11-16 18:04:47	Raven67854	Griffinstein, go learn
2014-11-16 18:04:51	Raven67854	The hell is stopping you?
2014-11-16 18:05:22	jaycee	yep, plenty of learning tutorials and info online, pick a language and learn it :)
2014-11-16 18:05:23	von	my only obstacle is the fact that I find it hard to come up with a reason to write a program that requires more than bash to solve
2014-11-16 18:05:33	jaycee	just as long as it isnt java or i'll come murder you ;)
2014-11-16 18:05:36	Griffinstein	idk where to even start
2014-11-16 18:05:40	Raven67854	Griffinstein, pick Java

2014-11-16 18:06:40	Raven67854	I learned C then Basic
2014-11-16 18:06:47	Raven67854	Basic was great in my teens

2014-11-16 18:07:03	Raven67854	jaycee, neither did mine
2014-11-16 18:07:09	Raven67854	Hell they didn't come with anything

2014-11-16 18:08:08	DerRidda	I'd recommend Ruby if I didn't think learning duck typing before static typing would be a horrible disservice.
2014-11-16 18:08:12	Raven67854	von, I mean bash is useful but eh

2014-11-16 18:09:06	von	Lua is cute and customizing awesome is fun :)
2014-11-16 18:09:13	Raven67854	Pythons easy to use on Linux
2014-11-16 18:09:20	Raven67854	and you can make games/applications with it
2014-11-16 18:09:20	DerRidda	Yes Lua.
2014-11-16 18:09:47	DerRidda	You could learn it via LÖVE2D or Leadwerks and make a little game while you are on it.
2014-11-16 18:09:51	Griffinstein	i really want to look into python
2014-11-16 18:09:54	DerRidda	Or garry's Mod.
2014-11-16 18:09:55	Raven67854	von, Love2D <3
2014-11-16 18:10:07	Griffinstein	i would like to make games made just for linux
2014-11-16 18:10:18	Raven67854	Griffinstein, I just gave you a bunch of resources and von did as well(code academy has a python course). You no longer have a fucking excuse
2014-11-16 18:10:34	Griffinstein	thats what i needed
2014-11-16 18:10:37	von	I tried learning some Python
2014-11-16 18:10:55	von	but closing statements with indentation feels bizarre
2014-11-16 18:10:58	DerRidda	I really dislike the python concept of whitespace meaning something.
2014-11-16 18:10:59	von	wrong even =/
2014-11-16 18:11:13	DerRidda	^Indeed.
2014-11-16 18:11:18	Raven67854	von, yeah I've been using python a lot here lately. I have to take breaks.
2014-11-16 18:11:25	jaycee	yeah, python will be acceptable to me when they get a clue and put braceblocks or begin/end into it
2014-11-16 18:11:34	jaycee	until then it can fuck off. relying on whitespace indenting is stupid
2014-11-16 18:11:35	von	I like Ruby's concept: make it for easy of writing
2014-11-16 18:11:35	Raven67854	it's so backwards to what one is used to. But it's much more enjoyable to make GUI's with than C++
2014-11-16 18:11:57	von	Python goes with easy for reading, but forcing people to write nice readable code is futile
2014-11-16 18:12:17	DerRidda	Unless your crap doesn't work if you don't. XD
2014-11-16 18:12:23	jaycee	python breaks if you accidentally have one to many or one too less spaces
2014-11-16 18:12:34	jaycee	and pythoners seem to love whitespace for indenting
2014-11-16 18:12:39	jaycee	i hate people who dont use tabs for code indent
2014-11-16 18:12:40	Raven67854	jaycee, you really do need a python specific ide. Really helps with that issue
2014-11-16 18:12:54	von	jaycee, wait, does it care for specific quantity or just for consistency?
2014-11-16 18:13:32	jaycee	von, what i know is ive heard of python people debugging code for hours, to find out a bug is because they had an extra whitespace at the end of a line or something like that
2014-11-16 18:13:42	von	oh wow
2014-11-16 18:13:51	jaycee	yeah, fuck that noise
2014-11-16 18:13:52	von	their ides should warn them about trailing spaces then
2014-11-16 18:14:00	jaycee	well, most of em arent using an ide
2014-11-16 18:14:07	von	(my vim does)
2014-11-16 18:14:19	Raven67854	von, so does mine!
2014-11-16 18:14:23	Raven67854	Long live vim!
2014-11-16 18:14:26	von	Raven67854, airline?
2014-11-16 18:15:10	Griffinstein	ill see you guys tomorrow im going to learn some of this python lang after i get off work tomorrow. ty for the links and help
2014-11-16 18:15:24	von	you're welcome
2014-11-16 18:15:30	DerRidda	Have fun.
2014-11-16 18:16:15	von	LÖVE is interesting. There's even package in Arch's repos
2014-11-16 18:16:23	von	gonna give it a try some day, probably
2014-11-16 18:16:31	Raven67854	von, yes
2014-11-16 18:16:49	jaycee	i will get around to learning lua sometime. plenty of games using it, and it looks interesting
2014-11-16 18:16:51	Raven67854	I like 0.9.x
2014-11-16 18:16:53	jaycee	it might even replace my need for php
2014-11-16 18:16:59	Raven67854	jaycee, I doubt it
2014-11-16 18:17:01	von	for some reason I find lua cute
2014-11-16 18:17:10	Raven67854	von, tables everywhere
2014-11-16 18:17:13	von	<3
2014-11-16 18:17:19	von	and indexing arrays with 1
2014-11-16 18:17:31	Raven67854	Lua is a vile but awesome language <3
2014-11-16 18:17:54	jaycee	Raven67854, well theres frameworks like Lapis for doing stuff, and Apache/Nginx/Lighttpd all have Lua modules
2014-11-16 18:17:59	jaycee	and well.. php is just a vile language :)
2014-11-16 18:18:06	Raven67854	jaycee, but php isn't awesome
2014-11-16 18:18:14	von	so far I use more scripting languages with index 1 than index 0 xD
2014-11-16 18:18:14	Raven67854	There's nothing awesome about php
2014-11-16 18:18:22	von	lua and zsh vs bash
2014-11-16 18:18:32	Raven67854	jaycee, There's also AngelScript if you want another alternative

2014-11-16 18:18:51	jaycee	the good thing about lua too is it interfaces very easily with C
2014-11-16 18:19:00	Raven67854	Nothing_Much, sounds distasteful
2014-11-16 18:19:06	Raven67854	AngelScript interfaces with C++ easier
2014-11-16 18:19:10	jaycee	so anything i want in my web app that i cant easily do in Lua, i can do in C and interface it

2014-11-17 02:05:49	jaycee	it wouldnt be linux if there wasnt ;)
2014-11-17 02:07:09	tadzik	some of them are perhaps deprecated, but for compat reasons they will be here forever :P
2014-11-17 02:07:12	tadzik	like ifconfig
2014-11-17 02:07:37	jaycee	ifconfig's deprecated? what replaced it?
2014-11-17 02:07:45	tadzik	iproute2, so the command "ip"
2014-11-17 02:07:58	tadzik	ifconfig is actually deprecated for awfully long time
2014-11-17 02:08:04	jaycee	i bet everyone still uses ifconfig ;)
2014-11-17 02:08:16	tadzik	just nobody cares
2014-11-17 02:08:17	tadzik	exactly :)
2014-11-17 02:09:02	tadzik	one command for both "ifconfig" and "route"? Blasphemy, so complicated!

2014-11-17 02:16:32	Happy-Ferret_	I for one didn't realize ifconfig was deprecated. Been using it on all my *nix systems, including my Macs.
2014-11-17 02:16:52	von	jaycee, I don't
2014-11-17 02:17:19	von	although this results in regular failures at attempts to run something like ip a s on FreeBSD servers = /
2014-11-17 02:18:07	von	I rather like iproute2 show outputs
2014-11-17 02:22:56	Happy-Ferret_	Another one on my list of applications I'll remove from my distro. If it's not standardized, it shouldn't be included.
2014-11-17 02:23:26	jaycee	thats the thing with ipconfig, its muscle memory, ive always used that and it works
2014-11-17 02:23:37	jaycee	and tbh its not like i manually set up ip's often
2014-11-17 02:24:57	Happy-Ferret_	jaycee, ipconfig is a DOS/Windows command ;)
2014-11-17 02:25:17	jaycee	yeah meant ifconfig, i keep typing ifconfig on windows too ;)
2014-11-17 02:25:37	jaycee	and you meant windows, dos doesnt have an ip stack :)
2014-11-17 02:28:42	Happy-Ferret_	Well. Windows 95 is essentially MS DOS with a UI on top
2014-11-17 02:29:26	jaycee	it was a nasty convoluted mess of two "kernels" trying to coexist that is best forgotten about
2014-11-17 02:29:56	jaycee	im sure if MS couldve gotten away with it they wouldve pushed NT from day 1
2014-11-17 02:31:26	von	jaycee, I've asked a collegue of mine who's an experienced anykey about that forced reboot thing on windows 7. He says there are some very rare cases of overly critical updates that reboot your system without even asking you about it.
2014-11-17 02:31:54	jaycee	von, well i cant say ive ever had them happen tbh.. but well yeah, rare cases then
2014-11-17 02:31:59	jaycee	not "windows always does it"
2014-11-17 02:32:08	jaycee	maybe Home edition does, i dunno
2014-11-17 02:32:50	jaycee	but thats a bit like saying all bikes have 4 wheels because your first scooter had trainers on it :)
2014-11-17 02:32:51	mirv_	some edition used to
2014-11-17 02:33:33	von	yeah, that might have been an overreaction on my part, but I'd rather have windows at least warn me about that kind of shit
2014-11-17 02:33:49	von	even in extremely rare cases
2014-11-17 02:34:18	mirv_	it used to forcibly reboot unless the user explicitly interrupted the countdown
2014-11-17 02:34:32	jaycee	ive never seen a countdown on my system
2014-11-17 02:34:38	mirv_	they changed that to just give an annoying popup
2014-11-17 02:34:40	jaycee	not from WU anyway
2014-11-17 02:34:53	mirv_	can't remember if it was vista or 7
2014-11-17 02:34:54	jaycee	yeah, and if you want to stop that you can just do "net stop wuauserv" :)
2014-11-17 02:35:15	von	yeah, that windows 7 still does. It opens a window with a countdown and an ability to say “fuck off, remind later” with a choice ranging from 15 minutes to 4 hours

2014-11-17 02:35:38	jaycee	mine doesnt, it opens a requester saying restart now, or remind me in x minutes
2014-11-17 02:36:04	von	windows 8 doesn't show any windows at all, it just shows a warning in metro interface that if you don't reboot in 2 days, it will do it itself
2014-11-17 02:36:23	jaycee	theres probably some registry value you can set somewhere though
2014-11-17 02:36:42	von	yeah, likely
2014-11-17 02:36:43	jaycee	i think they make the right choice in a consumer OS, if you dont nag the user into rebooting, they never will, then complain when they get pwned
2014-11-17 02:36:46	von	hidden away
2014-11-17 02:36:53	von	and barely documented anywhere
2014-11-17 02:38:04	jaycee	heh apparently no, its right there in group policies
2014-11-17 02:38:24	von	hm
2014-11-17 02:38:27	jaycee	or you can set the registry key yourself
2014-11-17 02:39:42	von	yeah, I'm aware that it can be done with the registry

2014-11-17 02:45:09	Happy-Ferret_	jaycee, in that case why not just spend the necessary R&D on finding a way to update the kernel without rebooting? IMHO, there should be a warning popup telling the user that he's barred access from some services until the installation of the update. However, standard userspace applications should still work as expected.
2014-11-17 02:55:31	jaycee	well its a tricky problem as nothing does it
2014-11-17 02:56:15	jaycee	i dunno actually, qnx used to tout that sort of thing as a value, but well. who used qnx

2014-11-17 04:33:36	kkit	Happy-Ferret_: it seems silly to have a whole distro dedicated to it, rather than some packages to install
2014-11-17 04:35:25	Happy-Ferret_	kkit, well. He basically wants something like AROS but with a patched Amiga OS 3.* m68k kernel at it's core.
2014-11-17 04:35:54	kkit	ah, so it wouldn't just be reinventing the wheel

2014-11-17 04:36:03	Happy-Ferret_	There's at least one distro already doing it. Amikit 7 Amipub. There also was X-Amiga
2014-11-17 04:37:08	jaycee	AROS isnt linux anyway, its a complete implementation of AmigaOS on x86. A Linux kernel for 68k amigas is pretty pointless
2014-11-17 04:37:17	jaycee	itd only really run well on 040s and 060s
2014-11-17 04:37:50	jaycee	and 060 accelerators were pretty rare, motorola didnt make the processor for long
2014-11-17 04:38:10	Happy-Ferret_	Personally, if I was "hardcore" enough I'd roll out a NetBSD based Amiga OS clone with support for the Amiga Fast File System and a stable userland. Basically what Amiga Inc and the other zealots should've done a long time ago.
2014-11-17 04:38:48	jaycee	they briefly jumped in bed with qnx, its a bed they shouldve stayed in
2014-11-17 04:39:00	jaycee	the qnx kernel is pretty cool
2014-11-17 04:39:29	Happy-Ferret_	jaycee, it's supposed to be an emulated OS. Not running on the real hardware. He basically wants an x86 Linux kernel booting into a framebuffer version of E-UAE (which then boots into Amiga OS). Pretty straightforward.
2014-11-17 04:40:00	jaycee	heh i seem to recall there was a thing that already did that
2014-11-17 04:40:23	jaycee	tbh all the really cool stuff is in winuae anyway
2014-11-17 04:40:41	jaycee	i think he's submitted some of it back to UAE
2014-11-17 04:41:55	jaycee	qnx was awesome when it came out. i remember the demo floppy they had
2014-11-17 04:42:09	jaycee	had a gui, full tcp stack and a web browser on it. on one HD floppy
2014-11-17 04:42:12	Happy-Ferret_	Personally, I think most of the defining parts of the "distro" will be in the Amiga side of things. There are some pretty cool things one can apply to Amiga OS.
2014-11-17 04:43:22	Happy-Ferret_	In fact, Cloanto recently released a set of new Amiga OS 3.1 floppies that include some new patches (essentially making it Amiga OS 3.2 or Amiga OS 3.1 Final Edition).
2014-11-17 04:43:51	jaycee	i hate that theyre still trying to commercially exploit it
2014-11-17 04:43:58	jaycee	just make it freeware already
2014-11-17 04:44:10	Happy-Ferret_	Wish I could the Amiga 1200 I bought from Petro working. The floppy drive is broken, it appears.

2014-11-17 04:59:19	jaycee	i think the amiga is where i really learned programming
2014-11-17 04:59:47	jaycee	its sad that most people remember it as a glorified games console, when it was a really awesome computer in general
2014-11-17 05:00:03	Cheeseness	AmigaBasic and AMOS were my first languages
2014-11-17 05:00:11	jaycee	if commodore had had more foresight, they would have totally pissed on apple
2014-11-17 05:00:26	Cheeseness	I don't know if it was about foresight so much as management
2014-11-17 05:00:41	jaycee	both tbh
2014-11-17 05:00:54	Cheeseness	I guess bad management will never have good foresight
2014-11-17 05:01:00	jaycee	they didnt realise the technology they had until too late, and by then bad management had screwed the company

2014-11-17 05:05:55	@liamdawe	i miss my amiga days7
2014-11-17 05:06:04	@liamdawe	playing endless hours of dune 2
2014-11-17 05:06:28	Cheeseness	Deluxe Paint was my first digital painting program
2014-11-17 05:06:32	jaycee	it was very depressing when i finally realised the amiga was not going to come back, and built my first PC in about 1998
2014-11-17 05:06:44	Cheeseness	You waited till 1998?
2014-11-17 05:06:47	jaycee	actually no it was 1997
2014-11-17 05:06:58	jaycee	late 97 i think
2014-11-17 05:07:22	jaycee	heh yes, i had been saving money to buy some serious amiga hardware, an accelerator etc, i had already towerised my A1200
2014-11-17 05:07:30	jaycee	a friend had an 030/50
2014-11-17 05:07:50	jaycee	i was at college and a friend showed me his p120 running Doom faster than any amiga ever could. then Quake
2014-11-17 05:07:51	Cheeseness	The Amiga factory was closed in like 1994, wasn't it?
2014-11-17 05:08:11	jaycee	Quake came out on the Amiga and it was just deadly slow. i realised it was game over and that they just werent going to get anywhere fast
2014-11-17 05:08:27	jaycee	Cheeseness, Escom owned them for a while and continued manufacture and r&d
2014-11-17 05:08:29	Cheeseness	It did? I had no idea it was released for the Amiga
2014-11-17 05:08:33	jaycee	but they expanded too quick and went bankrupt
2014-11-17 05:08:42	Cheeseness	Ah, k
2014-11-17 05:09:12	mirv_	liamdawe, Dune 2 still stands out for me as what an RTS should be
2014-11-17 05:09:41	jaycee	i think the final nail was i went to World of Amiga 99 (where i met what was to become Virtual Programming) and the owners of Amiga were basically promising the moon on a stick, and it just didnt ring true
2014-11-17 05:09:46	jaycee	sure enough, a few months later, it fell apart
2014-11-17 05:10:56	jaycee	the problem with the amiga other than commodore, was that the hardware was simply too tightly integrated, when it became dated it was hard to do anything about it
2014-11-17 05:11:24	jaycee	AGA was a good example, the 256 colour mode never should have been planar, but making it non-planar wouldve broken too many things
2014-11-17 05:11:40	jaycee	and made the much-touted Blitter useless
2014-11-17 05:12:27	jaycee	it was already at the point where if you had an 030, doing software blits was faster overall than using the blitter was
2014-11-17 05:16:11	flesk_	I put countless hours into The Patrician on the Amiga.

2014-11-17 05:17:53	@liamdawe	yeah that's what i tried, but on Linux is was crappy7
2014-11-17 05:18:52	Cheeseness	Yeah, UAE often seems a bit less developed (which is disappointing)

2014-11-17 05:22:07	jaycee	the amiga had true preemptive multitasking while the PC still had DOS, and apple just about had cooperative multitasking

2014-11-17 05:22:16	@liamdawe	amiga forever states linux support on wikipedia, but the website only lists windows, annoying

2014-11-17 05:42:58	jaycee	the thing that was frustrating was going over to the PC and then waiting for the PC to catch up to where the Amiga had been technology wise

2014-11-17 05:44:02	Tag_	I thought at that time that atari was better
2014-11-17 05:44:09	jaycee	you know, the atari ST was the machine Atari made when the deal fell through on them buying the Amiga ? :)
2014-11-17 05:44:21	Tag_	i didn't know that
2014-11-17 05:44:24	Cheeseness	When I go back to revisit old games, I'm always disappointed by how crappy the audio in the DOS versions of stuff is
2014-11-17 05:44:39	Tag_	but in fact, at that time, atari st and amiga 500 was like ps3 / xbox 360 :D
2014-11-17 05:44:45	jaycee	yep, right until the last minute, Atari were going to buy out Amiga. At the last minute, Commodore came along and bought them
2014-11-17 05:45:14	Tag_	i mean, the were the big players, with awesome graphics
2014-11-17 05:45:32	Tag_	you had the 8 bit version of the games, but on the back of the game's boxes you saw the 16 bit screenshots
2014-11-17 05:45:42	jaycee	the big problem with atari was a) the shitty OS, b) they shouldve skipped ST and gone straight to STe
2014-11-17 05:46:02	jaycee	the falcon was great hardware wise but still stuck with that crappy OS
2014-11-17 05:46:02	Tag_	it was unfair, because you bought the game thinking it would look like that and then you found your computer was crap XD
2014-11-17 05:46:44	jaycee	maybe we should tell the kids how fun it was loading games off tape ;)

2014-11-17 06:30:35	tadzik	it has yearly releases with tons of new features
2014-11-17 06:30:52	tadzik	and the gap between 5.20 and 5.8 that centos runs is quite massive

2014-11-17 07:38:03	von	hm
2014-11-17 07:38:16	jaycee	the click is your sound card or whatever picking up the RF noise generated by the spark across the switch
2014-11-17 07:38:31	jaycee	grounding would help if its in a metal box as it would act as a shield
2014-11-17 07:40:33	jaycee	but the real truth is "it depends". if the wiring is old enough to not have any grounding then theres probably allsorts of nastiness going on
2014-11-17 07:41:08	jaycee	but a stabiliser certainly wont help, that would only protect you against very noisy power (youd hear it all the time) or frequent brownouts
2014-11-17 07:41:22	von	I don't think even modern Russian multiflat houses have their whole grid properly grounded

2014-11-17 07:45:46	von	although I can guess these clicks may eventually do some harm to the mixer
2014-11-17 07:45:57	jaycee	do you get a tingle if you touch your pc case and a water pipe or radiator or something ?
2014-11-17 07:46:29	von	haven't tried it yet. You mean if someone is using pipes for grounding?
2014-11-17 07:46:52	jaycee	well, more the effect of uncoupled mains input filtering
2014-11-17 07:47:05	DerRidda	No, because the pipes go into the ground, you will ground your PC.
2014-11-17 07:47:16	von	I'll try it once I'm back home
2014-11-17 07:47:18	jaycee	pretty much every switch mode power supply with a ground terminal expects to use the ground as part of the filter
2014-11-17 07:47:27	jaycee	including a pc power supply
2014-11-17 07:47:50	jaycee	you quite often find with no ground connected, your pc's case floats at half mains voltage. fortunately, not with any sort of current that'd kill you, but youd feel a tingle
2014-11-17 07:48:16	jaycee	DerRidda, yes you can use a water pipe as a ground point, but doing so is often illegal as it can be dangerous
2014-11-17 07:48:36	DerRidda	I'm not saying he should do it.

2014-11-17 07:49:41	jaycee	von, no the real danger is that the water pipe is not a good enough ground (too high impedance). then, rather than trip the breaker, the whole water system just becomes live instead

2014-11-17 07:54:03	jaycee	grounding (or earthing as we call it here) is mandatory. an installation without one (domestically, theres some exceptions commercially) is not allowed and they will disconnect you from the grid until the wiring is brought up to date
2014-11-17 07:54:47	jaycee	its also illegal to work on or extend an old, out of date installation. if you find old wiring that isnt compliant, you must re-wire

2014-11-17 08:02:17	von	thanks
2014-11-17 08:04:10	tadzik	it's usually undesirable to use it directly though (like $_ = "foo" # I'm lazy)
2014-11-17 08:04:29	von	err, how do you use it then?
2014-11-17 08:04:34	von	is it assigned automatically?
2014-11-17 08:04:44	tadzik	yes, quite often

2014-11-17 10:56:11	Osirez	Downloading War Thunder now. :)
2014-11-17 10:56:12	disharmonic	hey
2014-11-17 10:56:27	Osirez	And will be trying FL Studio under Wine later... sometime,lol.
2014-11-17 10:56:57	xpander69	dont forget wineasio and JACK then :D
2014-11-17 10:57:12	Griffinstein	sup guys
2014-11-17 10:57:22	Osirez	Got the wineasio thing down but do i need jack?
2014-11-17 10:57:23	xpander69	i tried to learn some native programs like Renoise and Bitwig Studios..but damn its hard to start learning a new one:D
2014-11-17 10:57:39	xpander69	Osirez, yes..wineasio works only with pure alsa or JACK
2014-11-17 10:57:40	Griffinstein	bitwig is where it is at
2014-11-17 10:57:47	xpander69	JACK provides ultra low latency
2014-11-17 10:58:14	Osirez	Hmmm, okay. I hate messing with jack... :/
2014-11-17 10:58:26	xpander69	i actually run JACK audio constantly now..pulseaudio is configured to have JACK sink and source for input as well
2014-11-17 10:58:29	xpander69	so anything passes it
2014-11-17 10:58:46	von	xpander69, does it work on wake up after suspend?
2014-11-17 10:58:53	Osirez	Havent gotten the chance to try bitwig yet
2014-11-17 10:58:54	Griffinstein	hey xpander69 did you know lmms can open flp files
2014-11-17 10:58:58	xpander69	also SSR recording with jack is easier..cause it has both mic and speaker record options
2014-11-17 10:59:06	xpander69	von, no suspend needed
2014-11-17 10:59:26	von	I rather like the quite of suspended PC while I sleep
2014-11-17 10:59:29	von	*quiet
2014-11-17 10:59:36	Raven67854	xpander69, how do you get war thunder to work on your screens? Do you turn them off?
2014-11-17 10:59:51	xpander69	Raven67854, no
2014-11-17 10:59:52	Osirez	The Steam version just work

2014-11-17 11:00:19	Raven67854	xpander69, It won't run on my main monitor =/
2014-11-17 11:00:20	Raven67854	It breaks
2014-11-17 11:00:27	xpander69	strange
2014-11-17 11:00:39	xpander69	crappy WM maybe?
2014-11-17 11:00:40	Raven67854	xpander69, I'll give it another look see later today

2014-11-17 11:02:06	Raven67854	Samsai, I just never understand the appeal of mint
2014-11-17 11:02:19	@Samsai	Raven67854, i guess it looks pretty
2014-11-17 11:02:23	Griffinstein	i really like the mate mint menu

2014-11-17 11:03:03	xpander69	:D
2014-11-17 11:03:05	xpander69	works fine
2014-11-17 11:03:15	Raven67854	xpander69, xchat says no to you adding :D
2014-11-17 11:03:25	@Samsai	hexchat says yes
2014-11-17 11:03:26	xpander69	hexchat makes wonders
2014-11-17 11:03:31	@Samsai	so your client is inferior
2014-11-17 11:03:33	Griffinstein	hexchat woo
2014-11-17 11:03:35	xpander69	indeed
2014-11-17 11:03:36	@Samsai	irc client wars, engage
2014-11-17 11:03:36	Raven67854	Yeah I should switch to hexchat
2014-11-17 11:03:42	Raven67854	I use hexchat on windows when I ran windows
2014-11-17 11:03:48	stqn	pidgin works too ;)
2014-11-17 11:03:55	xpander69	windows has irc clients?

2014-11-17 11:03:58	Raven67854	xpander69, yes
2014-11-17 11:04:00	Raven67854	hexchat
2014-11-17 11:04:09	von	even in my rxvt-unicode this link works lol
2014-11-17 11:04:14	von	(weechat yaaay)
2014-11-17 11:04:27	Raven67854	Samsai, best part is how hexchat spawned off of xchat <3
2014-11-17 11:04:45	@Samsai	Raven67854, and then xchat died
2014-11-17 11:04:45	xpander69	Raven67854, yes they fixed link handling it seems:D
2014-11-17 11:04:45	@Samsai	the end
2014-11-17 11:05:03	von	xpander69, iirc mIRC, which was the most popular irc client a while ago is a windows-only program
2014-11-17 11:05:03	Raven67854	On windows I used to use hydrairc
2014-11-17 11:05:06	Raven67854	mmm them days
2014-11-17 11:05:07	mETz	yup, now they just have to clean up the mess left from xchat
2014-11-17 11:05:35	von	I used xchat on windows back in the days when the official version was free
2014-11-17 11:05:35	mETz	most dialogs are quite unintuitive
2014-11-17 11:06:09	Raven67854	"would you like a review key of our game?"
2014-11-17 11:06:13	Raven67854	"Does it have Linux support"
2014-11-17 11:06:19	Raven67854	"It has PC support"
2014-11-17 11:06:25	Osirez	^ Buhahaha
2014-11-17 11:06:26	Raven67854	"PC as in personal computer or windows"
2014-11-17 11:06:28	Raven67854	"Windows"
2014-11-17 11:06:30	Raven67854	No thank you
2014-11-17 11:06:32	Raven67854	the end
2014-11-17 11:06:44	xpander69	Raven67854, i get some of those as well from time to time
2014-11-17 11:07:10	@Samsai	i get none, and i'm happy
2014-11-17 11:07:41	xpander69	i also get lots of "Would you like to join our network... "
2014-11-17 11:07:47	xpander69	though im in TGN
2014-11-17 11:07:47	@Samsai	all of the review keys go through GOL and those titles tend to have linux support in place
2014-11-17 11:08:05	Raven67854	I'm apart of curse and get those
2014-11-17 11:08:08	@Samsai	except ns2: combat, which still doesn't have binaries in place
2014-11-17 11:08:08	Raven67854	they tell me curse sucks
2014-11-17 11:08:13	Osirez	I get those network requests also Xpander
2014-11-17 11:08:14	Raven67854	I get 90% of the 60% youtube gives out
2014-11-17 11:08:19	Raven67854	Fuck yeah I have a sweet deal
2014-11-17 11:08:50	Raven67854	You offering me 60% of 60% is not a sweet deal. While being locked in for 3 years
2014-11-17 11:08:59	xpander69	i dont know how much i get... all i can say is that it wont cut it for being my main thing :D
2014-11-17 11:09:15	xpander69	i get like 18 dollars per month or so i think:D
2014-11-17 11:09:21	Osirez	Now thats the truth.
2014-11-17 11:09:32	Raven67854	I get a few hundred a month
2014-11-17 11:09:35	xpander69	my goal was to get as much as my network connection bill is..but i have failed:D
2014-11-17 11:09:40	Raven67854	It's still not nearly enough
2014-11-17 11:10:54	Osirez	XD
2014-11-17 11:11:46	Griffinstein	hey raven im going to start learning python today

2014-11-17 11:12:12	Griffinstein	can you make decent games with python
2014-11-17 11:12:17	Raven67854	Yes
2014-11-17 11:12:29	von	you can mod a lot of stuff with lua
2014-11-17 11:12:32	Raven67854	Will you be making the next shining jewel in terms of visuals no
2014-11-17 11:12:33	Griffinstein	do you need a game engine or do you make your own

2014-11-17 11:12:50	Raven67854	Crea for example uses python for scripting
2014-11-17 11:13:05	Raven67854	Griffinstein, No use pygame. I sent you 2 books yesterday. One teaches you pygame
2014-11-17 11:13:20	Raven67854	Afterwards if python can't do what you want. Then you can move on to other things
2014-11-17 11:13:25	xpander69	so that FC4 from Ubicrap is DX11 only yeah? no way to run under wine then i guess

2014-11-17 11:14:36	xpander69	under wine
2014-11-17 11:14:45	Raven67854	when people on windows have issues using it or playing a game
2014-11-17 11:14:48	Raven67854	You aren't doing it on wine
2014-11-17 11:15:09	Osirez	I have no problems with uplay under windows...
2014-11-17 11:15:15	xpander69	its a FC3 reskin anyway..nothing reallym new it seems
2014-11-17 11:15:26	Raven67854	xpander69, yeah sure with much higher system requirements :p
2014-11-17 11:15:27	xpander69	so yeah..and since i dont have windblows i cant play anyway:D
2014-11-17 11:15:52	Raven67854	Exactly
2014-11-17 11:16:05	xpander69	and we have so many good native games

2014-11-17 11:17:10	von	if you have a problem to solve with programming, it can be very fun

2014-11-17 11:39:14	xpander69	well i have found it.. http://www.returnofreckoning.com/index.php ...but its alpha and it has even more bugs than the EA one had(which was a lot also) ... + it runs pretty bad in wine and needs wine patching

2014-11-17 16:21:55	DrMcCoy	I never had problems with that
2014-11-17 16:22:07	DrMcCoy	Didn't need to replace any libraries or anything
2014-11-17 16:22:23	mirv_	oh no, it's listing emul-linux-* packages!
2014-11-17 16:22:27	jaycee	apart from some alsa thingummy that crashed my new openal-soft ? ;)
2014-11-17 16:22:33	DrMcCoy	mirv_: yes
2014-11-17 16:22:44	DrMcCoy	jaycee: I still blame you for that
2014-11-17 16:22:45	mirv_	I want to stab those
2014-11-17 16:22:54	stqn	that page seems to recommend using a 32 bit chroot
2014-11-17 16:23:03	jaycee	DrMcCoy, whatever :)
2014-11-17 16:23:41	jaycee	if its out of date in steam-runtime, go moan at valve :)
2014-11-17 16:23:52	mirv_	DrMcCoy, ABI_X86="32 64" is much, much better than using the emul-linux-* packages
2014-11-17 16:23:59	DrMcCoy	jaycee: Naw, blaming you is easier
2014-11-17 16:24:10	mirv_	particularly if you're using Mesa
2014-11-17 16:24:14	stqn	valve won’t listen !
2014-11-17 16:24:22	DrMcCoy	mirv_: Hmm, okay
2014-11-17 16:24:44	DrMcCoy	Well, I had an nvidia card in that system I ran Gentoo on
2014-11-17 16:24:58	mirv_	it'll dump its own 32bit libgl in there
2014-11-17 16:25:16	mirv_	but Mesa doesn't build a 32bit one unless you tell it to
2014-11-17 16:25:30	mirv_	and the emul-linux-x86-opengl stuff is....old
2014-11-17 16:28:28	stqn	mirv_: I can’t find any doc in the wiki for abi_x86
2014-11-17 16:29:00	stqn	there’s mention of a "future"(?) abi_x86_32 flag…
2014-11-17 16:30:07	mirv_	stqn, yeah, they're still sorting out how best to choose between emul-linux-* and the abi_x86 stuff
2014-11-17 16:32:03	mirv_	I just set in make.conf: ABI_X86="32 64"
2014-11-17 16:32:20	mirv_	going forward, packages should observe that and build appropriately
2014-11-17 16:32:52	stqn	mirv_: will that build *all* packages in both versions, or just libraries?
2014-11-17 16:33:17	mirv_	stqn, not all packages support it, so it's generally just libraries
2014-11-17 16:33:33	stqn	ok, seems good…
2014-11-17 16:33:38	mirv_	it's really on a package basis though
2014-11-17 16:33:52	mirv_	I've had no problems with it - quite the reverse, it's been much better for me
2014-11-17 16:34:08	stqn	mirv_: and it’s already enough to make steam and games run?
2014-11-17 16:34:16	mirv_	yes
2014-11-17 16:34:20	stqn	cool
2014-11-17 16:34:52	mirv_	I extract steam from the .deb file, put it in a folder, run the script, and away I go
2014-11-17 16:35:42	mirv_	I'm going to bed really soon, but poke me tomorrow if you run into any problems and I'll help you out
2014-11-17 16:36:06	stqn	thanks
2014-11-17 16:36:20	mirv_	which video drivers are you using, btw?
2014-11-17 16:36:45	stqn	I’m still running gentoo in a VM so not sure how far I’ll go
2014-11-17 16:36:57	mirv_	ok
2014-11-17 16:37:00	stqn	should be the virtualbox driver … later nvidia
2014-11-17 16:37:48	mirv_	I can help out later if you feel like switching between nvidia & noveau at boot time (if/when you get that far)
2014-11-17 16:40:09	mirv_	(that's mostly just for fun)
2014-11-17 16:40:46	mirv_	oh, wiki got updated: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Steam/Manual_installation

2014-11-17 22:16:06	von	but every statement seems to have to be terminated with a semicolon
2014-11-17 22:16:40	DrMcCoy	Well, C does that too. C++ too
2014-11-17 22:16:43	von	which is annoying since I've been mostly dealing with shells, lua and Ruby until now
2014-11-17 22:17:00	DrMcCoy	And Pascal uses ; as a statement separator
2014-11-17 22:17:31	Leftmost	If you're going to do much programming, you'll want to get used to semicolons.
2014-11-17 22:17:43	von	guess so

2014-11-17 23:53:02	FutureSuture	That's because it's C&Q, not C&D

2014-11-17 23:53:50	FutureSuture	I wrote C&Q
2014-11-17 23:53:55	lemon_snowCone	fail
2014-11-17 23:53:57	FutureSuture	It's C&C
2014-11-17 23:54:13	bluedogslim	These are all compatible games with linux?
2014-11-17 23:54:20	FutureSuture	bluedogslim, correct.

2014-11-17 23:54:38	bluedogslim	Where are you guys downloading them?
2014-11-17 23:54:44	FutureSuture	bluedogslim, Linux has plenty of open source games. You purchase games through GOG and Steam as well.

2014-11-18 00:04:05	lemon_snowCone	:P
2014-11-18 00:04:12	FutureSuture	Why, what did you do
2014-11-18 00:04:15	lemon_snowCone	nothing
2014-11-18 00:04:27	lemon_snowCone	they violated the contract agreements and tried to sue me
2014-11-18 00:04:41	FutureSuture	So they violate it...and then try and sue you?
2014-11-18 00:05:00	lemon_snowCone	yep
2014-11-18 00:05:14	FutureSuture	That...does not seem like a case they can win...
2014-11-18 00:05:16	lemon_snowCone	my response was: LOL i never signed that contract (was mde 4 years ago) you cant do jack to me as I have no legal obligation to do anything for you. Lets go to court, I want free money
2014-11-18 00:05:37	lemon_snowCone	2 days later I get an email from their boss apologizing
2014-11-18 00:05:44	lemon_snowCone	fucking corporates
2014-11-18 00:06:02	FutureSuture	I assume you do coding work for different clients. Does that include clients outside India?

2014-11-18 00:06:20	lemon_snowCone	there are some military contracts
2014-11-18 00:06:33	lemon_snowCone	but I cant touch those until I get vetted and have a larger portfolio
2014-11-18 00:06:41	FutureSuture	Ahhh
2014-11-18 00:06:48	FutureSuture	So you do what Raven67854 does, really
2014-11-18 00:06:53	FutureSuture	Freelancing, no?
2014-11-18 00:06:55	lemon_snowCone	yeah

2014-11-18 00:07:46	FutureSuture	You should start porting games to Linux like Ryan Gordon <3
2014-11-18 00:08:00	lemon_snowCone	does it pay? no? not interested
2014-11-18 00:08:31	lemon_snowCone	right now the only thing I give a damn about is paying rent and bills
2014-11-18 00:08:37	lemon_snowCone	I can barely do that
2014-11-18 00:08:45	FutureSuture	It does pay. o_O
2014-11-18 00:08:51	lemon_snowCone	then no
2014-11-18 00:09:09	lemon_snowCone	lost quiet a bit of cash from non payments
2014-11-18 00:09:18	FutureSuture	So whether it pays or not, it's a no. :P

2014-11-18 00:10:01	lemon_snowCone	FutureSuture, until Im a bit more financially the stable the answer is always going to be no

2014-11-18 00:10:30	FutureSuture	Porting proprietary games from Windows to Linux in exchange for cash.
2014-11-18 00:10:42	lemon_snowCone	lets also consider the fact I have no idea how to develop and deploy linux games
2014-11-18 00:11:03	lemon_snowCone	Im just building up my skill set for now
2014-11-18 00:11:28	FutureSuture	I see

2014-11-18 00:11:48	FutureSuture	Raven67854 has a GTX Titan, and you can barely pay the bills. Puzzling. :/
2014-11-18 00:12:36	lemon_snowCone	how so?

2014-11-18 01:37:46	Sik	Honestly I don't know how different it is in practice
2014-11-18 01:37:48	tadzik	what do you mean it's not a brand
2014-11-18 01:38:02	mirv_	tadzik, it's a collective work of many, many, many developers
2014-11-18 01:38:04	von	we have so many wms / des that a different UI can't be the reason to stop calling something linux
2014-11-18 01:38:05	tadzik	it's a name of a thing that is known to have no games

2014-11-18 01:40:26	tadzik	how does valve distance themselves any more than they do, by merely changing the label?
2014-11-18 01:40:52	mirv_	it's the implication that steamos is somehow not Linux
2014-11-18 01:46:00	okb	I don't think it implies that.

2014-11-18 01:46:52	flesk_	Well, if they're going to succeed with their Steam machines they're going to have to appeal to a lot of people who don't have the faintest idea of what Linux is.
2014-11-18 01:46:59	Beamboom	I see it as purely marketing strategy. SteamOS is an OS that runs Steam, and that's what it is (from a user perspective).

2014-11-18 01:48:05	tadzik	and when it does, it does it slowly
2014-11-18 01:48:10	Beamboom	yes
2014-11-18 01:48:21	flesk_	tadzik: Yeah, exactly. I think it's a good move to distance it from conventional desktop OSes, since it makes more sense to compare it to whatever runs on a PS4 or an Xbone.
2014-11-18 01:48:29	tadzik	agreed
2014-11-18 01:48:44	Beamboom	In fact I am very happy that Valve has done this, cause it enables Linux to start with a "clean slate" so to say
2014-11-18 01:49:28	Beamboom	I mean, Amdroid is essentially a variation of Linux too, but I have no objections to them calling it Android.
2014-11-18 01:49:52	flesk_	Most people who use computers to play games are probably savvy enough to know that SteamOS is just a fancy name for a Linux distro anyway.
2014-11-18 01:50:05	tadzik	not the console people though :P
2014-11-18 01:50:24	tadzik	also, I think you overestimate how most computer users are
2014-11-18 01:50:29	Beamboom	Those who care do know. But the mainstream, the very mainstream, don't really know what it means.
2014-11-18 01:50:30	flesk_	tadzik: Yeah, and I think that's ok, as it would just confuse them.
2014-11-18 01:50:41	flesk_	That might be true. ;)
2014-11-18 01:50:42	Beamboom	Exactly tadzik
2014-11-18 01:51:24	tadzik	gamers like to think that they know so much about computers because they know what gpu they have, most of the time
2014-11-18 01:51:36	flesk_	Beamboom: Yeah, I think so too, which is a point in favour of just calling it SteamOS instead of "muddling" the nomenclature with Linux.
2014-11-18 01:52:21	Beamboom	Indeed flesk_
2014-11-18 01:52:39	Beamboom	Keep "Linux" out of it. Those who care knows, don't confuse the rest.
2014-11-18 01:52:45	von	hmm, I need a new hotkey for tmux =/
2014-11-18 01:52:58	flesk_	And as you said further up, a lot of people think of Linux as something inherently user unfriendly, and that runs the risk of turning people off SteamOS.
2014-11-18 01:52:58	tadzik	the default is only a bit better than screen's
2014-11-18 01:53:01	tadzik	and still godawful
2014-11-18 01:53:02	von	C-B is useful for emacs-like navigation in commandline
2014-11-18 01:53:24	von	and C-A too
2014-11-18 01:53:42	tadzik	I used C-\ in screen
2014-11-18 01:53:49	tadzik	in tmux I still didn't bother to change the default
2014-11-18 01:55:17	Beamboom	And quite frankly, it *is* unfriendly for those who's not really into computing/unix way of things.
2014-11-18 01:55:35	Beamboom	It's become better, but there's still plenty of quirks
2014-11-18 01:55:44	von	tadzik, I think I'll go with C-Space
2014-11-18 01:55:56	von	I don't think it's widely used anywhere
2014-11-18 01:56:01	tadzik	good idea
2014-11-18 01:56:20	von	and as I have Ctrl mapped on Caps
2014-11-18 01:57:08	mirv_	probably shouldn't have said anything - my opinion hasn't changed, but I'd rather the conversation not continue
2014-11-18 01:57:14	mirv_	lest it get too heated
2014-11-18 02:02:10	Beamboom	The SteamOS discussion you mean? No heat to be found here - surely we can discuss in a proper manner? :)
2014-11-18 02:02:39	Beamboom	I don't think it's so much of a big deal for anyone to get upset about. Just keep politics and religion out of it. :p
2014-11-18 02:02:57	mirv_	except some treat Valve as a religion
2014-11-18 02:03:04	mirv_	that's why I want to be careful
2014-11-18 02:03:27	mirv_	although...broad overtones of Half-Life...
2014-11-18 02:03:35	 *	Sik is back from domesticating dog... don't ask, he tried to eat the money o_o
2014-11-18 02:03:42	von	D:
2014-11-18 02:03:51	Sik	That said, since we're talking about Linux rants, something else I remembered while I was wrestling with the dog
2014-11-18 02:04:16	Sik	See, one of the reasons for having Sol on Linux is to help bring legitimacy to the platform (we'll need more than one game for that, but anything helps)
2014-11-18 02:04:34	von	it's GNU/Linux!
2014-11-18 02:04:39	von	ALL HAIL RMS
2014-11-18 02:04:40	Sik	So it really irks me when people tell me to just do a half-assed job because it isn't as important (market share-wise) as Windows
2014-11-18 02:04:43	mirv_	von, was waiting for that!
2014-11-18 02:04:52	Sik	Yes, that shit happens
2014-11-18 02:04:55	von	mirv_, you're welcome :)
2014-11-18 02:05:15	Sik	I was implementing screen reader support and people seemed upset that I was focusing on Speech-dispatcher (Linux) before SAPI (Windows)
2014-11-18 02:05:36	Sik	Despite the fact that 1) I had found the information and libraries for the former first and 2) it's the very platform I'm using right now
2014-11-18 02:05:40	Beamboom	"Sol"? Enlighten a n00b please
2014-11-18 02:05:48	Sik	http://sol.azurasun.com/

2014-11-18 02:06:14	Sik	Being delayed more than it should due to music but eh :/ (should have been out long ago otherwise)
2014-11-18 02:06:48	Beamboom	Ah you're involved in that project? Looks like an indie game right?
2014-11-18 02:07:02	Sik	I did everything except the music (take a guess why the music is the one holding back this :P)
2014-11-18 02:07:08	Beamboom	ah cool!
2014-11-18 02:07:10	tadzik	:)
2014-11-18 02:07:15	Sik	And yeah indie I guess (though I want to avoid that label due to the stigma)
2014-11-18 02:07:25	Sik	(but technically yes it would be indie)
2014-11-18 02:07:55	Sik	I'm releasing source code too
2014-11-18 02:08:02	Sik	Which is rather unusual for a commercial game :v
2014-11-18 02:08:03	Beamboom	Sweet.
2014-11-18 02:08:29	mirv_	Sik, releasing it immediately on release, or waiting a bit first?
2014-11-18 02:08:45	Sik	Immediately, executable is GPL3
2014-11-18 02:09:12	mirv_	I'd be quite interested what kind of feedback you get about that (eventually!)
2014-11-18 02:09:23	Sik	:) Yeah, I'm going against the norm on purpose
2014-11-18 02:10:24	mirv_	it'll help you stand out
2014-11-18 02:11:05	mirv_	righteo, brain charged enough, time to get back to work
2014-11-18 02:11:31	Sik	Between the heavy emphasis in modding (without modification) and that, I assume that can make it much easier to build a community around it (which will help in the long term)
2014-11-18 02:11:44	Sik	Not to mention, GPL3 will probably bring the attention of Linux folks
2014-11-18 02:12:55	Sik	I guess it also shows its Linux origins :P (Linux version is the original, Windows version is the port... and don't get me started on how much I'm hating Windows right now because of stupid design decisions)
2014-11-18 02:15:32	von	gotta reboot mah server =/

2014-11-18 02:22:46	Sik	:P
2014-11-18 02:23:23	 *	Sik whacks jaycee_ with the way the console works (though I think I'm more annoyed that this would not have been an issue with the Win9x command line)
2014-11-18 02:23:39	Tag_	jaycee_: guess what
2014-11-18 02:23:43	Sik	Although I understand that one is a horrible legacy mess dating from 16-bit Windows
2014-11-18 02:23:45	Sik	:S
2014-11-18 02:24:02	Tag_	here, where i'm living right now, there's a retro computing expo next month :)
2014-11-18 02:24:05	jaycee_	Sik, anything specific that affects your game?
2014-11-18 02:24:16	jaycee_	Tag_, hehe, im sure theyll have amigas then ;)
2014-11-18 02:24:28	Sik	jaycee_: yeah, I wanted for the game to not have a console if launched normally, but if running from cmd then to be able to use the console
2014-11-18 02:24:48	Sik	You can't get both at the same time (properly and without ugly hacks, at least)
2014-11-18 02:25:09	Sik	In the end decided to just make it a console application and to get rid of the console as soon as it starts if it isn't its parent's
2014-11-18 02:25:43	jaycee_	oh you mean have a WinMain but still have your console if you want?
2014-11-18 02:26:10	Sik	More like "don't create a console if there isn't one but if there is already then let me use it"
2014-11-18 02:26:26	Sik	(the latter being basically "launched from cmd" for practical purposes)
2014-11-18 02:26:47	Sik	tl;dr only use a parent console, not one's own console
2014-11-18 02:26:59	jaycee_	you should be able to do that, ive seen other things do it
2014-11-18 02:27:14	Sik	There IS a quirk in cmd that lets you cheat (use a .com program that's console-based and an .exe program that's GUI-based)
2014-11-18 02:27:22	Sik	But eh, lazy
2014-11-18 02:27:27	jaycee_	no, theres API to do it
2014-11-18 02:27:39	Sik	AttachConsole? Doesn't work in practice
2014-11-18 02:27:50	Sik	Control returns to cmd before the game closes
2014-11-18 02:28:08	jaycee_	GetConsoleWindow() will tell you if you have a console or not
2014-11-18 02:28:08	Sik	So I can print to it, but cmd is already accepting input too
2014-11-18 02:28:50	Sik	The problem is not that (I can detect it), the problem is that I can't prevent cmd from returning to the prompt immediately without being a console program
2014-11-18 02:28:52	jaycee_	hm yeah if you use winmain it probably sets up for a console. you can just use main() too i think
2014-11-18 02:29:05	Sik	And I can't make a console program that won't at least flash the console when run on its own
2014-11-18 02:29:30	Sik	I decided that the latter was the lesser of both evils in the end
2014-11-18 02:29:49	Sik	It looks ugly, but it works, and I can just say it's part of the initialization for the technically uneducated ;P
2014-11-18 02:29:54	Cheeseness	There's a new Trine update which fixes problems that some people were having
2014-11-18 02:31:04	jaycee_	sik, how i would do it is have a command line switch that, if specified, opens a console
2014-11-18 02:31:22	jaycee_	because tbh, this is not unix.. expecting it to work as unix does is not writing portable code
2014-11-18 02:33:01	Sik	The problem is some command parameters essentially (--help, --version - you probably want the latter to not output to a GUI so other programs can capture the version number)
2014-11-18 02:33:05	jaycee_	you could also look at the CRT code to see what the different behaviour is in main() vs winmain()
2014-11-18 02:35:04	-->	zewm (~zewm@99-159-60-69.lightspeed.miamfl.sbcglobal.net) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-11-18 02:35:23	Sik	When it comes to situations when the game is already opened I probably won't use the console outside a debug build (and a debug build will always be built as a console program anyway)
2014-11-18 02:35:36	Sik	You don't want stuff to get lost in a background window when you're playing fullscreen
2014-11-18 02:36:23	jaycee_	yes i would stick to opening your own console on your debug builds, thats not hard to implement
2014-11-18 02:40:36	jaycee_	hm got a feeling the /SUBSYSTEM option to the linker controls this behaviour actually
2014-11-18 02:42:11	jaycee_	stick to your own console i think. probably best
2014-11-18 02:44:08	Sik	Won't help when it's an "output text and then quit" command
2014-11-18 02:44:41	Sik	The rest are things I would probably render in my own engine instead
2014-11-18 02:45:03	Sik	(all the debug tools output to the framebuffer itself)
2014-11-18 02:45:45	Sik	...should we move this to a query or what? Discussing Windows programming on this channel doesn't make much sense :P
2014-11-18 02:45:59	Sik	(but then again, I'm OK with the solution I found in the end, so I don't care much at this point)
2014-11-18 02:49:50	jaycee_	youre writing a portable engine so thats still "gaming on linux" ;)
2014-11-18 02:54:27	mirv_	a headline of "CoD isn't an FPS, it's something better" made me laugh
2014-11-18 02:54:38	mirv_	I laughed all the way to removing polygon from my rss feed
2014-11-18 02:55:43	tadzik	:D
2014-11-18 02:56:35	mirv_	maybe it's more cinematic than that
2014-11-18 02:56:49	mirv_	and contains more triangles (er...I mean emotion)!
2014-11-18 02:56:56	jaycee_	CoD isnt an fps indeed
2014-11-18 02:57:01	jaycee_	its a dead horse being flogged
2014-11-18 02:57:28	mirv_	I should read the article, but I'm betting I know who wrote it....
2014-11-18 02:58:07	mirv_	oh wow, it's not who I thought
2014-11-18 02:59:08	mirv_	this is why I like Samsai's casts
2014-11-18 02:59:16	mirv_	you get a proper feel of the game
2014-11-18 03:00:35	mirv_	argh, no, stop procrastinating, back to work...
2014-11-18 03:00:54	jaycee_	blimey, ive obviously been playing witcher 1 quite a bit. nearly a gig of saves

2014-11-18 04:51:15	flesk_	No update on Battle Chess for Linux?
2014-11-18 04:51:54	liam_probably	btw linux voice released the first issue for free if u guys didn't see it
2014-11-18 04:51:57	jaycee_	battle chess, seriously ? :)

2014-11-18 04:53:01	@Samsai	the important bits: http://www.linuxvoice.com/issues/001/gamin.pdf
2014-11-18 04:53:16	flesk_	They had to do something to spruce it up a bit.
2014-11-18 04:53:23	jaycee_	flesk_, some of us remember the original Battle Chess :)
2014-11-18 04:53:41	liam_probably	battle chess the original <3
2014-11-18 04:53:41	jaycee_	i see its a remake. the original was released in 1988
2014-11-18 04:53:52	liam_probably	wait, i think i had the original
2014-11-18 04:53:57	liam_probably	i had one on amiga i think
2014-11-18 04:54:02	flesk_	Will probably make its way into real life federation chess eventually too.
2014-11-18 04:54:02	jaycee_	yep
2014-11-18 04:54:09	jaycee_	the amiga version was the first version
2014-11-18 04:54:21	liam_probably	then yes, i owned it
2014-11-18 04:54:26	liam_probably	happy memories with that one
2014-11-18 04:54:50	liam_probably	im tempted to hook up my megadrive to my dads tv today heh
2014-11-18 04:55:14	liam_probably	although i have his chromecast and wireless printer to setup <_<
2014-11-18 04:57:13	jaycee_	This is probably a good title to demonstrate how far ahead the amiga was at the time

2014-11-18 04:57:35	jaycee_	note that the Amiga version was released in 1998, and the DOS version in 1993
2014-11-18 04:57:38	NuSuey	remember that. loved it :)
2014-11-18 04:57:48	Raven67854	And became irrelevant  :(
2014-11-18 04:59:12	Beamboom	Awww amiga... <3
2014-11-18 04:59:20	jaycee_	CGA screenshots are always funny
2014-11-18 04:59:36	Raven67854	There's one really awesome Amiga game that I really loved
2014-11-18 04:59:40	Raven67854	that I can't remember the name to
2014-11-18 04:59:43	Raven67854	and I feel bad because of that
2014-11-18 04:59:45	flesk_	The Patrician?
2014-11-18 04:59:48	liam_probably	what was it like Raven67854 ?
2014-11-18 04:59:51	Raven67854	No
2014-11-18 04:59:55	Raven67854	It was not the patrician

2014-11-18 05:00:24	jaycee_	look through HOL or LemonAmiga and youll probably find it:)

2014-11-18 05:06:19	Raven67854	package a web app to run on desktop?
2014-11-18 05:06:32	gkeen_	yes for multiple people.. like with an installer :P
2014-11-18 05:06:43	Raven67854	I dunno about with an installer. Just zip the damn thing
2014-11-18 05:06:54	Raven67854	But there's a few programs out there that will package it up into a nice exe
2014-11-18 05:08:03	jaycee_	use NSIS
2014-11-18 05:08:20	NuSuey	btw, what browser do you guys use?

2014-11-18 05:10:19	Raven67854	NuSuey, I use Firefox
2014-11-18 05:10:22	Raven67854	Fuck Chrome
2014-11-18 05:10:33	gkeen_	NuSuey: Chromium

2014-11-18 05:11:01	liam_probably	Samsai: can you go over the this war of mine article in the queue and comment with any suggestions?
2014-11-18 05:11:23	@Samsai	liam_probably, sure
2014-11-18 05:11:53	Raven67854	NuSuey, I can max WoW on wine =/
2014-11-18 05:11:58	Raven67854	Can even maintain 90 fps
2014-11-18 05:11:58	FutureSuture	gkeen_, maybe 10 versions ago, but this is no longer the case whatsoever.
2014-11-18 05:12:12	NuSuey	Raven67854: with OpenGL, right?
2014-11-18 05:12:17	Raven67854	NuSuey, no not with opengl
2014-11-18 05:12:24	NuSuey	o.O how the hell
2014-11-18 05:12:26	Raven67854	I do not use WoW's shitty OpenGL render
2014-11-18 05:12:32	liam_probably	Samsai: ty
2014-11-18 05:12:45	NuSuey	Raven67854: tell me your secret
2014-11-18 05:12:54	Raven67854	NuSuey, I don't have a shitty computer
2014-11-18 05:12:58	NuSuey	ha!
2014-11-18 05:13:10	Raven67854	NuSuey, yeah it runs like a turd compared to the windows version
2014-11-18 05:13:30	Raven67854	But since you can't do multisample aa anymore
2014-11-18 05:13:34	Raven67854	FXAA is all you got
2014-11-18 05:13:41	NuSuey	uhm, 90 fps is too low for you?
2014-11-18 05:13:44	Raven67854	Can get decent framerate
2014-11-18 05:13:57	Raven67854	NuSuey, No I'm just speaking comparatively
2014-11-18 05:13:59	gkeen_	FutureSuture: happened to me once a week before i switched a month ago..
2014-11-18 05:14:07	NuSuey	Raven67854: so what fps you get on windows?
2014-11-18 05:14:27	Raven67854	Last time I tried on windows I got around 150-200FPS not in a raid
2014-11-18 05:14:34	Raven67854	The new WoW update really boosted my FPS
2014-11-18 05:14:52	NuSuey	oh! haven't tried WoW in Windows yet
2014-11-18 05:14:54	Raven67854	Also Directx11 vs Directx9 big difference
2014-11-18 05:15:04	gkeen_	Raven67854: i wish they would implement the mac opengl engine in the windows client.
2014-11-18 05:15:23	Raven67854	Directx9 one works fine
2014-11-18 05:15:29	Raven67854	Missing 1 feature but that's okay
2014-11-18 05:15:37	Raven67854	Don't need that ugly ass SSAO anyway
2014-11-18 05:16:00	NuSuey	I'm using OpenGL to get better fps.. don't care if some graphic features aren't in it
2014-11-18 05:16:07	NuSuey	fuck eye candy
2014-11-18 05:16:16	Raven67854	It's an MMO
2014-11-18 05:16:24	jaycee_	why would you want to use the gl renderer on windows?
2014-11-18 05:16:33	gkeen_	jaycee_: more fps ?
2014-11-18 05:16:41	Raven67854	jaycee_, if they implemented the GL render in the windows version. Linux people would benefit
2014-11-18 05:16:42	NuSuey	jaycee_: windows? on linux..
2014-11-18 05:16:52	jaycee_	oh right youre using it under wine..
2014-11-18 05:16:53	Raven67854	It's not for windows users..
2014-11-18 05:17:05	NuSuey	well it's more for linux/mac os users
2014-11-18 05:17:12	Raven67854	I do fine with Directx9 though
2014-11-18 05:17:15	Raven67854	Not a big wow guy
2014-11-18 05:17:24	gkeen_	NuSuey: the mac one is not the same
2014-11-18 05:17:29	Raven67854	but I play it every now and then for a month then don't touch it for a year
2014-11-18 05:17:42	NuSuey	well I got a 750ti .. guess you have a better card Raven67854
2014-11-18 05:17:46	gkeen_	Raven67854: it was possible to run in d3d11 with cedega back in the day..
2014-11-18 05:17:48	Raven67854	NuSuey, yeah
2014-11-18 05:18:02	NuSuey	gkeen_: uhm I think they ditched GLL and using OpenGL ..for mac os.. or am I wrong?
2014-11-18 05:18:05	gkeen_	NuSuey: i dont think its the gfx card limiting there but the cpu :P
2014-11-18 05:18:06	Raven67854	gkeen_, back in the day? That's a term for many many years ago
2014-11-18 05:18:18	@Samsai	liam_probably, can't really think of anything
2014-11-18 05:18:23	liam_probably	sweet
2014-11-18 05:18:27	gkeen_	NuSuey: what would they use instead? Mirectx 1.0? :P
2014-11-18 05:18:36	liam_probably	Samsai: do you own twom?
2014-11-18 05:18:46	NuSuey	gkeen_: well you could use OpenGL and GLL as the glxapi before
2014-11-18 05:18:51	Raven67854	NuSuey, they use GL for Mac OS X. They always have and always will
2014-11-18 05:18:53	NuSuey	dunno what is the default one on mac os now
2014-11-18 05:18:56	@Samsai	liam_probably, nope
2014-11-18 05:19:29	liam_probably	ill see if i can grab you a copy around the end of the month to cast or stream or somethings
2014-11-18 05:19:41	Raven67854	NuSuey, wow's sys requirements went up slightly with new update
2014-11-18 05:19:48	NuSuey	"Mac users default changed to "GLL" from "OpenGL"."
2014-11-18 05:19:48	liam_probably	would be a crime not to video is in some way
2014-11-18 05:20:00	liam_probably	it*
2014-11-18 05:20:01	Raven67854	NuSuey, it's just it's name for it's opengl engine =/.
2014-11-18 05:20:06	Raven67854	It's still OpenGL
2014-11-18 05:20:06	NuSuey	Rewrite of OpenGL, allowing for more graphics card usage, resulting in higher fps.
2014-11-18 05:20:08	NuSuey	i know
2014-11-18 05:20:14	@Samsai	i've heard it's a good game
2014-11-18 05:20:35	Raven67854	Samsai, This war of Mine is great.. Except for no saving(checkpoint saves)... I really hate that
2014-11-18 05:20:39	liam_probably	i'm enjoying it, little bummed i didn't take my laptop with me today to play it tonight
2014-11-18 05:21:28	@Samsai	i'm probably going to drink another mug of hot chocolate and see if i can put together that last federation video
2014-11-18 05:22:56	Raven67854	I would love hot chocolate
2014-11-18 05:23:06	liam_probably	mmm hot choc
2014-11-18 05:23:21	@Samsai	i'd love a cure for common cold, but hot chocolate will have to do
2014-11-18 05:23:21	Raven67854	I lack milk in my fridge and I have no chocolate period =/.
2014-11-18 05:23:22	Raven67854	Such a bummer
2014-11-18 05:23:47	NuSuey	I liked that in the MAC OS version of WoW you could record a movie from within the client .. anyone know if this is still in the game? :)
2014-11-18 05:24:03	Raven67854	NuSuey, probably is
2014-11-18 05:24:21	kkit	i have found that alternative milks (soy, almond) get weird when hot

2014-11-18 06:24:46	BitRic	NuSuey: antergos just won't let me install my nvidia drivers properly
2014-11-18 06:25:00	NuSuey	was easy in manjaro?
2014-11-18 06:25:12	BitRic	it was, it came with bumblebee out of the box
2014-11-18 06:26:06	BitRic	Antergos installed nouveau and the mesa-lib wouldn't let me use my nvidia driver
2014-11-18 06:26:25	BitRic	i tried so many things i found in wikis and forums, but nothing
2014-11-18 06:26:38	BitRic	i installed antergos 19 times(!)
2014-11-18 06:26:46	NuSuey	ouch :X
2014-11-18 06:26:56	NuSuey	-> 3 times .. i think
2014-11-18 06:27:27	BitRic	i would love to use antergos instead of manjaro
2014-11-18 06:27:44	NuSuey	why so.. something bad about manjaro?:)

2014-11-18 06:29:08	BitRic	for me manjaro behaves to arch like mint to ubuntu
2014-11-18 06:29:08	NuSuey	yeah.. this and that they don't have a manjaro with gnome desktop
2014-11-18 06:29:22	NuSuey	hah. yeah exactly
2014-11-18 06:30:16	BitRic	i think i try antergos again with only bash and install drivers by myself
2014-11-18 06:30:20	BitRic	maybe that helps

2014-11-18 06:32:06	NuSuey	that I don't know.. :) but if you are happy with manjaro, why switch
2014-11-18 06:32:20	BitRic	FutureSuture: i find antergos as easy as manjaro, it's just the graphics thingy
2014-11-18 06:32:22	liam_probably	i wish my dad would come to me before he buys stuff, would have never let him get a freaking celeron processor laptop

2014-11-18 06:33:46	FutureSuture	BitRic, I played around with Antergos as well, but Manjaro just remains easier.

2014-11-18 06:34:52	FutureSuture	Installing/Switching/Updating Linux kernels and graphics drivers is too easy in Manjaro, BitRic. All the people hating on Linux for being a completely unfriendly operating system need to try Manjaro.

2014-11-18 06:59:48	xpander69	autolock no idea whats that
2014-11-18 06:59:55	BitRic	damn
2014-11-18 07:00:31	FutureSuture	xpander69, I set KDE to log me in automatically and then lock so that when I put in my password, everything is already loaded.
2014-11-18 07:00:42	FutureSuture	xpander69, rotating desktop background images. <3
2014-11-18 07:00:57	FutureSuture	BitRic, join #manjaro for help if needed.
2014-11-18 07:01:00	xpander69	well thats not really a KDE thing? its the Display Manager afaik
2014-11-18 07:01:04	xpander69	depends what you use
2014-11-18 07:01:22	FutureSuture	xpander69, KDM has that. No other DM I know has it, sadly.
2014-11-18 07:01:28	xpander69	rotating desktop backround images yes with the tools.. i dont like changing my wallpapers all the time though
2014-11-18 07:01:40	xpander69	you can use KDM on other DE's also
2014-11-18 07:02:18	FutureSuture	xpander69, I see. Standard stuff in KDE and Xfce, though. :P What makes you use MATE over Xfce?
2014-11-18 07:02:39	xpander69	but you can achieve the same with random DM autologin and the from powermanager you make it to lock automatically
2014-11-18 07:02:47	xpander69	so you have to unlock it when you come back
2014-11-18 07:03:34	xpander69	for me its the set of available applets that im used to .. + i dont like XFCE's filemanager..ofc i can replace it with another one

2014-11-18 07:05:15	FutureSuture	xpander69, is that possible via the power manager? To lock only upon logging in?
2014-11-18 07:05:48	xpander69	no
2014-11-18 07:05:57	xpander69	lock screen at certain time

2014-11-18 12:47:34	zewm_laptop	von: can you give a synopsis for that link? I'm currently out of X :(
2014-11-18 12:47:43	zewm_laptop	or how can I copy it and open it in lynx?

2014-11-18 12:48:10	zewm_laptop	I got that game on launch day, I would be interested in that article :D
2014-11-18 12:48:21	zewm_laptop	otherwise I'll just read it later when I'm on my desktop
2014-11-18 12:48:42	von	I don't have lynx installed
2014-11-18 12:48:48	von	but elinks opens it fine
2014-11-18 12:48:56	zewm_laptop	elinks is in CLI?
2014-11-18 12:49:01	von	yeah
2014-11-18 12:49:07	zewm_laptop	I'm on my laptop just using irssi
2014-11-18 12:49:16	zewm_laptop	is elink a browser?

2014-11-18 12:49:38	zewm_laptop	is there a way I can copy it from irssi?
2014-11-18 12:49:41	zewm_laptop	I don't have a CLI mouse atm
2014-11-18 12:49:52	zewm_laptop	I have no clue how to set that up
2014-11-18 12:49:57	von	do you by any chance use any terminal multiplexer?
2014-11-18 12:50:02	von	tmux or screen?
2014-11-18 12:50:08	von	I'm fairly sure they can do the trick
2014-11-18 12:50:18	zewm_laptop	hrm.. I mean I can just open another TTY
2014-11-18 12:50:25	zewm_laptop	with alt + F keys
2014-11-18 12:50:40	zewm_laptop	I just don't know how to copy the link from irssi and then paste it into elinks/lynx

2014-11-18 12:50:49	zewm_laptop	OH
2014-11-18 12:50:53	zewm_laptop	I see what you mean

2014-11-18 12:51:12	zewm_laptop	I can google it right?

2014-11-18 12:51:38	von	anyways, 11 Bit studios replied to the torrent of This War of Mine on thepiratebay
2014-11-18 12:51:45	von	and given out 10 copies on steam
2014-11-18 12:51:55	von	said that they understand that there can be many reasons for piracy
2014-11-18 12:52:16	von	some people may be unable to afford the game, or have difficulties paying for it for one reason or another
2014-11-18 12:52:46	von	so they ask people if they can't pay and pirate it to just spread the word about the game

2014-11-18 12:55:20	von	also lynx is so obnoxious =/
2014-11-18 12:55:23	zewm_laptop	lol
2014-11-18 12:55:27	zewm_laptop	yea I just installed elinks
2014-11-18 12:55:27	von	elinks feels much cleaner and better
2014-11-18 12:55:33	zewm_laptop	I just googled the article :D
2014-11-18 12:55:41	zewm_laptop	Yea, I didn't know about elinks, thanks for the heads up
2014-11-18 12:55:48	zewm_laptop	and yea, I had been following this war of mine for a while
2014-11-18 12:55:55	zewm_laptop	and I purchased it the minute it went on sale

2014-11-18 12:56:06	Raven67854	I bought this war of mine on friday

2014-11-18 12:56:14	zewm_laptop	and the developers responded to me on an issue I had
2014-11-18 12:56:19	Raven67854	Nice game though
2014-11-18 12:56:34	zewm_laptop	Raven67854: yea, also the random crash to desktop
2014-11-18 12:56:35	von	in a game like that
2014-11-18 12:56:39	von	checkpoints kinda make sense
2014-11-18 12:56:41	zewm_laptop	but they are working on it
2014-11-18 12:56:49	Raven67854	zewm_laptop, never experienced that thankfully
2014-11-18 12:56:56	zewm_laptop	yeah it's crashed to me after like 2 days
2014-11-18 12:56:58	Raven67854	von, accidently click next day and see how you feel about it
2014-11-18 12:57:05	von	lol
2014-11-18 12:57:05	zewm_laptop	I get to day 2 and it goes to desktop, no errors
2014-11-18 12:57:14	zewm_laptop	I still don't understand the game
2014-11-18 12:57:16	zewm_laptop	I just click things
2014-11-18 12:57:17	zewm_laptop	lol

2014-11-18 12:58:55	zewm_laptop	and they ran great on my rig
2014-11-18 12:59:09	zewm_laptop	it was on the gamingonlinux subreddit (someone posted a link)
2014-11-18 13:00:02	Raven67854	I have the editor working on my system
2014-11-18 13:00:08	Raven67854	Still better to use Windows quite frankly

2014-11-18 13:29:20	Happy-Ferret	By using an asinine filesystem that doesn't do journaling but indexes all day long. This combined with chkdsk (which they still enable by default).
2014-11-18 13:29:27	zewm	I thought meta+enter opened a terminal
2014-11-18 13:29:46	von	err, it's not i3

2014-11-18 13:30:28	Happy-Ferret	The fact that anti-virus software has to be fairly agressive on Windows probably does add some additional wear and tear.

2014-11-18 13:35:12	Happy-Ferret	I don't know any sane *nix auto-executing fsck. The fact that Microsoft's "engineers" thought it was a good idea to do not only that but also only give the user 10 seconds to abort goes to show just what a horrendous bunch of morons those guys are.

2014-11-18 13:39:57	BitRic	i would be so happy if there was a "good" MMORPG it out there
2014-11-18 13:40:53	Happy-Ferret	BitRic, The Elder Scrolls Online, Star Trek Online, DDO and LOTRO are rather decent.
2014-11-18 13:41:10	BitRic	but they don't run natively
2014-11-18 13:42:40	disharmonic	Happy-Ferret: Do you remember how many data loss bugs ext4 had after it was declared stable?
2014-11-18 13:42:57	disharmonic	And yes NTFS is ancient
2014-11-18 13:44:04	Happy-Ferret	BitRic, wine Linux wrapped copies of The Elder Scrolls Online ran better/more stable than the "native" Mac release, last I checked.
2014-11-18 13:44:22	BitRic	but ESO sucks :/
2014-11-18 13:45:11	Happy-Ferret	disharmonic, I do. But, as far as I remember, no one forced you to use it.
2014-11-18 13:45:20	Happy-Ferret	BitRic, LOTRO and DDO should work well too.
2014-11-18 13:45:24	Happy-Ferret	Also, Everquest 2.
2014-11-18 13:46:17	BitRic	Happy-Ferret, LOTRO is not my kind of thing, DDO is meh, EQ2 with that F2P model is just silly. i just want a native one without wine

2014-11-18 14:12:26	Happy-Ferret	Have to say though, I didn't experience that "beep and gone" thingy before installing Adobe Flash and that Youtube Control Center. So perhaps it's one of those.
2014-11-18 14:14:39	Happy-Ferret	I'm also not exactly happy with the documentation work. There really should be a page explaining XUL's/Gecko's rendering hierarchy, making it clear to the dev that not all elements are actually rendered the same way.

2014-11-18 16:01:21	Happy-Ferret	I'm a bit dumbfound. If the only way to receive a GPL3 licensed source is to pay up to 800 bucks, can this still be considered in compliance with the actual licensing terms?
2014-11-18 16:05:44	Dezponia	Happy-Ferret: Yes, provided you dont prevent me from then sharing that code with others once I have it
2014-11-18 16:05:57	Happy-Ferret	Ah. Ok. I see.
2014-11-18 16:06:44	Happy-Ferret	Well. Guess I'll spend some time going through what bit of source is available for free, then decide whether I want to spend any additional money.
2014-11-18 16:08:22	Dezponia	Happy-Ferret: You can sell free software in binary form but if you do you must provide the source if asked for it. Freedom 1. The GPL does not REQUIRE anyone from sharing their code as long as they keep their program private
2014-11-18 16:08:47	Dezponia	But as soon as they release it for others to use they must provide code
2014-11-18 16:09:13	Happy-Ferret	Guess it's GPL compliant then. Every pay to use plugin does include the full source.
2014-11-18 16:09:24	Dezponia	Freedom 2 and 3 ensures your right to then re-distrobute the code, original or modified
2014-11-18 16:09:28	Happy-Ferret	Thanks.
2014-11-18 16:10:03	Dezponia	Happy-Ferret: You may find their code somewhere else already if you look around since no one could stop a person from sharing it once they have it

2014-11-18 16:12:06	Dezponia	Personally I'm a strong believer in the idea that people should donate the same amount they would pay for a propritary equivilant of free software to help ensure its future development. I also think the smart thing to do is to donate as far upstream as possible
2014-11-18 16:12:56	Dezponia	For example I use KDE, regardless of distro. Instead of donating to the distros themself I donate to KDE since improvements to KDE will help the entire ecosystem and any gains from my donation will follow me if I want to switch distro
2014-11-18 16:13:48	Dezponia	Of course that is only true to a certain extent. Distros do a lot of work with maintaince and I help out there as well, but on a wider scale upstream is still preferable :)

2014-11-19 02:28:50	Morgawr	so.. is it confirmed that the new ron gilbert point and click game is going to be on Linux? I see a Linux reference on the right side for kickstarter rewards but it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere else
2014-11-19 02:29:07	Morgawr	I wanted to pledge $50 because I love point and click games but... I want to be sure (I was burned way too much in past pledges)
2014-11-19 02:31:08	Leftmost	Morgawr, that pledge is the sole reference I see to platforms, but it would strongly suggest that yes, it will be on Linux.
2014-11-19 02:31:16	 *	Morgawr fingers crossed
2014-11-19 02:32:25	Leftmost	You could always ask them.
2014-11-19 02:33:01	Morgawr	I might when I get back home from work
2014-11-19 02:33:28	Leftmost	Meh, I'll ask now. :)
2014-11-19 02:33:59	Leftmost	Question sent.
2014-11-19 02:34:27	Morgawr	thanks <3
2014-11-19 02:47:56	flesk__	Morgawr: Besides, Ron Gilbert's own engine already supports Linux, as mentioned in the GOL article.
2014-11-19 02:48:26	flesk__	It would be odd to explicitly mention Linux if they don't plan to support it.
2014-11-19 02:48:43	flesk__	Also notice that they've written Windows instead of "PC". :)
2014-11-19 02:48:50	Morgawr	flesk__: I see, I was not up to date with that, good point
2014-11-19 02:49:22	Morgawr	I've seen a lot of devs say "support PC, Mac and Linux" and then it turns out it uses some weird crap of technology which doesn't really support Linux and they realize it's too hard to do so "meh, nevermind, it will come ~later~.. maybe"
2014-11-19 02:49:27	Leftmost	flesk__, but how will PC users know what they mean‽
2014-11-19 02:49:32	Morgawr	meanwhile I have already parted with my money
2014-11-19 02:50:15	flesk__	Yeah, that's true. Ron Gilbert has made pretty much all of his games with engines he himself has built though, so I think it's a pretty safe bet in this case.
2014-11-19 02:50:21	flesk__	Leftmost. Haha. :P
2014-11-19 02:50:48	Leftmost	A Morgawr and his money are soon parted by Linux games.

2014-11-19 03:12:32	jaycee_	ok so gpu memory size on linux is practically impossible without requiring nvidia/amd's gl extensions, and impossible from just enumerating devices. meh :(

2014-11-19 03:14:31	Leftmost	Time to propose a new kernel flibbitybob.
2014-11-19 03:17:26	jaycee_	i guess the question is where to add it on linux really
2014-11-19 03:17:40	jaycee_	ideally the display manager should be enumerating all graphics cards and have that info
2014-11-19 03:17:55	jaycee_	i would settle for DRM having it somehow
2014-11-19 03:18:30	stqn	display manager?
2014-11-19 03:18:42	jaycee_	yeah exactly - whats that on Linux :)
2014-11-19 03:18:45	stqn	isn’t that the thing that lets people enter their password at boot?
2014-11-19 03:19:00	jaycee_	not in the way i meant
2014-11-19 03:19:03	stqn	:P
2014-11-19 03:19:36	stqn	I never understood why it’s called a display manager and not a login manager
2014-11-19 03:19:53	stqn	it’s useless anyway
2014-11-19 03:20:32	jaycee_	api wise what is needed is a way to enumerate gpu's and monitors connected to them. whether they are in use or not
2014-11-19 03:20:54	jaycee_	windows has it, osx has it, im shocked linux has got along so far without something so basic
2014-11-19 03:21:25	jaycee_	but then i guess its because such stuff is implemented as a private interface between x11 and the kernel driver

2014-11-19 03:34:46	Morgawr	jaycee_: well, the problem is that X11 has a different notion of what a monitor and what a display are.. you can have virtual monitors with virtual resolutions (upscaled and whatnot) with multiple displays (aka hardware interfaces) attached to them

2014-11-19 03:37:01	Morgawr	I found that extremely tricky when porting games (especially wine stuff), and yeah it's a mess
2014-11-19 03:37:34	Morgawr	you can query with xrandr for displays and stuff, to find out resolutions etc etc and, aside from the mess that is xrandr behaving differently if you have AMD or nvidia or intel cards, it's not even the "real" setup you may have
2014-11-19 03:38:30	Morgawr	because it may detect a single big screen/resolution but it's actually split between multiple displays, maybe you have 3 displays (aka 3 hardware screens connected) but only one is active and the other two are turned off, maybe the resolution is stretched, maybe it's cropped and two screens share the same area, etc etc
2014-11-19 03:38:34	Morgawr	it's such a mess

2014-11-19 03:47:37	mirv_	c-dull (c#), .net, and/or wpf really have it in against me today
2014-11-19 03:47:41	mirv_	never had so many bsods before
2014-11-19 03:48:34	jaycee_	actual bsod's ? :P
2014-11-19 03:48:43	mirv_	yep
2014-11-19 03:49:07	jaycee_	if any of those 3 are causing bsod's then something bigger is wrong
2014-11-19 03:49:39	mirv_	I'm apparently that good
2014-11-19 03:50:10	jaycee_	Morgawr, what xorg devs should have done is improved x11 so that seperate "screens" are really monitors and stuff can be moved between them, instead of fudging things into one x11 screen
2014-11-19 03:50:30	jaycee_	mirv_, so um.. find out whats causing the bsod ?
2014-11-19 03:50:32	von	xorg devs should have done a lot of things

2014-11-19 03:50:55	jaycee_	yeah, like said "x11 is shit" and started wayland 10 years ago
2014-11-19 03:51:52	jaycee_	i mean NeXT figured that out in 1988 :)
2014-11-19 03:52:14	Morgawr	jaycee_: the thing is, I can understand why a lot of things X11 devs did make sense, kind of.. the problem is that they are very hard to work with how people use computers nowadays. I really like the flexibility and customizability I get with X11 screens and displays and stuff.. the problem is that nobody really needs them (except a few people) and the tools to work with them are abysmal
2014-11-19 03:53:04	Morgawr	the whole gaming and media industry shaped around Windows and the notion that 1 monitor = 1 display = 1 screen, it is more limited but it's what people assume and expect and in reality it's what you really need so...
2014-11-19 03:53:25	jaycee_	actually Macs started that concept, they had multi monitor before Windows did
2014-11-19 03:53:56	Morgawr	well I don't know much about Macs so yeah, I'll take your word for it :P but we can agree it didn't start on Linux
2014-11-19 03:54:16	mirv_	jaycee_, I'm narrowing down what's causing the bsod, but it takes time
2014-11-19 03:54:22	mirv_	because of all the bloody bsods
2014-11-19 03:55:07	jaycee_	turn kernel dumps on, grab windbg, next bsod look at the dump

2014-11-19 03:55:18	jaycee_	though if its bsoding as soon as you do anything id say theres a hardware issue
2014-11-19 03:56:29	FutureSuture	NuSuey, yes, I use Manjaro. Have been doing so since around summer last year. Went from Mint to openSUSE to Manjaro, haven't looked back. Used Ubuntu in the past as well, before Steam for Linux was released.
2014-11-19 04:01:47	FutureSuture	NuSuey, why do you ask?
2014-11-19 04:04:28	Morgawr	mirv_: time to linux then :)
2014-11-19 04:08:42	mirv_	it's likely some piece of hardware that's triggering a problem in the c#/.net/wpf code
2014-11-19 04:09:09	mirv_	a C++ version has no issues (aside from flaky communication)
2014-11-19 04:09:19	mirv_	Morgawr, I'd like to, but work doesn't see it that way
2014-11-19 04:12:53	jaycee_	if its a bsod, its a system problem
2014-11-19 04:13:12	jaycee_	only kernel and drivers cause bsod
2014-11-19 04:13:19	jaycee_	and faulty hardware

2014-11-19 04:21:57	sigz	this is strange, I had a 900MB patch downloading on steam for a game, but steam allocated 20GB on it's "downloading" folder for it
2014-11-19 04:22:50	sigz	I was like all the game was duplicated in this folder during patch
2014-11-19 04:25:50	Morgawr	yesterday I had something similar, I think
2014-11-19 04:26:04	Morgawr	I bought binding of isaac, installed it and it said I still had 17GB left on my home
2014-11-19 04:26:13	Morgawr	then a few hours later I get a notice "you are running out of space in your home"
2014-11-19 04:26:22	Morgawr	and I notice that wasteland 2 was downloading a 900MB update
2014-11-19 04:26:40	jaycee_	i guess steam on linux doesnt preallocate the storage space
2014-11-19 04:26:47	Morgawr	I did a "df" and saw I only had a couple megabytes free in my home partition, so I deleted some old games
2014-11-19 04:26:57	mirv_	jaycee_, my best guess at the moment is hardware twitching a com port, possibly making it appear/disappear
2014-11-19 04:27:01	jaycee_	hm, does ext4 or whatever have sparse files
2014-11-19 04:27:09	Morgawr	jaycee_: I think so
2014-11-19 04:27:29	mirv_	same hardware is ok via C++, but same packet data is ok over alternate com port (different hardware)
2014-11-19 04:27:46	jaycee_	mirv_, some usb to serial thingummy?
2014-11-19 04:28:21	mirv_	jaycee_, micro-usb mbus to usb master
2014-11-19 04:28:41	jaycee_	sounds like something thatd have a custom driver then
2014-11-19 04:28:47	jaycee_	evidently, a shit one ;)
2014-11-19 04:28:49	mirv_	yep
2014-11-19 04:29:21	jaycee_	oh thats right you do stuff for reading smart meters ?
2014-11-19 04:29:23	mirv_	I think a specially crafted packet can kill it...
2014-11-19 04:29:28	Morgawr	http://jolla.com/tablet have you guys seen this? I'm pretty hyped

2014-11-19 04:29:40	mirv_	I build the meter, so have to make things to read it for testing purposes
2014-11-19 04:30:03	jaycee_	ah :) why did they invent a custom bus for them?
2014-11-19 04:30:17	mirv_	mbus is an industry standard
2014-11-19 04:30:33	jaycee_	i know, i mean, why did the industry do that :)
2014-11-19 04:30:47	mirv_	oh, well primarily it's just historical
2014-11-19 04:30:50	mirv_	the thing is ancient
2014-11-19 04:31:03	mirv_	but can handily power the devices directly
2014-11-19 04:31:06	jaycee_	i mean i wondered, why not just optoisolated rs232 for example
2014-11-19 04:31:24	mirv_	again, historical reasons
2014-11-19 04:31:38	jaycee_	fair enough. im sure you guys would rather it was rs232 as well :)
2014-11-19 04:31:39	mirv_	it was actually a good design for what was around, when it was introduced
2014-11-19 04:32:56	mirv_	rs232 typically needs more connector pins, and isn't as well suited for a bus topology
2014-11-19 04:33:47	jaycee_	3, and yeah, if you want them all on the same line i guess not
2014-11-19 04:34:01	mirv_	there's also "wireless" mbus, which is a horrible standard and needs to die (but it won't)
2014-11-19 04:35:16	mirv_	mbus actually has survived quite well, but for smart metering is has limitations
2014-11-19 04:35:30	mirv_	most people just wrap their own protocol up in an mbus packet now
2014-11-19 04:35:41	jaycee_	ew
2014-11-19 04:36:18	mirv_	except Kamstrup, they have their own protocol (which is actually quite nice)

2014-11-19 08:18:08	liamdawe	god dammit i suck at planetary annihilation
2014-11-19 08:18:13	liamdawe	im just too slow for such a fast paced rts
2014-11-19 08:20:35	 *	BitRic knows the feeling
2014-11-19 08:21:39	BitRic	i can't even play the slow paced rts games
2014-11-19 08:21:53	liamdawe	shame we have nothing like starcraft, bit less to worry about, i can actually win in that
2014-11-19 08:22:16	BitRic	sc2 is way to fast for me
2014-11-19 08:22:27	liamdawe	i can handle sc2 easily
2014-11-19 08:22:29	Morgawr	just play civ :)
2014-11-19 08:22:31	Morgawr	best RTS
2014-11-19 08:22:32	liamdawe	don't need to worry about so much
2014-11-19 08:22:33	BitRic	i'm just to dumb for this whole micro/makro thing
2014-11-19 08:22:37	liamdawe	civ is too slow for me
2014-11-19 08:22:48	liamdawe	BitRic: yeah that's what i fail at
2014-11-19 08:22:55	Morgawr	(the joke was that civ is not an RTS)
2014-11-19 08:23:06	Cheeseness	TBH, I just like playing the story campaign on SC2 and vs AI with a friend
2014-11-19 08:23:08	liamdawe	<_< shh you
2014-11-19 08:23:17	liamdawe	that was for Morgawr not Cheeseness btw
2014-11-19 08:23:24	Cheeseness	<3
2014-11-19 08:23:24	liamdawe	i loved the sc2 story
2014-11-19 08:23:39	Cheeseness	I've never lost an online match, but I dunno... competitive just isn't much fun for me
2014-11-19 08:23:44	liamdawe	was still a dual booter when it came out, was fantastic
2014-11-19 08:23:50	liamdawe	really miss sc2
2014-11-19 08:23:56	Cheeseness	I recompiled Wine to make it run when it came out
2014-11-19 08:24:09	liamdawe	it refused to launch for me last i tried
2014-11-19 08:24:21	liamdawe	maybe i should try again now im only on one monitor
2014-11-19 08:24:26	Cheeseness	Hmm... I've got some time. I should probably set it downloading again
2014-11-19 08:25:41	Cheeseness	If it works, we should play sometime
2014-11-19 08:25:47	Cheeseness	(if Blizzard lets us ;_; )
2014-11-19 08:25:54	liamdawe	hah
2014-11-19 08:25:58	liamdawe	yeah sure
2014-11-19 08:26:39	liamdawe	having wine installed might help...
2014-11-19 08:28:09	Cheeseness	heh
2014-11-19 08:30:28	Cheeseness	Ah, nice. Download a stack of updates to know that you need to download a new launcher
2014-11-19 08:30:55	Cheeseness	250MB? How do people make these launcher clients so freaking big?
2014-11-19 08:31:03	liamdawe	so full of love
2014-11-19 08:31:06	liamdawe	and stuff
2014-11-19 08:31:45	BitRic	battle.net launcher stays black for me :/
2014-11-19 08:31:50	jaycee_	lazy bollocks with full bitmapped bits, per language, most likely
2014-11-19 08:31:59	jaycee_	i cut a fuckload of old crap out of the witcher2 launcher
2014-11-19 08:32:27	jaycee_	actually, i wrote that from scratch - the original was a load of bloaty .net nonsense
2014-11-19 08:33:13	jaycee_	to be fair they used to have some registration thing in it which is long obsolete, so now its just "launch game", "launch options editor", "open readme file" and "go to website". not exactly complex :)
2014-11-19 08:34:30	BitRic	ah ok
2014-11-19 08:34:39	BitRic	it was my whole intel gpu vs nvidia gpu again
2014-11-19 08:34:44	BitRic	primusrun did the trick
2014-11-19 08:34:50	liamdawe	the new bnet launcher works great for me
2014-11-19 08:34:56	liamdawe	downloading sc2 now with it
2014-11-19 08:36:51	@Samsai	but isn't sc2 technically just as fast as PA?
2014-11-19 08:37:09	von	jaycee_, why not ditch the launcher completely and go for options launch game / launch settings in steam?
2014-11-19 08:37:22	liamdawe	Samsai: well it's not the speed really, it's the amount you need to manage
2014-11-19 08:37:25	jaycee_	von, because we were asked to provide the launcher
2014-11-19 08:37:45	@Samsai	liamdawe, that i can agree on
2014-11-19 08:37:50	liamdawe	Samsai: i might know enough pa-foo to beat you now though
2014-11-19 08:37:52	von	anyways, time to go home :3
2014-11-19 08:38:00	@Samsai	liamdawe, possibly
2014-11-19 08:38:16	@Samsai	i haven't played since our match, so i haven't improved one single bit
2014-11-19 08:38:28	@Samsai	i do know how to create interplanetary federations though

2014-11-19 09:58:37	FutureSuture	There are so many amazing anime that do not take hundreds of episodes to get to the point.

2014-11-19 10:07:12	FutureSuture	I have noticed that a few anime do that. Completely unlikeable hero, maybe a bit of a coward, loudmouth, whatever, and we grow to like him. We grow with him.
2014-11-19 10:07:20	FutureSuture	Mirai Nikki is an example of this. ^^
2014-11-19 10:07:26	Raven67854	most anime are based on manga :p

2014-11-19 14:47:51	von	I can come up with a few other ways to do it quickly :) But I have to learn perl
2014-11-19 14:48:14	sobkas	it's in perl
2014-11-19 14:48:18	Lightkey	hehe
2014-11-19 14:48:54	von	sobkas, yeah, if you put it in system(); everything is in perl lol

2014-11-19 14:53:13	sobkas	somehow it ended in my /usr/bin, I must installed it, but when?
2014-11-19 14:53:25	von	    You are chdir()'d to $File::Find::dir when the function is called, unless
2014-11-19 14:53:28	von	    "no_chdir" was specified.

2014-11-19 15:38:12	tadzik	I mean, it'll probably always work in this case, but it's a bit like using a global
2014-11-19 15:38:23	tadzik	better to pass it explicitely

2014-11-20 01:47:08	mirv_	morning
2014-11-20 01:47:22	mirv_	basically an open source alternative to bittorrent sync
2014-11-20 01:48:35	NuSuey	well don't have that.. but I need an app that would sync a directory with images constantly and upload it somewhere where I can use it.. would that be something like that?
2014-11-20 01:49:01	mirv_	I use it for local synch between devices
2014-11-20 01:49:50	mirv_	was just curious if anyone had impressions for syncthing, seeing as btsync will probably go for paid features next year

2014-11-20 02:00:00	von	mirv_, I've tried it, have an instance running, but barely use it
2014-11-20 02:00:22	Cheeseness	NuSuey: How constantly is constantly?
2014-11-20 02:00:34	Cheeseness	You could set up rsync with a cron job
2014-11-20 02:01:20	von	a friend of mine that's banned here has been using it for a while and prefers it over Dropbox and ownCloud because it does not corrupt his savegames that can be overwritten pretty heavily during game sessions (I think it was about Terraria)
2014-11-20 02:01:31	von	*who's
2014-11-20 02:02:30	NuSuey	Cheeseness: well.. every 15 minutes at least (or less) yeah, thought about doing it with cron and the grieve (or whatever was it called) but grieve suddenly stopped working one day
2014-11-20 02:02:41	mirv_	von, any real problems with it? doubt I'll be using it that often really
2014-11-20 02:02:59	NuSuey	and I thought if there isn't an easier method.. maybe some app what would do the trick
2014-11-20 02:03:12	Cheeseness	NuSuey: No idea what Grieve is, but rsync is what most people I know use for transferring stuff around
2014-11-20 02:03:30	Cheeseness	It'll be in your repos if it's not already installed
2014-11-20 02:03:37	NuSuey	Cheeseness: well where can it sync? I
2014-11-20 02:04:03	von	mirv_, he has nothing to complain about so far
2014-11-20 02:06:11	NuSuey	Cheeseness: oh okay, it can upload it to google drive.. okay.. if grieve won't help my anymore, I'll try out rsync
2014-11-20 02:06:32	Cheeseness	Cool cool
2014-11-20 02:08:44	mirv_	von, cool, I'll give it a go then

2014-11-20 02:28:36	stqn	well no, I had made ~/steam manually, then did all the stuff inside it, so that created another steam dir inside when I unpacked the first archive

2014-11-20 02:46:20	jaycee_	not for the whole installation

2014-11-20 02:49:15	von	yeah, it's entirely possible

2014-11-20 03:25:22	flesk__	liamdawe: Did that happen recently?
2014-11-20 03:25:27	Leftmost	Fairly recently, yes.
2014-11-20 03:25:39	Leftmost	A couple weeks ago, I think.
2014-11-20 03:25:39	flesk__	I don't remember hearing about that when I started using Netflix.
2014-11-20 03:25:46	flesk__	Oh, ok. Nice. :)

2014-11-20 03:25:54	liamdawe	<3
2014-11-20 03:26:20	Leftmost	flesk__, are the 7dfps games downloadable for use with regular Unity?
2014-11-20 03:26:52	flesk__	Leftmost: Those that are sorted under the Linux tab are.
2014-11-20 03:27:16	flesk__	I think 4/5 games I tried yesterday used Unity.
2014-11-20 03:27:28	flesk__	The last one probably used the developer's own engine.
2014-11-20 03:28:06	flesk__	The one made by David Pittman.
2014-11-20 03:28:08	Leftmost	I'm confused, then, what you mean by "tagged as Linux games by mistake".
2014-11-20 03:28:22	flesk__	Leftmost: I mean those that use the web player.
2014-11-20 03:28:38	flesk__	That aren't available as downloads.
2014-11-20 03:28:44	flesk__	At least not that I could tell.

2014-11-20 03:34:34	liamdawe	it's slowly building up though
2014-11-20 03:34:57	liamdawe	a good few sales on this war of mine, and some CKII expansions

2014-11-20 03:55:24	jaycee_	smells of them checking nvidia/ati to apply nvidia/ati specific workarounds, which is dumb
2014-11-20 03:56:11	Half-Shot	Personally, if your trying to apply workarounds then you need to rethink what you are doing entirely when its drivers involved.

2014-11-20 04:01:30	flesk__	Half-Shot: Yeah, that's like looking at a user agent string to determine browser features instead of actually checking for browser features. It's a really stupid thing that's survived in web development for far too long.
2014-11-20 04:01:57	jaycee_	Half-Shot, id imagine if its crunch time and you want to make release thats what you have to do
2014-11-20 04:02:12	flesk__	Probably not exactly the same, but the same applied (lack of) logic.
2014-11-20 04:02:31	mirv_	sometimes you just have to take shortcuts
2014-11-20 04:02:40	Half-Shot	True, there is a whole debate around that though jaycee_ . Really hate developers being pushed by those deadlines

2014-11-20 04:03:40	Half-Shot	Well, the AAA games industry anyway.
2014-11-20 04:03:41	Morgawr	like those old games that say "your resolution is not supported" because they weren't planned for such big widescreen "future" resolutions
2014-11-20 04:03:51	Morgawr	even though I am forcing a smaller resolution in a wine virtual desktop

2014-11-20 04:04:01	Leftmost	Half-Shot, it's part of the culture for now, unfortunately.
2014-11-20 04:04:02	Morgawr	they still won't go because they detect a bigger one
2014-11-20 04:04:35	Half-Shot	The absolute trash of games are ones that write config files in binary format
2014-11-20 04:04:46	Half-Shot	So you can't even force settings
2014-11-20 04:05:03	Morgawr	just reverse engineer them ;)
2014-11-20 04:05:20	Half-Shot	I think that is what some game secretly gamble on Morgawr
2014-11-20 04:05:30	Half-Shot	Hoping somebody will mod it for them
2014-11-20 04:05:36	mirv_	binary formats allow for much faster, and somewhat easier, config loading
2014-11-20 04:05:37	 *	Half-Shot is slightly cynical.
2014-11-20 04:05:55	Half-Shot	It's a config file. I would take a nice ini file over speed any day.

2014-11-20 09:52:23	Raven67854	I won't fault him for that :p
2014-11-20 09:52:34	jaycee_	yeah i suppose
2014-11-20 09:52:42	jaycee_	its some fair turd polishing
2014-11-20 09:52:48	Raven67854	Indeed
2014-11-20 09:52:54	Raven67854	I like using jack
2014-11-20 09:53:02	Raven67854	But I don't have a decent headset that uses Jack
2014-11-20 09:53:17	jaycee_	isnt jack just shit on top of alsa too ?
2014-11-20 09:53:22	Raven67854	Jack is awesome
2014-11-20 09:53:24	Raven67854	And no
2014-11-20 09:53:27	Raven67854	I don't think so
2014-11-20 09:53:31	Raven67854	Jack is very low latency as well
2014-11-20 09:53:52	Raven67854	Most people who use jack are people who use FLStudio/Bitwig on Linux
2014-11-20 09:54:03	jaycee_	according to wiki, jack is on top of ALSA or OSS typically
2014-11-20 09:54:15	Raven67854	Should try using Jack if you have a way of using it
2014-11-20 09:54:18	Raven67854	It's very nice
2014-11-20 09:54:41	jaycee_	jack doesnt really target what we do with audio
2014-11-20 09:54:46	Raven67854	I'm aware
2014-11-20 09:54:51	stqn	jaycee_: « if systemd has design issues, work on them » is like saying (terrible analogy coming…) « the death camps have design issues, let’s work on them »
2014-11-20 09:54:55	Raven67854	But you can still use Jack anyway :P
2014-11-20 09:55:08	jaycee_	stqn, if systemd has no values - why do major distro's want to use it ?
2014-11-20 09:55:23	Raven67854	stqn, yeah but you can stretch something like that for anything. that tends to be a very cherry picked argument
2014-11-20 09:55:40	jaycee_	what feature set does systemd have that those distro vendors want?
2014-11-20 09:56:30	stqn	Raven67854: well I’ll have to try again I guess, but last time I tried I couldn’t enable the nice graphical effects in WoW be it with directx or opengl.
2014-11-20 09:56:30	jaycee_	all ive seen so far is "theres nothing wrong with sysv init, systemd is lame, waa waa waa". really. if theres nothing wrong with how it is now, why do distro vendors want to change?
2014-11-20 09:56:50	Raven67854	stqn, You can! I do =)
2014-11-20 09:56:53	stqn	jaycee_: I don’t know.
2014-11-20 09:57:09	Raven67854	jaycee_, I do understand some of the criticism of SystemD
2014-11-20 09:57:24	Raven67854	But on the whole it adds some nice things. Most people just don't want to be locked into SystemD
2014-11-20 09:57:31	jaycee_	well it seems like to me systemd bashing is just a huge bunch of zealots who are offended because someone has dared to say "part of the linux ecosystem sucks"
2014-11-20 09:57:32	stqn	Samsai: yes I tried slackware but I can’t install it without a qwerty keyboard
2014-11-20 09:57:48	jaycee_	Raven67854, but youre just as "locked in" to sysv now
2014-11-20 09:58:10	stqn	jaycee_: you’re wronge
2014-11-20 09:58:11	stqn	-e
2014-11-20 09:58:19	Raven67854	what stqn said :p
2014-11-20 09:58:26	jaycee_	am i ? whats the alternative to sysv then thats being used ?
2014-11-20 09:58:46	@Samsai	one thing i don't understand about this sysvinit vs systemd thing is that apparently some user-level software depends on either of them
2014-11-20 09:59:00	@Samsai	i mean, why does a DE for example depend on a certain init system?
2014-11-20 10:00:59	jaycee_	because your desktop needs things like udev to be working
2014-11-20 10:01:23	jaycee_	pity apple didnt have launchd under apache license at first, that mightve been adopted
2014-11-20 10:01:40	Raven67854	Meh
2014-11-20 10:02:03	Raven67854	Having a Mac Book Pro of my own now
2014-11-20 10:02:08	Raven67854	I can honestly say I want nothing to do with Apple
2014-11-20 10:02:19	Raven67854	I fucking hate Yosemite
2014-11-20 10:04:23	stqn	Samsai: some DEs (gnome 3) depend on systemd, but never on another init system AFAIK. And why? Good question. Because Red Hat decided to pay people to make one huge project to take other linux and control everything.
2014-11-20 10:04:31	stqn	 /rant
2014-11-20 10:05:03	jaycee_	or it could be that having to support a million api's that do the same thing is a fucking pain
2014-11-20 10:05:07	@Samsai	stqn, that's lovely
2014-11-20 10:05:49	Raven67854	We're blaming redhat for systemd now
2014-11-20 10:05:51	@Samsai	i still think init services should have nothing to do with user-level applications
2014-11-20 10:06:32	Coolg33k	lennaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart
2014-11-20 10:07:15	@Samsai	but now that we are making user-level software depend on certain init services, i'm going to announce that castawesome will in future only work on sysvinit systems
2014-11-20 10:07:45	Raven67854	Samsai, DE's are more low level than castawesome so you're just being silly now
2014-11-20 10:08:03	@Samsai	Raven67854, it's my software, so shush
2014-11-20 10:08:16	Raven67854	Whatever you wanna do
2014-11-20 10:08:20	@Samsai	i'm also going to make it more tablet friendly
2014-11-20 10:09:19	Raven67854	That would be nice
2014-11-20 10:09:23	Raven67854	So when I use Ubuntu on my tablet
2014-11-20 10:09:29	Raven67854	I can have an easier time clicking buttons
2014-11-20 10:11:03	Coolg33k	Samsai: if you detect systemd on the systemd it will panick the kernel ? :p
2014-11-20 10:11:24	@Samsai	Coolg33k, now that would be an awesome feature to have
2014-11-20 10:11:55	@Samsai	maybe i should ask linus to implement a way for a user-level process to cause a kernel panic?
2014-11-20 10:12:10	Coolg33k	you can ask :>
2014-11-20 10:12:55	jaycee_	lack of sensible integration is precisley linux's overall problem for desktop use

2014-11-20 13:35:33	liamdawe	used memory doesn't always mean wasted, generally unused ram is wasted ram, isn't it?
2014-11-20 13:35:47	xpander69	on linux world most is cached
2014-11-20 13:35:51	xpander69	but he said free -m
2014-11-20 13:36:02	xpander69	there it shows all
2014-11-20 13:36:09	liamdawe	i see
2014-11-20 13:37:17	Happy-Ferret	I tuned down page caching too.
2014-11-20 13:39:12	Happy-Ferret	No sense in that. IMHO, it would only make sense if my use of resources was completely linear.
2014-11-20 13:39:40	xpander69	mine is :D
2014-11-20 13:39:59	xpander69	16GB is nothing for me fills up fast
2014-11-20 13:40:54	Happy-Ferret	Next I'm looking into direct I/O. Should tremendously speed up copy operations of bigger files.
2014-11-20 13:40:57	xpander69	the problem is that im tabaholic :D ..i like my browser with 50+ tabs opened all the time.. and when its up several days then its caching a lot..fast access... but ram fills a lot:D
2014-11-20 13:42:30	Happy-Ferret	Hm. Wouldn't it make sense to tune the caching down then? Why not just grant the resources in a more direction fashion?
2014-11-20 13:42:56	xpander69	naah i got 24GB
2014-11-20 13:42:58	xpander69	so no problems there

2014-11-20 13:45:28	Happy-Ferret	My mom's secondary laptop is a small Toshiba netbook with just 1.5GB RAM (of which up to 768MB are claimed by the "GPU"). The patchset could do wonders for this little device.
2014-11-20 13:47:46	sobkas	liamdawe: yep, I use tmpfs to boost speed of packgage building
2014-11-20 13:48:19	sobkas	liamdawe: also native d3dadapter does wonders for me
2014-11-20 13:48:28	mirv_	tmpfs helps reduce ssd writes too, if you've plenty of ram
2014-11-20 13:48:30	Happy-Ferret	I don't get this whole "unused RAM is wasted RAM" talk, btw. In theory, it's better to have unused RAM. Used or cached RAM has to be reclaimed first, adding additional latency.
2014-11-20 13:49:17	mirv_	Happy-Ferret, that latency is probably hidden by waiting for hard drive access times
2014-11-20 13:49:54	--	sobkas is now known as sobkas[away]
2014-11-20 13:50:19	mirv_	so caching as much as possible in ram is good
2014-11-20 13:50:33	stqn	IF you’re accessing the same files again and again, then it’s better if they are in ram, obviously… But that’s not typical for desktop usage I suppose.
2014-11-20 13:50:51	mirv_	depends on the files

2014-11-21 04:37:18	@liamdawe	trying out this gold rush adventure game
2014-11-21 04:37:24	@liamdawe	and...i can't seem to talk to anyone
2014-11-21 04:38:38	FutureSuture	liamdawe, that's okay
2014-11-21 04:38:51	FutureSuture	You could work on putting that edit button into article in the mean time
2014-11-21 04:38:51	FutureSuture	:D
2014-11-21 04:39:58	@liamdawe	nah i haven't made you wait long enough FutureSuture
2014-11-21 04:43:31	zewm	Has anyone checked out this 'Celestial Command' game yet? How similar is it to Kerbal?
2014-11-21 04:45:44	@liamdawe	from what i saw zewm it's quite different
2014-11-21 04:45:49	FutureSuture	*into articles in
2014-11-21 04:46:44	@liamdawe	FutureSuture: nah u had it right, i only put it in one, and you have to guess :P
2014-11-21 04:49:38	zewm	liamdawe: I have a buddy that plays a lot of Kerbal. Do you think he would enjoy this game in a similar vein? I was debating gifting it
2014-11-21 04:50:09	@liamdawe	it's different, so can't say
2014-11-21 04:50:17	@liamdawe	it has elements of strategy, it's 2d
2014-11-21 04:50:24	@liamdawe	you attack enemy too with fleets
2014-11-21 04:50:28	zewm	ah
2014-11-21 04:50:36	@liamdawe	it's more of a strategy/sandbox, than a flight sandbox like kerbal
2014-11-21 04:50:38	zewm	I saw the video where it was buidling the ship
2014-11-21 04:50:45	zewm	so I thought it was similar to Kerbal in that respect
2014-11-21 04:50:52	zewm	gotcha
2014-11-21 04:51:04	zewm	Yea, I think he plays Kerbal because of the flight sim aspects
2014-11-21 04:51:11	FutureSuture	liamdawe, you cheeky ... person
2014-11-21 04:51:50	FutureSuture	Soul Axiom...no idea what it's about, even after watching the trailer and reading the description.
2014-11-21 04:52:10	zewm	Looks like an FPS
2014-11-21 04:52:30	zewm	but more like Heretic, Hexen, Skyrim style FPS
2014-11-21 04:52:35	zewm	not fast paced like quake or cs

2014-11-21 04:58:33	@liamdawe	oh my
2014-11-21 04:59:51	flesk__	Soul Axiom looks more like a 3D exploration game to me.

2014-11-21 05:00:51	@liamdawe	FutureSuture: sorted the edit issue
2014-11-21 05:01:42	Leftmost	I do believe it's a king penguin, but that same picture also turns up as the result for emperor penguin.
2014-11-21 05:02:16	stqn	"even without the wink it's pretty obvious it's a joke" -> perhaps he didn’t put a smiley and you think he was serious, but he wasn’t … :P

2014-11-21 05:03:25	NuSuey	saw that :)
2014-11-21 05:03:37	flesk__	That submitted editorial could perhaps do with a link to the relevant Steam discussion if you're considering publishing it?

2014-11-21 05:04:33	Leftmost	Larabel saying something makes me less inclined to believe it than I was previously.
2014-11-21 05:04:38	flesk__	stqn: Good theory. Maybe they're porting Uplay to Linux.
2014-11-21 05:05:13	Leftmost	Developer says "We're porting our game to Linux!" Yay, I believe them! Larabel posts a link to their announcement, I get suspicious.
2014-11-21 05:08:38	@liamdawe	lol larabel actually put up three tweets with pictures of a batman game tagged as "#Linux"
2014-11-21 05:08:49	@liamdawe	like two and a half years ago
2014-11-21 05:08:58	@liamdawe	i completely forgot about those, such hype, much crap
2014-11-21 05:09:24	@Samsai	oh, just wait
2014-11-21 05:09:46	@Samsai	when has larabel been wrong about something, let's be honest here
2014-11-21 05:09:46	Leftmost	Six years down the road, someone will port them and he'll post about how he was right the whole time and no one believed him.
2014-11-21 05:10:04	stqn	:)
2014-11-21 05:10:18	Leftmost	Samsai, constantly.
2014-11-21 05:10:23	@liamdawe	i fully expect him to self-reference his tweets to say "i told you batman was coming 5 years ago, see i know shit"
2014-11-21 05:10:53	Leftmost	He was wrong about Steam. The fact that two years later circumstances changed and Steam _did_ come to Linux doesn't mean he was right in the first place.
2014-11-21 05:10:56	@liamdawe	at least if i hype anything, i bloody well follow it up

2014-11-21 05:12:38	@liamdawe	flesk__: what steam discussion btw? about the editorial
2014-11-21 05:12:47	Leftmost	liamdawe, it probably helps to use things like "sources" and "information".
2014-11-21 05:14:12	@liamdawe	Leftmost: of which he never gives
2014-11-21 05:14:36	@liamdawe	i tried looking backat his aspyr posts, to find the quote he stole from gol, but he appears to have stealth remove it
2014-11-21 05:14:45	Leftmost	Right. Sorry if I was unclear: my intention was to imply that you back things up because you have sources, whereas he just has a load of crap.
2014-11-21 05:15:21	@liamdawe	ah yes, well, same reply :D

2014-11-21 05:26:13	Beamboom	liamdawe, have you been made aware that clickingon "like" on comments don't work if one browse the site without the "www." first?
2014-11-21 05:26:42	@liamdawe	browsing without www. is supposed to redirect to www. anyway Beamboom
2014-11-21 05:27:03	@liamdawe	so how are you doing it Beamboom? magic
2014-11-21 05:27:16	Beamboom	Well, that was going to be the suggested action. It doesn't today.
2014-11-21 05:27:34	jaycee_	apache rewrite rule ;)
2014-11-21 05:27:42	Beamboom	yup, should be.
2014-11-21 05:27:47	stqn	liamdawe: it doesn’t redirect
2014-11-21 05:27:58	Beamboom	an url rewrite rule
2014-11-21 05:28:41	@liamdawe	hmmm ur right it doesn't
2014-11-21 05:29:04	jaycee_	i am of course assuming you host with apache :)
2014-11-21 05:29:04	Beamboom	both stqn and I had our bookmarks as "gamingonlinux.com" and have been unable to click on "like"
2014-11-21 05:29:24	Beamboom	I just didn't look into it until today

2014-11-21 05:31:17	stqn	Beamboom: not sure how I ended up on gamingonlinux.com without the www actually, it’s what appears in the URL bar of Firefox when I type “gam” in it…

2014-11-21 05:33:47	FutureSuture	I am not really interested in Total War: Rome II, but it would help gaming on Linux. Sadly, there has been no news for a year.
2014-11-21 05:34:23	Raven67854	Would it really help though? :P
2014-11-21 05:34:49	Raven67854	I mean TW:RII is pretty broken even after a massive set of patches and free content updates
2014-11-21 05:35:45	Leftmost	Raven67854, ever had Wathen's?
2014-11-21 05:36:01	Raven67854	Leftmost, yes
2014-11-21 05:36:05	Leftmost	Thoughts?
2014-11-21 05:36:09	Raven67854	I like it
2014-11-21 05:36:22	Raven67854	I still like woodford more but Wathens is nice
2014-11-21 05:37:58	Raven67854	Leftmost, What do you think of Wathens?
2014-11-21 05:38:15	@liamdawe	hmm
2014-11-21 05:38:22	@liamdawe	it seems my www. rewrite rule vanished
2014-11-21 05:42:00	Leftmost	It's pretty good. I had looked at Woodford, but Wathen's was a bit cheaper and seemed to be well-regarded.
2014-11-21 05:43:27	Raven67854	Leftmost, They're both really good :)
2014-11-21 05:43:33	Raven67854	Can't go wrong with either one honestly haha :D
2014-11-21 05:45:56	@liamdawe	okay the www. redirection is up again
2014-11-21 05:46:07	@liamdawe	i'm thinking i overwrote our htaccess with an old one at somepoint
2014-11-21 05:48:33	stqn	liamdawe: works!
2014-11-21 05:49:16	@liamdawe	ah yeah i must have removed it when working on my local apache, to stop it redirecting...and then forgot to replace it for the live site
2014-11-21 05:49:24	@liamdawe	just call me mr professional
2014-11-21 05:50:37	@liamdawe	still not sure why likes suddenly wipe the number though, they actually don't the likes are there when you refresh
2014-11-21 05:51:27	@Samsai	liamdawe, interested in some interstellar marines?
2014-11-21 05:52:06	@liamdawe	possibly later

2014-11-21 06:13:26	FutureSuture	Origins was made by another developer and suffered severely from that going by my research
2014-11-21 06:13:37	FutureSuture	Asylum and City is what I want
2014-11-21 06:14:02	Raven67854	Have you ever actually played it though?
2014-11-21 06:14:12	DerRidda	It played exactly like the first two games and was fun, bugs are its only problem.

2014-11-21 06:59:44	ImperialXT	maybe with overwatch they will
2014-11-21 06:59:45	tewdin	Yes, but none of their big games support Linux. Mac yes, but no Linux.
2014-11-21 06:59:54	ImperialXT	as it's a completely new franchise
2014-11-21 07:00:39	ImperialXT	which looks amazeballs

2014-11-21 07:02:08	Raven67854	So it'll just be GL4.5
2014-11-21 07:03:58	jaycee_	windows 10 will have opengl, but likely the current extension hell situation still applies, and will require the driver to deliver an opengl icd

2014-11-21 07:04:36	jaycee_	that would be my biggest beef about opengl on windows, they still only export like opengl 2.1 functions, and the rest you have to glGetProcAddress (or use GLEW) to get them
2014-11-21 07:05:06	jaycee_	not really a big deal though with GLEW, and you should use that anyway if youre cross platform :)
2014-11-21 07:06:41	Raven67854	Always with the glew
2014-11-21 07:06:48	Raven67854	I dunno anybody who doesn't use glew honestly jaycee_
2014-11-21 07:07:20	jaycee_	we didnt initially but it's not really that necessary on os x. but it was useful on linux, so now we do
2014-11-21 07:07:38	Raven67854	If you ever plan to be multiplatform. Then yeah you have to use it
2014-11-21 07:07:55	Raven67854	I could not use it on Linux but then going to Mac/Windows would be an utter nightmare
2014-11-21 07:08:33	jaycee_	most of what we were using was already exported as functions on os x
2014-11-21 07:08:44	jaycee_	but our linux side stuff now uses plenty of things that osx doesnt have
2014-11-21 07:09:04	Raven67854	jaycee_, have you tried swift?
2014-11-21 07:09:26	jaycee_	nope, not really my thing, and i must confess i fail to see what apple are trying to do with it
2014-11-21 07:09:36	Raven67854	jaycee_, I dunno either

2014-11-21 07:10:30	jaycee_	id have preferred they do more to bring objc to other platforms
2014-11-21 07:10:33	Raven67854	jaycee_, I think it's supposed to be for easier iOS/Mac Store development for games/apps???
2014-11-21 07:10:43	jaycee_	Raven67854, possibly
2014-11-21 07:10:48	Raven67854	jaycee_, Well only other platform that can do objc is Linux
2014-11-21 07:11:01	jaycee_	nah, windows can as well, its how itunes and safari are ported to it
2014-11-21 07:11:09	Segata_Sanshiro	flesk___  I don't know if you saw but Daedalic added Linux depots for Whispered World according to SteamDB, so sems like that might be next
2014-11-21 07:11:19	Raven67854	jaycee_, I mean actual development. Not end user apps
2014-11-21 07:11:29	jaycee_	you can supposedly get clang under mingw
2014-11-21 07:12:06	Raven67854	I'm a little sad that Apples suggest at the 2012 C++ conference got shut down
2014-11-21 07:12:15	Raven67854	I was like oh wow Apple actually had a good suggestion for C++
2014-11-21 07:12:17	jaycee_	i expect you could develop using clang under windows just fine tbh
2014-11-21 07:12:19	Raven67854	It got killed with intense fire
2014-11-21 07:12:50	Raven67854	Yes but on Linux there's very little work involved. Just install the packages and get to work
2014-11-21 07:12:57	Raven67854	On Windows it'd probably be a mess
2014-11-21 07:13:18	jaycee_	the only time i ever use gcc on windows is for Atmel AVR work
2014-11-21 07:13:34	Raven67854	jaycee_, clang is just as annoying to setup yeah.
2014-11-21 07:14:01	jaycee_	pity as clang is awesome really
2014-11-21 07:14:11	jaycee_	the llvm stuff is fab when integrated into an IDE
2014-11-21 07:14:14	Raven67854	Mac/Linux easiest places for it
2014-11-21 07:14:19	jaycee_	thats pretty much the only thing i like about xcode :)
2014-11-21 07:14:27	Raven67854	I use clang for dev builds
2014-11-21 07:14:36	Raven67854	Very fast compiling
2014-11-21 07:14:38	Raven67854	gcc for final builds
2014-11-21 07:15:14	jaycee_	is gcc still significantly faster performance wise?
2014-11-21 07:15:21	Raven67854	For now
2014-11-21 07:15:31	Raven67854	I dunno what's going to happen
2014-11-21 07:15:34	jaycee_	every time i look at clang vs gcc discussions i get a strong whiff of gcc bias so i dont take much note of them
2014-11-21 07:15:44	Raven67854	clang is under a good license so I don't care which ends up on top
2014-11-21 07:15:54	Raven67854	Whichever is faster is all that matters at the end of the day :p
2014-11-21 07:16:20	jaycee_	i would prefer clang as i object to gpl.. but not only that, have you ever looked at how awful gcc's code is ? :)
2014-11-21 07:16:32	jaycee_	architecturally its a nightmare. its just a well polished turd
2014-11-21 07:16:32	Raven67854	GCC is old
2014-11-21 07:16:38	Raven67854	reallly old
2014-11-21 07:16:56	jaycee_	yep, too old. they shouldve started again for 4
2014-11-21 07:17:05	Raven67854	gcc5 is a start over apparently
2014-11-21 07:17:09	Raven67854	But I dunno about gcc5
2014-11-21 07:17:17	jaycee_	wouldnt surprise me, their hand is probably now being forced by llvm
2014-11-21 07:17:24	Raven67854	Well it's a good thing =)
2014-11-21 07:17:31	Raven67854	Just gcc5 is a ways off in my opinion
2014-11-21 07:17:51	jaycee_	yep, competition is good, plus i didnt like gnu having dominance
2014-11-21 07:18:17	jaycee_	because i dont trust stallman to come along and say "all code produced with gcc must be GPLv3 from now on" or something incredibly stupid like that
2014-11-21 07:18:20	Raven67854	Well nobody else wanted to make a FOSS compiler
2014-11-21 07:18:35	Raven67854	I don't think stallman can do that actually
2014-11-21 07:18:57	jaycee_	llvm was a small project until Apple started funding it, and Apple started funding it because the arrogant bastards working on gcc kept pissing them off
2014-11-21 07:19:13	Raven67854	Detect a hint of bias in that sentence :P
2014-11-21 07:19:26	jaycee_	nah, its documented
2014-11-21 07:19:32	Raven67854	The hypocrisy is strong
2014-11-21 07:19:41	jaycee_	gcc steering committee kept rejecting apples patches and contributions, pretty much "because Apple"
2014-11-21 07:20:10	 *	Raven67854 shrugs
2014-11-21 07:20:11	Raven67854	I don't care
2014-11-21 07:20:14	Raven67854	Worked out for the better
2014-11-21 07:20:19	Raven67854	We have clang and gcc
2014-11-21 07:20:51	Coolg33k	and visual studio :p
2014-11-21 07:20:58	DerRidda	"because i dont trust stallman to come along and say "all code produced with gcc must be GPLv3 from now on" or something incredibly stupid like that" That is literally the most irrational fear I have ever heard about in terms of tech.
2014-11-21 07:21:13	jaycee_	DerRidda, well, stallman is a crazy fuck
2014-11-21 07:21:23	Raven67854	Stallman is crazy about freedom to
2014-11-21 07:21:26	DerRidda	But he literally can't do that at all.

2014-11-21 07:22:02	jaycee_	i mean, he slated LLVM as "a terrible setback"
2014-11-21 07:22:13	jaycee_	mainly because - it's not GPL
2014-11-21 07:22:26	jaycee_	which is absurd
2014-11-21 07:22:38	jaycee_	ok, so... apple use it in their closed source GL shader stuff on OS X
2014-11-21 07:22:41	Leftmost	Stallman's crazy, but his views have _always_ been that the end user can do whatever the hell they want with the software itself.
2014-11-21 07:22:45	jaycee_	but guess what, so does Mesa i believe
2014-11-21 07:23:37	jaycee_	to me, open source is open source, it's "take it and use it as you want, just dont take the credit for it"
2014-11-21 07:23:44	Raven67854	Stallman just believes that all software should be free
2014-11-21 07:23:49	jaycee_	GPL is "i open sourced so now im going to do my best to force you to as well"
2014-11-21 07:23:53	Raven67854	and open
2014-11-21 07:24:06	Raven67854	And that anybody can contribute to it and modify it
2014-11-21 07:24:13	Leftmost	Well good for you. I doubt most of us in the FOSS community agree.
2014-11-21 07:24:17	Raven67854	That's the purpose of the GPL :P
2014-11-21 07:24:51	DerRidda	It's more like "Here's my code but if you use it I want you to treat everybody the way you were treated."
2014-11-21 07:24:52	Raven67854	'take it and use it as you want" <= GPL.... It just ensures that nobody can take it and close it off.
2014-11-21 07:25:19	Raven67854	I can see how you would hate that though jaycee_
2014-11-21 07:25:52	jaycee_	well forking something BSD and making it proprietary would suck
2014-11-21 07:26:03	Leftmost	The BSD license allows that.
2014-11-21 07:26:16	DerRidda	Which happens all the time.
2014-11-21 07:26:18	jaycee_	but GPL extends further than that, it becomes "anything you link this to must be GPL too"
2014-11-21 07:26:24	jaycee_	and LGPL forces you into DLL hell
2014-11-21 07:26:28	Raven67854	Stallman just believes that everybody should have access to it regardless of who develops it or on it
2014-11-21 07:27:27	jaycee_	also theres plenty of bsd/zlib type projects out there, realy useful ones, where the whole "fork and proprietarize" has not happened at all
2014-11-21 07:27:32	DerRidda	Well, nobody forces you to use GPL code in the first place. Whining about the conditions is literally entitled whining about how the free stuff you get isn't 100% the way you like it to be.
2014-11-21 07:27:39	Leftmost	For me, I feel like I put a lot of hard work into the software I write. If it's useful to you, that's great, but if I put my work into something and make it available to you to modify, I would be really pissed if you then took that hard work as the basis of something and didn't share back.
2014-11-21 07:27:43	jaycee_	zlib is a good example, everyone uses deflate
2014-11-21 07:28:14	jaycee_	Leftmost, which is fine, i agree, but what i dont agree on is that you should automatically get the rights to see inside the project i used it in
2014-11-21 07:28:21	jaycee_	contributions to the original code, sure
2014-11-21 07:28:32	DerRidda	Then use a different license.
2014-11-21 07:28:43	jaycee_	well i do, i dont use GPL'd code :)
2014-11-21 07:28:51	jaycee_	i use LGPL'd stuff if there is no alternative
2014-11-21 07:29:05	mirv_	I think GPL is pretty hard in that regard to stop people using it as a loophole to work around legal issues
2014-11-21 07:29:10	Leftmost	I use the LGPL for anything I write where there's an ABI.
2014-11-21 07:29:39	jaycee_	i would be fine with LGPL if there was a clause for static linking
2014-11-21 07:29:41	Raven67854	I don't like GPLv3.. Think he went to far with GPLv3
2014-11-21 07:29:43	jaycee_	thats why SDL2 went BSD i believe
2014-11-21 07:29:50	Raven67854	SDL2 isn't bsd
2014-11-21 07:30:04	Raven67854	It's zlib
2014-11-21 07:30:10	jaycee_	well, zlib, near enough the same
2014-11-21 07:30:21	mirv_	have a good weekend, catchyas Monday!
2014-11-21 07:30:23	Raven67854	Yeah well it's not the same considering it's zlib :P

2014-11-21 07:30:27	Raven67854	Get it right!
2014-11-21 07:30:38	jaycee_	Raven67854, in all but name it is
2014-11-21 07:31:07	Raven67854	Not really sure why zlib ever came about actually
2014-11-21 07:31:31	jaycee_	zlib is more plain english and less legalese when you read it
2014-11-21 07:31:35	jaycee_	thats about it
2014-11-21 07:31:38	Raven67854	I guess
2014-11-21 07:31:38	stqn	zlib, bsd, mit, it’s all the same
2014-11-21 07:31:58	jaycee_	and the original BSD license had some clause in it saying you had to say you were using it
2014-11-21 07:32:01	jaycee_	i think
2014-11-21 07:32:13	jaycee_	which tbh you should do anyway as a courtesy
2014-11-21 07:32:13	Raven67854	Possibly
2014-11-21 07:32:19	Raven67854	it's been revised a lot since late 80's
2014-11-21 07:33:54	Raven67854	https://fsf.org/campaigns/freejs <= okay now that makes me laugh
2014-11-21 07:33:55	GolliumBot	[ The Free JavaScript campaign — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software ] - fsf.org
2014-11-21 07:34:00	Raven67854	I will never understand JS being software
2014-11-21 07:34:06	Raven67854	when it's used on a website for common tasks
2014-11-21 07:34:29	von	err
2014-11-21 07:34:38	jaycee_	thats just a good example of stallman's stupid paranoia tbh
2014-11-21 07:34:44	von	ALL HAIL RMS
2014-11-21 07:34:46	Raven67854	Yeah but it doesn't invalid him
2014-11-21 07:34:53	Raven67854	Stallman is needed
2014-11-21 07:34:56	Raven67854	You need someone like him
2014-11-21 07:35:11	Raven67854	invalidate*
2014-11-21 07:35:13	@liamdawe	someone, just not him
2014-11-21 07:35:19	jaycee_	i might agree if JS in some bytecode format was being used
2014-11-21 07:35:37	Raven67854	No at the moment we need him :P. Because he's still alive. We'll need a replacement if something ever happens t ohim
2014-11-21 07:35:38	Leftmost	No one is saying Stallman isn't a nutbar. Just saying that "I bet he'll make gcc only usable for GPL software" is FUD of the maddest sort.
2014-11-21 07:35:39	Raven67854	to him*
2014-11-21 07:35:55	von	what's that about? non-free js interpreters? O_o
2014-11-21 07:35:56	jaycee_	but even if you strip out spaces and formatting from JS, its still source code. get an autoformatter on it and you can read it
2014-11-21 07:36:03	von	them being required?
2014-11-21 07:36:03	Leftmost	von, non-free JS.
2014-11-21 07:36:09	Raven67854	jaycee_, yeah and even if you did give your JS out to people. What good would that do
2014-11-21 07:36:14	jaycee_	von, no, "nonfree JS". he means where for example the JS isnt readily readable
2014-11-21 07:36:27	Raven67854	I always minimize my JS
2014-11-21 07:36:28	jaycee_	like where its been onelined and all the whitespace stripped out
2014-11-21 07:36:28	von	jaycee_, obfuscated or compiled?
2014-11-21 07:36:33	Leftmost	Readability has nothing to do with it. License does.
2014-11-21 07:36:37	von	(can you even compile JS?)
2014-11-21 07:36:41	Raven67854	von, yes
2014-11-21 07:36:54	Raven67854	well I guess you could dump it into bytecode
2014-11-21 07:37:12	Leftmost	Just because you have the source code to something doesn't mean you can do what you want with it.
2014-11-21 07:37:20	von	cannot it be converted back to normal?
2014-11-21 07:37:27	jaycee_	no browser loads bytecoded JS though afaik
2014-11-21 07:37:33	Raven67854	I'm just saying that even if you had source code and it was under a free license. How the fuck would that help you
2014-11-21 07:37:35	Raven67854	If you visit the page
2014-11-21 07:37:45	Raven67854	It wouldn't at all =/
2014-11-21 07:37:59	Leftmost	Raven67854, because RMS is adamantly against the use of any proprietary software.
2014-11-21 07:38:03	Leftmost	Any at all.
2014-11-21 07:38:17	Raven67854	Leftmost, I know but it contradicts itself. I mean sure you have the source but it doesn't help you in anyway =/
2014-11-21 07:38:24	Raven67854	I sure as fuck am not going back to 1995 internet
2014-11-21 07:38:24	-->	Yamagata (~james@wsip-70-166-234-2.ks.ks.cox.net) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-11-21 07:38:36	jaycee_	having the source to a C program doesnt necessarily help you
2014-11-21 07:38:41	Raven67854	Hell stallman doesn't even use CSS
2014-11-21 07:38:52	jaycee_	since as you have to be able to understand C to do anything useful with the source
2014-11-21 07:39:02	jaycee_	same applies to JS, whether its onelined or not
2014-11-21 07:39:11	Raven67854	jaycee_, I just mean that even if you hav the JS. and modify it for the website you visit. You still can't use it on said website
2014-11-21 07:39:13	Raven67854	So it's a moot point
2014-11-21 07:39:15	jaycee_	as for obsfucated JS, well, you can obsfucate any language
2014-11-21 07:39:32	jaycee_	Raven67854, well you could if you bothered to run everything through a proxy of some kind :)
2014-11-21 07:39:36	Leftmost	Raven67854, you could with a script. But who says it has to be for that website?
2014-11-21 07:39:37	Raven67854	-_-
2014-11-21 07:40:04	Leftmost	I think what the page is trying to say is that you should be able to pull JS off of a website and modify it for whatever purposes you want.
2014-11-21 07:40:15	jaycee_	no
2014-11-21 07:40:23	jaycee_	JS should have licenses the same as any source does
2014-11-21 07:40:31	Leftmost	I didn't say without license restrictions.
2014-11-21 07:40:34	Raven67854	Leftmost, yeah I just don't get the point of it
2014-11-21 07:40:35	Leftmost	I said for whatever purposes you want.
2014-11-21 07:40:41	jaycee_	if people want to make their JS open under GPL, BSD etc, they should. if they want it to be proprietary, they should
2014-11-21 07:40:51	Leftmost	Raven67854, to an extent I do. I like being able to legally co-opt JS I find sometimes.

2014-11-21 07:41:14	Leftmost	jaycee_, no one here is disagreeing.
2014-11-21 07:41:23	jaycee_	no, dont end software patents. just improve the patent system so it cant be abused like it is - for ALL kinds of patentable developments, not just software
2014-11-21 07:41:41	Raven67854	jaycee_, that is impossible
2014-11-21 07:41:44	jaycee_	good example - cyclonic vaccum cleaners
2014-11-21 07:42:08	jaycee_	Dyson spent hundreds of thousands of his own money developing that concept, after all the major manufacturers of the time turned him down
2014-11-21 07:42:12	Raven67854	The patent system is so broken I don't think that's possible
2014-11-21 07:42:34	jaycee_	he brings out cyclonic cleaners, makes them a success... and sure enough within the year, all the big manufacturers abuse the patent system and copy his idea
2014-11-21 07:42:45	DerRidda	All software comes from source code, all source code is differently written mathematical formula. mathematical formula can't be patented, therefore software can't be patented.
2014-11-21 07:43:04	Raven67854	Yeah but that's not software patents though jaycee_
2014-11-21 07:43:27	jaycee_	its the same thing, software can require r&d just as engineering can
2014-11-21 07:43:32	Raven67854	Yes it can
2014-11-21 07:43:36	jaycee_	and no, software is not just math
2014-11-21 07:43:39	DerRidda	So does math.
2014-11-21 07:43:48	Raven67854	But it's annoying to see 15 of the same software patents
2014-11-21 07:43:52	DerRidda	Let's patent that too.

2014-11-21 07:51:09	stqn	or maybe make them last a reasonable time span, like no more than 1 year.
2014-11-21 07:51:10	Raven67854	Still money to be made
2014-11-21 07:51:20	jaycee_	you really think anyone is going to spend years of their lives and their own money inventing something radical, if someone else can just come along and copy it for nothing?
2014-11-21 07:51:26	Raven67854	Yes
2014-11-21 07:51:44	Raven67854	A lot of people don't do it for the money.
2014-11-21 07:51:53	von	that would make people reinvent the wheel less often though

2014-11-21 08:07:48	ImperialXT	I HATE perl

2014-11-21 08:08:01	ImperialXT	I really really really really really hate it
2014-11-21 08:08:23	ImperialXT	there was a script written my a predecesor that checked for insecure versions of joomla, wordpress etc

2014-11-21 14:02:13	Half-Shot	But things like Gang Beasts were a mistake

2014-11-22 05:09:24	sobkas	Because Ride to Hell: Retribution came trough Greenlight? Steam need some quality control or it will end full of Bad Rats
2014-11-22 05:10:20	Cheeseness	As somebody who ran a 32 bit OS until recently, I felt like I received a lot of unnecessarily unpleasant treatment. Astro has definitely been out of line, but mocking them for using a 32 bit OS (as people did in the last thread) doesn't help anybody :(
2014-11-22 05:10:37	von	so what's the problem
2014-11-22 05:10:44	von	upgrade to 64 bit, problem solved
2014-11-22 05:11:03	Cheeseness	If they choose not to, that's fine. They just have to accept that there'll be some software that they can't run
2014-11-22 05:11:29	@Samsai	exactly, which is why i get really tired when this guy goes on a vendetta in the comments
2014-11-22 05:11:32	von	I don't see any point in whining about that
2014-11-22 05:12:01	von	every modern processor is capable of running 64 bit operating systems
2014-11-22 05:12:05	Cheeseness	I think it's fair to express a desire for 32 bit builds
2014-11-22 05:12:13	von	and it has been so for a while
2014-11-22 05:12:15	Cheeseness	But taking it beyond that is silly IMO
2014-11-22 05:12:23	von	it's fair to expect the desires not to be fullfilled
2014-11-22 05:12:41	@Samsai	in my opinion feral's response to people wanting a 32-bit build was reasonable
2014-11-22 05:13:03	Cheeseness	Feral also said that future projects might have 32 bit builds. Astro's comments here are premature
2014-11-22 05:13:24	Happy-Ferret	I don't know what's all the whining about. Give me 128 bit already, goddamnit!
2014-11-22 05:13:49	@Samsai	only 128 bits?
2014-11-22 05:14:10	zewm	Cheeseness: o/
2014-11-22 05:14:15	Cheeseness	Hey zewm
2014-11-22 05:16:35	FutureSuture	I lost all my patience with Astro when he openly admitted to telling people to tell Feral to stop porting games to Linux.
2014-11-22 05:16:35	Happy-Ferret	Samsai: if it's enough to boil the oceans, it shall be enough for me.
2014-11-22 05:16:41	FutureSuture	That just ruins it for everybody.
2014-11-22 05:17:02	FutureSuture	We have a tiny market share as is, so coupling that with an asinine attitude just makes us look like ungrateful fools.
2014-11-22 05:17:48	Raven67854	I still can't understand why you would use a 32bit linux distro up until recently. It's been stable for many of years
2014-11-22 05:18:11	Raven67854	I also don't blame them for supporting 64 bit
2014-11-22 05:18:16	Cheeseness	FutureSuture: I don't think it matters. Nobody (not even Feral) is taking Astro as indicative of the Linux using community
2014-11-22 05:18:39	Happy-Ferret	Porting PAE to mainline Linux was the worst mistake, ever. They should've dual licensed the kernel and made all 32 bit x86 PAE kernels proprietary software, with licensing costs and all.
2014-11-22 05:19:13	FutureSuture	Cheeseness, no, but Astro telling anyone who seeks him out regarding this matter to contact Feral about ceasing Linux support just wastes their time and their willingness.
2014-11-22 05:19:22	Happy-Ferret	By the time Linux first started supporting PAE, 64 bit hardware was rather common anyways.
2014-11-22 05:20:11	Cheeseness	FutureSuture: How many times do you think they've been contacted about that? I don't think much of their time has been wasted at all, and it sounds like it hasn't impacted on their motivation either
2014-11-22 05:21:09	FutureSuture	No idea, but the very act of doing so is vile.
2014-11-22 05:26:08	Cheeseness	Sure, but being aggressive towards Astro isn't going to have any positive outcomes. I see more to be gained by being empathetic and setting an example of good behaviour
2014-11-22 05:27:06	FutureSuture	That is a very good attitude to have.
2014-11-22 05:27:13	FutureSuture	Might get there someday.
2014-11-22 05:27:18	Cheeseness	^_^
2014-11-22 05:27:42	FutureSuture	But for now, every time Astro reminds us of how Feral wronged him ever so hard, I will be there to remind people how he tried to wrong the LInux community. :-)
2014-11-22 05:27:49	Happy-Ferret	They shouldn't be too overly empathetic with people holding us all back.
2014-11-22 05:28:02	Cheeseness	"holding us all back"?
2014-11-22 05:28:56	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Huh?
2014-11-22 05:29:01	DrMcCoy	Happy-Ferret: Linux had PAE since 1999 or so
2014-11-22 05:29:20	Happy-Ferret	Nay sayers are holding us all back. It's just the fact of the matter. Astro's disappointment is about as valid as some guy demanding our military lose the rifles and go back to the sword.
2014-11-22 05:29:53	Cheeseness	That's silly. People having/wanting 32 bit builds *in addition to 64 bit builds* doesn't hold anything back
2014-11-22 05:30:26	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, how many distros switched to PAE by then? Most of the bigger ones only started to offer them a few years later, when the first 64 bit CPUs had already arrived.
2014-11-22 05:30:57	DrMcCoy	Every distro that lets you compile your own kernel
2014-11-22 05:31:02	DrMcCoy	I.e. every single one
2014-11-22 05:31:21	DrMcCoy	Before the Ubuntu craze, compiling your own kernel was standard
2014-11-22 05:31:23	Happy-Ferret	Cheeseness, the time they spend on optimizing a second, outdated target is better spent on other things.
2014-11-22 05:31:24	DrMcCoy	Everybody did it
2014-11-22 05:31:38	Cheeseness	Happy-Ferret: That's Feral's determination to make, not yours :)
2014-11-22 05:31:57	Happy-Ferret	Cheeseness, it's a business decision. Of course.
2014-11-22 05:32:07	Cheeseness	And that was their reasoning for not doing so
2014-11-22 05:32:11	DrMcCoy	So what distros supported in their default kernel doesn't say shit
2014-11-22 05:33:42	DrMcCoy	Most things weren't supported in default kernels
2014-11-22 05:34:13	Happy-Ferret	DrMcCoy, right. Just how many of today's gamers compile their own kernel (BFS/BFQ crowd aside)? It bears the question whether those people whining about lack of 32 bit support are "ultra-conservative" Linux users or just clueless newcomers who downloaded 32 bit PAE Ubuntu because it was the first thing to pop up.
2014-11-22 05:35:05	-->	tewdin (~tewdin@213-243-168-44.bb.dnainternet.fi) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-11-22 05:36:10	Cheeseness	I had positive experiences with a PAE kernel up until last year
2014-11-22 05:37:38	Happy-Ferret	Literally the only thing 32 bit handles "better" is RAM usage. And that's because mainline 64 bit has some insane caching numbers.
2014-11-22 05:38:00	DrMcCoy	Cheeseness: Sure. Most programs don't need more than 4GB on their own. And the general performance loss is not really noticable
2014-11-22 05:38:06	Cheeseness	Yup
2014-11-22 05:38:17	FutureSuture	I think it's time we focused on getting Torchlight for Linux available on Steam and GOG, friends.
2014-11-22 05:38:37	mETz	yes please :)
2014-11-22 05:38:55	Cheeseness	I'd advise against hassling porters and stuff. They're busy enough as it is.
2014-11-22 05:39:08	FutureSuture	mETz, last update was half a year ago, promising a positive outcome. Nothing since.
2014-11-22 05:39:20	Cheeseness	Better to make sure that Runic understand that there's demand
2014-11-22 05:39:25	FutureSuture	Yea, but 1 update every few months are so isn't too much to ask for willing consumers.
2014-11-22 05:39:50	FutureSuture	*months or so
2014-11-22 05:39:51	Cheeseness	Why isn't it?
2014-11-22 05:39:58	Cheeseness	Surely it's up to the devs how much they want to share
2014-11-22 05:40:27	Raven67854	Keeping your customers up to date is a good thing
2014-11-22 05:40:28	Cheeseness	I mean, were we given any reason to expect those kinds of updates?
2014-11-22 05:40:32	FutureSuture	If those devs want people's money, communicating > leaving them in the dark.
2014-11-22 05:40:39	Cheeseness	Hey, don't get me wrong, I'm all for it, I'm just saying don't expect it if it wasn't offered
2014-11-22 05:40:54	FutureSuture	Cheeseness = devil's advocate, all day, every day. :P
2014-11-22 05:41:03	jeaye	Torchlight for Linux. hah
2014-11-22 05:41:17	FutureSuture	If someone said 2 + 2 equates to 4, Cheeseness would be right there with "But is it really?"
2014-11-22 05:41:19	Cheeseness	I think you'll find that's common sense's advocate :b
2014-11-22 05:41:25	jeaye	The game specifically written in the cross-platform rendering library still ends up without Linux support.
2014-11-22 05:41:31	Raven67854	FutureSuture, ha made me chuckle
2014-11-22 05:42:10	FutureSuture	And common sense dictates that communicating with your customers on a regular basis is for the better. Giving an update once every 6 months, not so much. :P
2014-11-22 05:42:14	Raven67854	jeaye, at time of launch. Wasn't really an easy way to put it on Linux and sell it
2014-11-22 05:42:27	Raven67854	Torchlight is an old game
2014-11-22 05:42:29	Cheeseness	FutureSuture: I think you're missing the point...
2014-11-22 05:42:30	Raven67854	by gaming standards
2014-11-22 05:42:40	jeaye	Ah, I'm thinking TLII.
2014-11-22 05:42:44	jeaye	Still, same shit.
2014-11-22 05:42:49	Raven67854	FutureSuture, He thinks you meant harass. For some reason he felt compelled to tell you the obvious.
2014-11-22 05:43:07	FutureSuture	Eh?
2014-11-22 05:43:11	Cheeseness	Raven67854: Not quite
2014-11-22 05:43:20	Raven67854	Cheeseness, Then I have no clue what you're on about..
2014-11-22 05:43:50	Raven67854	I'm with FutureSuture on this though. Company/porters should be fine with people asking status of said game
2014-11-22 05:44:12	Cheeseness	Porters definitely shouldn't be handling public facing PR type roles when they're just contractors
2014-11-22 05:44:17	 *	Raven67854 shrugs
2014-11-22 05:44:33	Raven67854	Then they shouldn't publicly state they're porting.
2014-11-22 05:45:00	Raven67854	If I was porting a game or developing game for Linux. I'd be delighted to be spammed to death with people asking me for updates =). Least I know people want it.
2014-11-22 05:45:14	FutureSuture	Well, whoever it is who is in charge, expecting an update once every 6 months is literally the opposite of harassing. It's being very patient. Very.
2014-11-22 05:46:28	Cheeseness	Raven67854: I would too ^_^

2014-11-22 05:46:43	Raven67854	Cheeseness, so then what the hell is the problem with FutureSuture asking? :P
2014-11-22 05:46:43	FutureSuture	I apologise if I am missing your point, Cheeseness, but it's not that common sense if Raven67854 and I aren't following with what you are trying to convey. :P
2014-11-22 05:46:54	Cheeseness	Raven67854: I don't have any problem with FutureSuture asking...
2014-11-22 05:47:01	tadzik	but just for random games that said "hey, maybe we'll get to it some day", it depends
2014-11-22 05:47:02	FutureSuture	oh my goodness xD
2014-11-22 05:47:09	Raven67854	Cheeseness, we're greatly confused by your prior statement then

2014-11-22 05:47:26	tadzik	Raven67854: shame it's not there yet
2014-11-22 05:47:29	DrMcCoy	Well, I wouldn't call Divinity a scam
2014-11-22 05:47:33	Raven67854	Cheeseness, Maybe speak less condescending and be more like a person =).
2014-11-22 05:47:39	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, No but the wait is killer
2014-11-22 05:47:45	DrMcCoy	But I don't think they're taking it as serious as they should
2014-11-22 05:47:56	Cheeseness	Raven67854: Right back atcha :D
2014-11-22 05:47:59	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, I think Yosemite really slowed them down
2014-11-22 05:48:11	Raven67854	Cheeseness, Not being condescending. FutureSuture was able to understand me fine :)
2014-11-22 05:48:19	DrMcCoy	And those "Divinity: Original Sin for game of the year 2014!" tweets...
2014-11-22 05:48:23	DrMcCoy	Are a bit galling
2014-11-22 05:48:32	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, it's a truly amazing game
2014-11-22 05:48:34	Raven67854	We should play it when we can
2014-11-22 05:48:53	Raven67854	Yosemite broke everything though.. So many broken games/apps
2014-11-22 05:52:43	FutureSuture	Well, that was a rather I am so hyped for that game, oh my goodness. D:
2014-11-22 05:53:04	Happy-Ferret	Raven67854, wow. Didn't know Yosemite broke so many things. Good thing I didn't upgrade yet.
2014-11-22 05:56:30	FutureSuture	Happy-Ferret, Yosemite broke a few things for Feral and Aspyr too last I read.
2014-11-22 05:56:41	Raven67854	Hence the Divinity Delay

2014-11-22 06:00:28	Happy-Ferret	Apparently, some people in the Amiga community now realize that building a platform on top of outdated, overly expensive PPC hardware and FPGAs might have been a bad idea. Who would've thunk.
2014-11-22 06:01:24	DrMcCoy	Should have gone for a newer ARM core
2014-11-22 06:01:31	Happy-Ferret	Just talked to someone like minded. He thinks the next generation of Amiga computers should be ARM based, with the OS running on top of a BSD kernel.
2014-11-22 06:03:24	Happy-Ferret	Personally, I'd base it on a modified Linux kernel with coreutils being replaced by something a tad more Amigaish, a custom filesystem and a window manager/desktop environment that mirrors OS 3.9

2014-11-22 06:04:03	Cheeseness	Would there be much benefit to a custom file system over stuff that's already around, do you reckon?
2014-11-22 06:04:41	Cheeseness	(I never really knew much about the Amiga file system and how it might differ from what's being used by *nix style OSes today)
2014-11-22 06:04:49	DrMcCoy	btw, anybody up to date about the btrfs status?
2014-11-22 06:04:54	Happy-Ferret	Cheeseness, when I say custom file system I basically mean something like Mac OS X. A few additional folders here, some symbolic links there.
2014-11-22 06:05:29	Cheeseness	Oh, like the folder hierarchy rather than the underlying filesystem itself?
2014-11-22 06:06:14	Happy-Ferret	Cheeseness, yea.
2014-11-22 06:06:19	Cheeseness	Yeah, cool
2014-11-22 06:07:13	Happy-Ferret	Although it would be neat to have an Amiga FFS userspace driver, so people can still read data from their old drives.
2014-11-22 06:07:28	Cheeseness	Yeah, that would be neat
2014-11-22 06:08:38	Happy-Ferret	Classic software would be launched through a rootless emulator (perhaps Janus UAE could be ported from AROS to Linux) and AROS software could be launched through the existing infrastructure (since AROS can already be hosted on Linux, it shouldn't be too hard to make that rootless).
2014-11-22 06:10:24	Happy-Ferret	I can see people complaining about any possible compatibility with existing Linux software (Amiga users are special, in that regard). But it shouldn't be too hard to "patch" this. Lol

2014-11-22 07:16:23	Cheeseness	DOSBox has built in video capture? I had no idea
2014-11-22 07:16:49	@Samsai	yeah, for some reason they don't really advertise it
2014-11-22 07:16:50	Thatsafy	yeah it has, never tried that myself as mainly ever used dosbox in school for playing Doom on IT classes :D
2014-11-22 07:17:12	@Samsai	i tested it with some descent and it worked fine
2014-11-22 07:17:37	@Samsai	framerate was a bit weird but everything was in sync and the output looked as great as possible

2014-11-22 07:33:41	romo_sapien	Good luck with the post office. That thing is government run.

2014-11-22 07:55:40	FutureSuture	Happy-Ferret, oh, so you develop software that the local businesses require?
2014-11-22 07:55:47	Happy-Ferret	I already told them that, if they wanted my software, they'd either have to run Mac OS X or let me provide them with a distribution under my control.

2014-11-22 07:56:29	Segata_Sanshiro	@Samsai, I see the guy you meant now wiith the 32-bit thing
2014-11-22 07:56:39	Happy-Ferret	FutureSuture, that was actually the reason they went to me in the first place. They need special tools that support them in their business and most of the alternatives cost an arm and a leg.
2014-11-22 07:57:19	@Samsai	Segata_Sanshiro, not that difficult to find him, just check the comments for any article that is related to feral
2014-11-22 07:57:28	FutureSuture	Happy-Ferret, so is the stuff you create open source?
2014-11-22 07:58:04	Happy-Ferret	Taking me up on my offer is essentially a no brainer. They get a stable OS and updates for free.
2014-11-22 07:58:25	Segata_Sanshiro	haha... yeah. I have to admit I'm starting to get a bit like that with Double Fine. Should analyse whether it's justified or irrational.
2014-11-22 07:58:25	Happy-Ferret	FutureSuture, yes. Part of it is actually based on existing GPL software.
2014-11-22 07:58:37	FutureSuture	Logic is not always what you find in the world of business, sadly. Still, Happy-Ferret, you know the guys so there is hope.

2014-11-22 08:00:06	Happy-Ferret	The one thing I still have to figure out is how to run iTunes and some exotic firmware hacking software on Linux, since that electronics store offers updates and hacks to Android/iOS devices.

2014-11-22 08:12:49	Happy-Ferret	One other thing I have to figure out is whether I can run scripts inside a Mac OS X pkg during installation. On Linux, I can just bundle a number of scripts and use zenity for the frontend. However, that would be a rather messy solution for Mac OS X.

2014-11-22 09:53:21	melodie	I am trying to configure steam for Ubuntu 14.10 and I ran into two issues, one with steam (I haven't got the confirmation mail for registering yet)
2014-11-22 09:53:41	melodie	and one with the installer for the game War thunder:

2014-11-22 09:53:56	melodie	I am testing games for my son, it seems a hard steep to do
2014-11-22 09:55:03	melodie	I am using Bento upgraded to 14.10 and though I have read on the steam page that the specs of the machine won't fit quite well (dual core not i7 and it's not a 64bits install) however I'd like to see how far I could go with the game

2014-11-22 09:57:59	Coolg33k	btw, you should have gone to #ubuntu-fr or #ubuntu
2014-11-22 09:58:05	Coolg33k	as it's ubuntu related
2014-11-22 09:58:07	melodie	why that?
2014-11-22 09:58:22	melodie	I don't think games are so distro specific, don't you?
2014-11-22 09:58:55	Coolg33k	don't think so, but here is not for support I think (am I wrong) ?
2014-11-22 09:59:15	tadzik	hmm, what installer is that, Steam or War Thunder?
2014-11-22 09:59:26	melodie	I don't want too much to mess with my arch install, but it's about games so I hit the irc chan of the website dedicated to the game, while I was reading the page of the game
2014-11-22 09:59:27	Coolg33k	seems war
2014-11-22 09:59:57	melodie	tadzik: yes, Coolg33k thinks it's a binary meant for 64bits so I'll have to retry in another install
2014-11-22 10:00:05	tadzik	it is on steam but has its own installer? Curious
2014-11-22 10:00:19	melodie	I have said such a think

2014-11-22 10:03:48	Coolg33k	melodie: now, unless your proc doesn't support 64b or you have a specific need, try to install 64b :)
2014-11-22 10:04:00	melodie	steam has been unable to finish the update, not sure why the error message passed too fast
2014-11-22 10:04:26	Coolg33k	how did you install it ?
2014-11-22 10:05:00	melodie	Coolg33k: I know I'll have to, just I have another install on another machine which does have the 64bits requirements, so I'll just reboot to it now (fancy setup with a dock on e-sata plus internal drive, on a T410)
2014-11-22 10:05:29	Coolg33k	seems the steam servers are out of order >_<

2014-11-22 10:07:12	melodie	no problem, if not now, I'll try again another time
2014-11-22 10:07:27	melodie	if I could just push my son out of his windows games somehow. XD

2014-11-22 11:20:00	@Samsai	this is some sort of social media suicide
2014-11-22 11:20:04	Raven67854	They just tweeted like all of the weeks tweets
2014-11-22 11:20:18	Raven67854	In 1 go
2014-11-22 11:20:27	Raven67854	Completely flooded my feed with the same shit I've seen all week
2014-11-22 11:20:41	liamdawe	yeah
2014-11-22 11:20:51	liamdawe	ive begun unfollowing certain people on gols twitter
2014-11-22 11:20:56	liamdawe	who just post out nonsense a lot
2014-11-22 11:21:18	Raven67854	I think it's great people are using Leadwerks really I do
2014-11-22 11:21:25	@Samsai	by the way, there's a new twitter sensation going on
2014-11-22 11:21:26	Raven67854	But flooding my feed with 50 tweets at the same time is a no no
2014-11-22 11:22:15	@Samsai	some people are finding and blacklisting people who follow known pro-gamergate people
2014-11-22 11:22:30	Raven67854	it's a blocklist created by an anti-gamergate who wrote some really bad python
2014-11-22 11:22:41	liamdawe	yeah i've heard bout it, it's on github i think
2014-11-22 11:22:55	Raven67854	That then IGDA decided to call everybody on it the worst harassers...
2014-11-22 11:23:03	Raven67854	The blocklist has been around for a few weeks
2014-11-22 11:24:49	@Samsai	it's great that people are not pouring more fuel into the flames
2014-11-22 11:25:06	Raven67854	gamergates stronger than ever now
2014-11-22 11:25:14	@Samsai	i think i forgot my /sarcasm tag
2014-11-22 11:25:25	Raven67854	Samsai, It's not needed :P
2014-11-22 11:25:59	sobkas	Raven67854: "bad python" because it's perl?
2014-11-22 11:26:07	Raven67854	sobkas, no it's just lousy code
2014-11-22 11:26:15	Raven67854	Oh wait it's perl isn't it :P
2014-11-22 11:26:56	@Samsai	looks like perl
2014-11-22 11:27:42	@Samsai	hmm... i think i have a better way of blocking out the gg people
2014-11-22 11:27:58	@Samsai	deleting your twitter
2014-11-22 11:28:01	Raven67854	Samsai, I'd prefer not to block people purely because of gg
2014-11-22 11:28:06	von	lol
2014-11-22 11:28:10	Raven67854	I'd rather not live in a damn bubble
2014-11-22 11:28:21	Raven67854	Both sides can come to me..
2014-11-22 11:28:28	@Samsai	Raven67854, i follow people from both sides as well
2014-11-22 11:28:29	Raven67854	my feeds filled with people on both sides
2014-11-22 11:28:37	von	but, but... it is so nice to judge people by only one label and / or one action!
2014-11-22 11:28:51	@Samsai	yeah, and everything can only be black or white
2014-11-22 11:28:52	Raven67854	von, yeah it's silly
2014-11-22 11:28:55	@Samsai	and it's either us or them
2014-11-22 11:29:09	Thatsafy	haven't actually read a single tweet regarding gamergate, lucky me
2014-11-22 11:29:30	@Samsai	Thatsafy, want me to retweet some of this stuff?
2014-11-22 11:29:37	@Samsai	i believe you still follow me on twitter
2014-11-22 11:29:52	Thatsafy	samsai, wan't me to unfollow you on twitter and unsub on tubes?
2014-11-22 11:30:13	@Samsai	Thatsafy, well, you can unsub the old channel
2014-11-22 11:32:16	Raven67854	Thatsafy, that seems a bit extreme

2014-11-22 11:35:19	sobkas	so what did gg-ers did for their perceived goal of ethics in gaming journalism?
2014-11-22 11:35:28	Raven67854	No idea
2014-11-22 11:35:38	@Samsai	i guess they tweeted something
2014-11-22 11:35:41	Raven67854	I'm not pro or anti gamergate
2014-11-22 11:35:47	Raven67854	So I have no fucking clue
2014-11-22 11:36:17	@Samsai	who even knows these days?
2014-11-22 11:36:24	Raven67854	I do know that I found matches

2014-11-22 11:36:39	Raven67854	Thank you Samsai
2014-11-22 11:37:26	@Samsai	i need to find my friend from the depths of the internet to get him to make a promo video for that new youtube channel
2014-11-22 11:37:52	Raven67854	Samsai, that's a scary part of the net to go to
2014-11-22 11:38:00	@Samsai	indeed
2014-11-22 11:38:28	Raven67854	sobkas, I do know this though. I've seen a lot of god awful mean shit from both sides and it saddens me that people find such behavior acceptable.
2014-11-22 11:38:50	Raven67854	Samsai, Want some company? I can go with you if you want. Maybe then you won't get consumed

2014-11-22 11:41:06	Raven67854	Can I ask you something about it?
2014-11-22 11:41:07	Raven67854	Kinda new to it
2014-11-22 11:41:13	@Samsai	Raven67854, sure, go ahead
2014-11-22 11:41:15	sobkas	Raven67854: but one side is a bit more vicious and more concentrated on making other people suffer while other is their victims
2014-11-22 11:41:34	Raven67854	sobkas, No I've seen stupidity on both sides. And the most vicious side I've seen is anit gamergate
2014-11-22 11:41:39	Raven67854	anti*
2014-11-22 11:41:58	Raven67854	Sorry but when you say you want to gas an entire group of people for using a hashtag you've gone full fucking crazy
2014-11-22 11:42:11	@Samsai	only victims in the GG debacle are the people who got caught in the crossfire
2014-11-22 11:42:30	Raven67854	Samsai, Pretty much
2014-11-22 11:42:33	@Samsai	like the people who are being called harassers for following the wrong people
2014-11-22 11:42:40	sobkas	Raven67854: well it's hard to beat threats of mass shootings
2014-11-22 11:42:54	Raven67854	sobkas, Mass gassing of an entire group of people
2014-11-22 11:43:26	sobkas	Raven67854:?
2014-11-22 11:43:29	Raven67854	Also the mass shooting I assume you're referring to of the utah incident with Anita. Was never confirmed to have ever come from a gamergate. Just someone who hates her. Facts are facts
2014-11-22 11:43:44	Raven67854	sobkas, that was my response to it's hard to beat threats of mass shootings. Someone saying lets gas everyone who uses #gamergate
2014-11-22 11:44:30	Thatsafy	why are you discussing gamergate, I don't like this, this is scary. I want my blanket.
2014-11-22 11:44:43	@Samsai	#blanketgate
2014-11-22 11:45:36	Raven67854	Samsai, What settings do you  use for the encoder? Trying to get the settings correct. I mean quality wise it's fine. but file size wise it's just absurd :P
2014-11-22 11:46:31	sobkas	Raven67854: it's hard to compare threats to a concrete person in a know location to a task of finding everyone using gg tag and gassing them
2014-11-22 11:46:34	@Samsai	Raven67854, h.264 with video bitrate of 2000k
2014-11-22 11:46:41	@Samsai	720p 30 fps
2014-11-22 11:46:41	Raven67854	Samsai, damn that's low
2014-11-22 11:47:01	@Samsai	Raven67854, if i go any higher it's going to take way too long to upload the videos
2014-11-22 11:47:04	Raven67854	sobkas, But again the utah incident was never confirmed or proven to have from someone from Gamergate. So it has nothing to do with gamergate
2014-11-22 11:47:18	Raven67854	sobkas, I'm neither pro or against. But I care a hell of a lot about facts
2014-11-22 11:47:36	Raven67854	You can't just say it's true and it be true. Facts or it's irrelevant
2014-11-22 11:47:41	sobkas	Raven67854: gamergate is like anonymous
2014-11-22 11:47:49	Raven67854	sobkas, Still doesn't prove anything
2014-11-22 11:47:59	Thatsafy	samsai, my latest videos have all been at 16Mbps :D 2Mbps uhh
2014-11-22 11:48:05	Raven67854	There's also confirmed 3rd party's trolling both sides

2014-11-22 11:49:12	@Samsai	with 0.8 mbps you can only do so much
2014-11-22 11:49:16	Thatsafy	Raven67854 I'm pretty sure bitrates are in fact in Mbps, NOT MBps
2014-11-22 11:49:19	Raven67854	sobkas, I haven't even looked into that. I don't really follow either or. So if you can enlighten me on it. I'd be happy to look =).
2014-11-22 11:49:22	@Samsai	that's up, down is like 6.8

2014-11-22 11:49:56	Thatsafy	and Samsai, when I had 0.8Mbps up, I still had average 8Mbps videos, at times even 16Mbps when doing 1080p
2014-11-22 11:50:06	Raven67854	Thatsafy, upload overnight :P
2014-11-22 11:50:26	Thatsafy	Raven67854 or during day when at school/work
2014-11-22 11:50:33	Raven67854	for 1080P the recommend is 8000kb
2014-11-22 11:50:40	sobkas	Raven67854: so you don't know and yet say that both sides are as bad?
2014-11-22 11:50:45	Raven67854	Thatsafy, Or that!
2014-11-22 11:50:51	Raven67854	sobkas, I've seen so much shit flinging from both sides that yes
2014-11-22 11:50:52	Raven67854	Both sides are bad
2014-11-22 11:50:58	Raven67854	Neither side is good
2014-11-22 11:51:04	Raven67854	Both sides send death threats
2014-11-22 11:51:27	Raven67854	Anti-gamergate sent what's his name a knife and a syringe and told him to kill himself for supporting gamergate
2014-11-22 11:51:36	Raven67854	Sorry but no you completely invalidate your argument at that point
2014-11-22 11:52:11	Raven67854	KingOfPol I think it was. I can't keep up with it
2014-11-22 11:52:22	Raven67854	Like I said sobkas I only care about facts :)
2014-11-22 11:52:30	Raven67854	Facts! Honesty! Rare fucking things in the modern age
2014-11-22 11:53:06	Raven67854	Thatsafy, I've uploaded videos with a bitrate of 50,000kb... It's damn ridiculous the way youtube butchers that down
2014-11-22 11:55:01	Thatsafy	Raven67854 well that's why I use only 16Mbps as I have now connection to support that, 50Mbps near the bitrate I record at.
2014-11-22 11:55:24	Thatsafy	and over 16Mbps for gaming content is overkill
2014-11-22 11:55:45	Thatsafy	but hey, codec and settings matter too
2014-11-22 11:55:48	Raven67854	won't make a difference because of what youtube does to it :P
2014-11-22 11:55:58	Raven67854	60FPS footage though mmm that's nice
2014-11-22 11:56:14	Thatsafy	well I did record my latest 12 videos at 60fps
2014-11-22 11:56:19	Thatsafy	so hence high bitrate

2014-11-22 12:03:05	Raven67854	Not everyone against gg is evil
2014-11-22 12:03:16	Raven67854	Don't blatantly label people because of a few bad people.
2014-11-22 12:03:41	von	but, but... it makes it more simple and makes you feel just!
2014-11-22 12:03:53	Raven67854	von, haha I know right
2014-11-22 12:04:24	sobkas	Raven67854: I don't like that you draw equal sign between gg and it's victims
2014-11-22 12:04:40	Raven67854	sobkas, I care about facts
2014-11-22 12:04:57	Raven67854	And I don't label people for using a hashtag
2014-11-22 12:05:11	von	well, to be fair
2014-11-22 12:05:14	von	they label themselves
2014-11-22 12:05:17	von	:)
2014-11-22 12:05:38	Raven67854	von, True but he's saying everybody who uses the #gamergate hashtag is a harasser and people who they fight against at victims
2014-11-22 12:05:48	Raven67854	them* not at silly me
2014-11-22 12:05:50	sobkas	Raven67854: fact is that gg organized to harass people
2014-11-22 12:06:00	@Samsai	is it though?
2014-11-22 12:06:01	Raven67854	sobkas, I could say the same for anti-gamergate using your logic
2014-11-22 12:06:08	von	judging intentions.

2014-11-22 12:07:38	sobkas	Raven67854: there is one problem, with gg many people using 4chan, 8chan and more collaborated to make they enemies lives as bad as possible
2014-11-22 12:07:46	Raven67854	I'm sorry sobkas but I will always try to give people benefit of the doubt and keep an open mind. And as always facts come before anything else.
2014-11-22 12:08:12	von	who needs facts? They are already labeled.
2014-11-22 12:08:42	von	(other variant: facts are for teh apologists!)
2014-11-22 12:08:44	Raven67854	sobkas, Okay well I have a counter example to what you said. http://i.imgur.com/6yd2J3p.png
2014-11-22 12:09:07	Raven67854	Igda used a blocklist made by an anti-gamergater. Called everybody on it the worst offenders(apparently KFC is an offender)
2014-11-22 12:09:37	Raven67854	sobkas, Also they both use 4chan/8chan
2014-11-22 12:09:41	Raven67854	Like I siad

2014-11-22 12:10:50	von	Raven67854, wait you use autocorrect? O_o
2014-11-22 12:11:02	Raven67854	von, Yeah I have autocorrect.. I just turned it off
2014-11-22 12:11:26	von	Raven67854, any death threats? I hear them are all over the place these days
2014-11-22 12:11:26	sobkas	Raven67854: so it's the worst thing you could find?
2014-11-22 12:11:38	Raven67854	sobkas, what's the worst thing I could find?
2014-11-22 12:11:45	Raven67854	von, Yeah there's plenty of death threats on both sides
2014-11-22 12:12:12	Raven67854	So I just don't care about either side anymore. They wanna act like children fine. I'll just sit and continue to not harming or doing bad towards people while they self implode
2014-11-22 12:12:16	von	#DeathThreats
2014-11-22 12:12:25	Raven67854	In other words I'm gonna sit here, work, drink my bourbon and smoke my cigar into an early grave :P
2014-11-22 12:13:18	liamdawe	oh back to GG again i see
2014-11-22 12:13:26	Raven67854	liamdawe, we never left
2014-11-22 12:13:36	sobkas	Raven67854: you say that both sides are as bad
2014-11-22 12:13:39	von	needz moar controversy :)
2014-11-22 12:13:40	Raven67854	von, do you have bourbon in the motherland
2014-11-22 12:13:50	sobkas	Raven67854: and that is not true
2014-11-22 12:13:58	Raven67854	sobkas, why is it not true
2014-11-22 12:14:05	Raven67854	Both sides send death threats
2014-11-22 12:14:07	von	Raven67854, yeah, but with Ruble dropping below ground it's going to get pretty expensive
2014-11-22 12:14:09	Raven67854	Both sides harass the other
2014-11-22 12:14:33	Raven67854	von, Oh man that's awful! I'm not a fan of vodka. So I'd probably suffer if I was in Russia at the moment
2014-11-22 12:14:46	von	I prefer Rum myself
2014-11-22 12:14:56	Raven67854	von, Is rum pricey or cheap?
2014-11-22 12:15:08	von	pricey, but I don't drink that often
2014-11-22 12:15:13	Raven67854	Fair enough
2014-11-22 12:15:31	von	there are also very nice variety of mead vodka with pepper
2014-11-22 12:15:38	Raven67854	I don't drink that much either but I do love some bourbon
2014-11-22 12:16:19	von	s/are/is/,s/variety/kind/
2014-11-22 12:16:19	GolliumBot	von meant to say: there is also very nice variety of mead vodka with pepper
2014-11-22 12:16:23	von	lol
2014-11-22 12:16:31	von	GolliumBot, your sed is weak.
2014-11-22 12:16:35	Raven67854	nice fix..
2014-11-22 12:18:57	Raven67854	von, I've never had mead vodka
2014-11-22 12:19:34	von	I don't really know how to properly call it in English tbh, it's the closest I can come up with
2014-11-22 12:19:42	Raven67854	von, what it's like
2014-11-22 12:19:56	sobkas	Raven67854: from my perspective I saw more harassment generated by gg than the other "side"
2014-11-22 12:20:05	Raven67854	sobkas, Okay
2014-11-22 12:20:29	Raven67854	sobkas, I just get the feeling and impression you think I'm pro gamergate. I don't support either side
2014-11-22 12:20:43	Raven67854	And I think people who are victims of harassment should go to the police not fucking twitter
2014-11-22 12:21:07	sobkas	Raven67854: so that police can ignore them
2014-11-22 12:21:18	von	Raven67854, kinda hard to explain. sweet, but strong and hot at the same time.
2014-11-22 12:21:25	Raven67854	von, hmm may have to try and find
2014-11-22 12:21:51	Raven67854	sobkas, Well that happens everywhere. So instead of going to twitter and complaining about it. Go out and change your local community!

2014-11-22 12:22:32	von	Raven67854, I find that attitude pretty common tbh. “Those who are not with us are against us.” No middle ground.

2014-11-22 12:22:41	Raven67854	von, yes...

2014-11-22 12:25:32	Raven67854	Yes
2014-11-22 12:25:58	@Samsai	neither of them is an organized group
2014-11-22 12:26:05	Raven67854	For all I know people on the antigamergate side fake being apart of the GG to discredit it
2014-11-22 12:26:15	Raven67854	Hence my facts only approach
2014-11-22 12:26:31	sobkas	and when something bad happens suddenly perpetrator is not a true gamergate
2014-11-22 12:26:37	liamdawe	Samsai: if you're not busy, could you give the editorial someone submitted a look over for any edits, i've tried doing a bunch more with re-wording to make sense, but keeping the original thoughts, but need another look
2014-11-22 12:27:02	@Samsai	liamdawe, yeah, i can take a look
2014-11-22 12:27:06	Raven67854	sobkas, Yep it's why leaderless movements are damn near impossible
2014-11-22 12:27:20	Raven67854	And again this brings me back to me saying both sides are awful
2014-11-22 12:28:32	sobkas	"antigamergate side fake being apart of the GG to discredit it" are you sure?

2014-11-22 15:00:58	Happy-Ferret	I'm starting to really hate Mozilla. Some of their devs seem to take great pride in intentionally breaking things and replacing them with half-assed solutions that are worse than the things they broke in the first place.

2014-11-22 15:22:18	Happy-Ferret	I just tried to build an .app bundle for Mac OS X, using Xulrunner's internal abilities. Unfortunately, I soon found out that --install-app has been replaced by an external script called install-app.py. This isn't documented anywhere, nor does any Xulrunner related documentation mention the location of install-app.py
2014-11-22 15:23:13	Happy-Ferret	I eventually found out that I'd have to download the source of Xulrunner, since it's only included there. Having done so, I ran into a couple of issues and eventually returned to an earlier release of Xulrunner.
2014-11-22 15:23:35	Happy-Ferret	That being said, --install-app doesn't really work either, so I'm now forced to manually bundle the application.

2014-11-23 16:23:58	Nothing_Much	I have no idea what that is
2014-11-23 16:24:28	Nothing_Much	popey: I just dislike outdated interfaces, and especially context/submenus

2014-11-23 16:24:53	Nothing_Much	oh god, if XFCE would just update itself to look a lot less fugly and actually make a decent search menu
2014-11-23 16:24:58	Nothing_Much	wait, I think it did
2014-11-23 16:25:02	Nothing_Much	did it?
2014-11-23 16:25:03	EXetoC	really, similar performance for APUs on linux and windows? who knows, maybe A10-7850k is more optimized than A10-5800k

2014-11-23 16:25:20	popey	also, what is yaourt?

2014-11-23 16:25:24	Nothing_Much	EXetoC: the kaveri APUs are optimized in general
2014-11-23 16:25:26	popey	sounds like a medical problem

2014-11-23 16:25:33	von	popey, a wrapper around pacman and aur
2014-11-23 16:25:45	Nothing_Much	.. according to terminal enthusiasts

2014-11-23 16:25:55	EXetoC	Nothing_Much: trinity less so?
2014-11-23 16:25:58	MBitRic2	yaourt is like apt but "better" for me personally
2014-11-23 16:26:19	Nothing_Much	from what I know, apt-get is bad, but apt I think makes things work a bit faster
2014-11-23 16:26:19	von	yaourt promotes installing packages from aur blindly
2014-11-23 16:26:25	Nothing_Much	and it looks nice
2014-11-23 16:26:37	MBitRic2	thx von
2014-11-23 16:26:47	Nothing_Much	okay, somebody listen to von about arch linux, because he can make arguments that actually speak technical about that distro
2014-11-23 16:26:56	von	that's about the only reason to dislike it imo
2014-11-23 16:27:04	Nothing_Much	alls I got is that the community is crap
2014-11-23 16:27:09	Nothing_Much	otherwise, arch is decent I guess
2014-11-23 16:27:12	EXetoC	I always look at the top first
2014-11-23 16:27:29	popey	ah okay
2014-11-23 16:27:38	EXetoC	the fact that you can't press enter sometimes is a little annoying, that's all

2014-11-23 16:28:42	von	I've been using cower ever since slurpy was deprecated
2014-11-23 16:28:56	Nothing_Much	speak english please
2014-11-23 16:29:22	EXetoC	I hope trinity is ever optimized then if kaveri is indeed faster
2014-11-23 16:29:31	Nothing_Much	or richland
2014-11-23 16:29:39	Nothing_Much	either way, fuck x86

2014-11-23 16:30:03	von	out  of all the aur helpers available cower seems to be the fastest
2014-11-23 16:30:12	EXetoC	"press enter to return" I guess
2014-11-23 16:30:36	Nothing_Much	I thought return came before enter when keyboards were typewriters

2014-11-23 16:30:53	EXetoC	Nothing_Much: why? ARM can't quite match the performance, right? The mill architecture seems interesting though, but that's years away
2014-11-23 16:30:55	Nothing_Much	remember those things? i don't
2014-11-23 16:31:04	Nothing_Much	mill?
2014-11-23 16:31:46	EXetoC	yes, a lot more throughput per watt or something like that

2014-11-24 03:25:48	FutureSuture	Hopefully a developer's word still means something nowadays.
2014-11-24 03:25:56	von	as I've said. They don't care.

2014-11-24 03:39:52	Sik	Well, I know that in many cases Mac games don't end up getting released in other stores because they're outsourced ports and there are licensing issues getting in the way (in particular, how stores want to be able for a single sale to count for all OSes), so I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing happens with Linux
2014-11-24 03:40:38	Sik	"other stores" as in "not where they were originally released"
2014-11-24 03:41:08	Sik	This is what happens when you make the porting company the publisher of said port
2014-11-24 03:41:52	Sik	(or even just promising them royalties for every sale of the port... but if the same sale counts for all OSes, how do you determine that?)

2014-11-24 03:42:46	von	but that's mostly because they have their own client with drm
2014-11-24 03:43:14	Sik	Doesn't Steam still require that a single sale is valid for all OSes on which the game works?
2014-11-24 03:43:15	von	how one would do that with HB or GOG I don't really know
2014-11-24 03:43:31	von	steamplay is optional

2014-11-24 03:45:34	Sik	(and you better hope that pressing space didn't cause any side effect!)

2014-11-24 05:26:27	Beamboom	It's not done yet though - only in Early Access yet though

2014-11-24 05:27:13	Raven67854	Beamboom, I'm aware and it's still a crappy game
2014-11-24 05:27:17	Raven67854	Despite being out for over a year now
2014-11-24 05:27:23	Raven67854	Gameplay is still mostly the same
2014-11-24 05:27:44	Beamboom	being available for beta testing for a year does not mean the same as being launched since a year
2014-11-24 05:28:05	Raven67854	Beamboom, It went into EA last year in august
2014-11-24 05:28:09	tadzik	Beamboom, you defending indies? :P
2014-11-24 05:28:10	Raven67854	Anybody with $35 could get it
2014-11-24 05:28:17	jhw	its even labled alpha
2014-11-24 05:28:20	jhw	not beta
2014-11-24 05:28:22	Raven67854	Agreed
2014-11-24 05:28:26	Raven67854	And it's still not fun to play
2014-11-24 05:28:30	Raven67854	Which is my entire point
2014-11-24 05:28:39	Beamboom	I just want to establish the difference between "Early Access" and a *released* game
2014-11-24 05:28:44	Raven67854	I dunno why people have to argue about this. "But it's not done yet!" I'm aware it's not done yet
2014-11-24 05:28:48	tadzik	I think raven's point is "finished or not, if it sucks already it will continue sucking"
2014-11-24 05:29:03	Raven67854	Beamboom, Oh please stop cherry picking
2014-11-24 05:29:20	Raven67854	It's obvious I meant released as in available and not finished. Hell I even said I'm aware it's not finished
2014-11-24 05:29:22	tadzik	the reason why you build a game prototype before you invest money into it is because if the prototype is fun the finished game will be too, but if it's not, the finished game probably also won't  be
2014-11-24 05:29:36	Raven67854	It's just that in the past year the gameplay hasn't changed that much.
2014-11-24 05:29:43	Raven67854	And it's still a meh game
2014-11-24 05:29:51	Beamboom	No it's not cherry picking, it's a problem these days with this beta nonsense called "Earl Access"
2014-11-24 05:29:57	zewm	Raven67854: o/
2014-11-24 05:30:05	Raven67854	It could end up being a good game. But after a year I'm starting to think it's just the way it'll play
2014-11-24 05:30:10	Raven67854	Beamboom, first off it's in alpha not beta
2014-11-24 05:30:14	Raven67854	zewm, \o
2014-11-24 05:30:21	Beamboom	It's uterly ridiculous that gamers even PAY to test unfinished code
2014-11-24 05:30:26	Raven67854	Yep
2014-11-24 05:30:27	Raven67854	But again

2014-11-24 05:31:34	von	360 controller is a great device
2014-11-24 05:31:35	Beamboom	zewm, sory F710. It works out of the box on Linux, has rumble and above all; Is wireless
2014-11-24 05:31:50	zewm	Beamboom: how is the support for games?
2014-11-24 05:31:56	von	say what you want about Microsoft, but that controller is awesome.
2014-11-24 05:32:05	zewm	I have the wireless xbox controller, can I just get the cable or do I need a PC specific version?
2014-11-24 05:32:19	Raven67854	von, XboxOne controller is even nicer. Microsoft makes a nice controller
2014-11-24 05:32:20	von	cable is only for charging

2014-11-24 05:32:28	Beamboom	It works on all gamnes that support gamepads. It has two modes, one to emulate Xbox controller and another who I can't remnember the name of now

2014-11-24 05:32:48	tadzik	I love wired stuff
2014-11-24 05:32:54	zewm	Yea, I only do wired

2014-11-24 05:33:00	Raven67854	I have a wired version I bought in 2007
2014-11-24 05:33:01	zewm	I don't do wireless at all
2014-11-24 05:33:01	von	I mean, xbone controller
2014-11-24 05:33:12	Raven67854	Still works and is very solid
2014-11-24 05:33:17	Raven67854	zewm, then I would go with 360 then
2014-11-24 05:33:19	zewm	von: Yea, generally all the generations of xb pads have been good
2014-11-24 05:33:20	Raven67854	von, Probably not
2014-11-24 05:33:29	von	so yeah, zewm, get a receiver for it and you'll probably be good to go
2014-11-24 05:33:31	zewm	K, I'll look into picking one up today
2014-11-24 05:33:34	Beamboom	I usually don't do wireless either, but after a decade with a PS3 I just won't go back to a wired controller. Especially when it works as well as the f710
2014-11-24 05:33:50	Raven67854	For long gameplays wireless sucks
2014-11-24 05:33:50	von	although I hear getting receivers for 360 wireless pad can be a pain

2014-11-24 05:34:11	Beamboom	Raven67854, the f710 works for TENS of hours without battery replacent

2014-11-24 05:34:38	zewm	I had some wireless keyboard/mouse in the past

2014-11-24 05:34:42	zewm	and not good experiences
2014-11-24 05:34:42	Raven67854	Beamboom, Wired.. always works ^_^
2014-11-24 05:35:12	Beamboom	zewm, yeah me too, I'd never want a wireless keyb/mouse ever
2014-11-24 05:35:19	von	I don't trust wireless personally, but more in terms of latency really =/
2014-11-24 05:35:29	Raven67854	von, It's generally okay actually
2014-11-24 05:35:39	Beamboom	Yeah I agree with that too. But I van't say I've noticed any
2014-11-24 05:35:39	von	although I don't use them, so maybe I'm just wrong about that
2014-11-24 05:35:41	Raven67854	I know the Xbox controllers/PS3 controllers are anyway
2014-11-24 05:36:00	Raven67854	3rd party's can be hit or miss probably

2014-11-24 05:36:17	von	I've played some PS3 last year
2014-11-24 05:36:27	Raven67854	I prefer the PS4 controller
2014-11-24 05:36:27	von	haven't noticed any problems with it
2014-11-24 05:36:28	Beamboom	I wanted a bigger one than the ps3, so I shopped around. But I quickly returned to the dualshock
2014-11-24 05:36:29	Raven67854	But i hate it's battery life
2014-11-24 05:36:41	Raven67854	PS3's controller is meh

2014-11-24 05:37:29	zewm	ah okay
2014-11-24 05:37:31	Raven67854	I bet it'd even work on the PS3 to be fair
2014-11-24 05:37:37	zewm	I wasn't sure if the xbox one only worked on the console

2014-11-24 05:59:21	guig33k	sometime i tired of linux
2014-11-24 05:59:34	guig33k	you pass your time to do other thing to make it running

2014-11-24 06:01:10	gkeen_	there is something wrong no matter what phone or computer you have
2014-11-24 06:01:26	EXetoC	few people claims it's the best for everything
2014-11-24 06:01:49	drumr	depends on what you do with computing
2014-11-24 06:01:56	guig33k	for playing is very far from the best
2014-11-24 06:02:01	drumr	gaming has come a long way
2014-11-24 06:02:08	EXetoC	industry support is important, and it is lacking in some areas. I couldn't do system administration or development elsewhere
2014-11-24 06:02:12	gkeen_	guig33k: best for you is probably a Nintendo Wii (unmodded) :P
2014-11-24 06:02:24	gkeen_	if you want zero trouble
2014-11-24 06:02:24	gkeen_	:D
2014-11-24 06:02:26	guig33k	i like computer gam

2014-11-24 06:02:33	guig33k	i like firefall i cannot play
2014-11-24 06:03:05	drumr	you have to blame the developer not the system. the system exist, they choose not to support
2014-11-24 06:03:11	drumr	in many cases
2014-11-24 06:03:15	guig33k	all game run on windows so few game run on linux and even native game not work well
2014-11-24 06:03:48	drumr	if you want the best compat with games on linux debian derivatives have the best support
2014-11-24 06:04:15	drumr	firefall is too heavy on direct x
2014-11-24 06:04:29	drumr	blame the industry for being too dependent on directx for gaming
2014-11-24 06:04:46	gkeen_	isnt Half-Life 3 gonna be linux only?
2014-11-24 06:04:46	drumr	thats where your fustration should be aimed at
2014-11-24 06:04:50	gkeen_	i think i read that somewhere
2014-11-24 06:05:03	drumr	half life 3 has been vaporware for years
2014-11-24 06:05:08	EXetoC	linux only lol
2014-11-24 06:05:09	drumr	its the next duke nukem
2014-11-24 06:05:10	EXetoC	sure
2014-11-24 06:05:53	Raven67854	Valve specifically said they wouldn't put any title exclusive to any one platform
2014-11-24 06:06:06	drumr	which is smart
2014-11-24 06:06:17	Raven67854	HL3 would move SteamOS though
2014-11-24 06:06:21	Raven67854	if it was a timed exclusive :p
2014-11-24 06:06:25	drumr	but valve doesnt really make games anymore, they make money
2014-11-24 06:06:40	drumr	probably get it first on steamos and then roll out to other platforms after
2014-11-24 06:07:04	Raven67854	Been so long now
2014-11-24 06:07:07	drumr	ea released the crysis servers as linux
2014-11-24 06:07:12	Raven67854	The hype train could potentially kill HL3
2014-11-24 06:07:24	drumr	yup
2014-11-24 06:07:47	Raven67854	I was surprised valve didn't say anything about HL2's 10th year
2014-11-24 06:08:04	EXetoC	it's annoying how it keeps getting mentioned, and I've only ever finished HL1 :p
2014-11-24 06:08:16	drumr	yeah but they are roling in so much $team money its easy to forget

2014-11-24 06:10:13	drumr	why cant games
2014-11-24 06:10:17	tadzik	valve released 2 games last year
2014-11-24 06:13:17	flesk_	HL3 wouldn't have to be Linux exclusive to sell Steam Machines I think. As longs as it's not on PS4 and XBone, that's still a major selling point.
2014-11-24 06:14:00	drumr	if they release it a little earlier there are a segment of gaming population that will buy steamos box just for it
2014-11-24 06:14:40	drumr	games made for cryengine could be recompiled for compatibility with linux
2014-11-24 06:14:57	drumr	cryengine for linux is available to licensees
2014-11-24 06:15:04	drumr	last a saw pubicly
2014-11-24 06:17:35	drumr	when i first got into linux 14 years ago or so
2014-11-24 06:17:39	drumr	it has come a long way
2014-11-24 06:18:14	drumr	for gaming among other programs
2014-11-24 06:18:45	drumr	if your going to be made at anyone it is to be the publishers and developers, not the platform
2014-11-24 06:19:23	drumr	now the many variances and such in the distros makings thing more difficult to do different things is justified.
2014-11-24 06:19:36	drumr	i recently tried to pick up debian after using fedora for a while
2014-11-24 06:19:58	drumr	there are enough issues there to make me pull my hair out but i can work trhough them even if it means going back to fedora
2014-11-24 06:20:02	EXetoC	you have more than just the engine to worry about though
2014-11-24 06:20:19	drumr	i dont recommend debian for gaming
2014-11-24 06:20:24	drumr	fedora yes
2014-11-24 06:20:37	drumr	im nt on the ubuntu bandwagon
2014-11-24 06:20:50	drumr	so it may be easier there for a debian based distro
2014-11-24 06:21:00	EXetoC	but it doesn't have packages for driver blobs, right?
2014-11-24 06:21:14	EXetoC	so I don't know about that
2014-11-24 06:21:27	drumr	if you have nvdia debian has it easier
2014-11-24 06:21:36	drumr	there drivers are maintained in a repo
2014-11-24 06:21:40	drumr	their
2014-11-24 06:21:53	drumr	so you can update with the other updates
2014-11-24 06:22:12	drumr	you dont want to use the default drivers
2014-11-24 06:22:17	drumr	its terrible
2014-11-24 06:22:33	drumr	amd has made it somehwat easy to update and have drivers that make games run smoth
2014-11-24 06:22:48	drumr	now if you are talking about hardware/peripherals

2014-11-24 06:23:16	drumr	i did have one issue with debian and a wifi usb adapter
2014-11-24 06:23:31	drumr	but thats because the dfriver for it was blacklisted in the distro
2014-11-24 06:23:41	drumr	so i had to find out how to take it off and it worked fine
2014-11-24 06:23:51	drumr	it was an older driver but not too old

2014-11-24 06:25:16	drumr	they make so much money but they also piss it away
2014-11-24 06:25:27	drumr	i have more sympathy for the smaller ones
2014-11-24 06:25:47	drumr	however we also live in an age of console ports
2014-11-24 06:26:03	EXetoC	good old profit motive
2014-11-24 06:26:09	drumr	i had it when i bought crysis 2 on day one and the pc versions said to press start at the beginning
2014-11-24 06:26:37	neffo	thats hardly new
2014-11-24 06:26:41	drumr	you have to pay your expenses
2014-11-24 06:26:42	neffo	that's going back to arcades
2014-11-24 06:27:28	drumr	sure but for the first version of a game to be pc only at first then get ported to console and how much it impressed the community the second go round was disappointing
2014-11-24 06:29:25	drumr	i remember when dirextx first game on the scene
2014-11-24 06:29:30	drumr	microsoft was pretty proud of it
2014-11-24 06:29:58	drumr	they wanted to make sure when you installed a game that you knew it was made with directx
2014-11-24 06:30:49	drumr	back then linux was in its infancy and everything else was business only
2014-11-24 06:31:06	drumr	dos and windows was pretty much it unless you had a mac
2014-11-24 06:31:17	drumr	or apple II
2014-11-24 06:32:45	drumr	a lot of kids were playing games on commodore64 back then too and amiga

2014-11-24 06:33:03	mirv_	I had a tandy!
2014-11-24 06:33:18	drumr	yeah they were popular back late 80s
2014-11-24 06:34:25	neffo	direct3d was like 96/97 i thought
2014-11-24 06:34:50	drumr	i remember sitting at my friends packard bell pentium machine in 94 or 95
2014-11-24 06:34:56	drumr	and seeing dirextx for the first time
2014-11-24 06:35:18	drumr	i cant remember exactly which game it was
2014-11-24 06:35:27	neffo	september 95
2014-11-24 06:35:30	neffo	my mistake
2014-11-24 06:35:35	drumr	it was under a killing moon or command and conquer i think
2014-11-24 06:36:15	drumr	sgi and microsoft tried to combine the two
2014-11-24 06:36:19	drumr	but it didnt go so well

2014-11-24 06:37:03	drumr	i have an original
2014-11-24 06:37:07	flesk_	UaKM was the first FMV game I think?
2014-11-24 06:37:12	drumr	under a killing moon can be run under linux
2014-11-24 06:37:21	flesk_	I think I might have originals of both too.
2014-11-24 06:37:33	drumr	no it wasnt the first
2014-11-24 06:37:41	flesk_	UaKM was on 4 CDs if I remember correctly.
2014-11-24 06:37:47	drumr	it was the first that used a lot of it
2014-11-24 06:37:51	drumr	correct
2014-11-24 06:38:01	flesk_	Hmm. Was it Phantasmagoria then?
2014-11-24 06:38:11	drumr	i think that was after
2014-11-24 06:38:17	flesk_	Oh, right.
2014-11-24 06:38:28	drumr	laserdisc
2014-11-24 06:38:29	flesk_	Wikipedia probably has the answer.
2014-11-24 06:38:32	drumr	was first fmv i think
2014-11-24 06:38:40	drumr	dragons lair
2014-11-24 06:38:47	drumr	which was 10 years before
2014-11-24 06:39:09	flesk_	Dragon's Lair? I don't recall there being FMV in the version I played.
2014-11-24 06:39:20	drumr	it kinda died out but with multimedia pcs it came back again
2014-11-24 06:39:37	drumr	dragons lair was fmv in terms of animation
2014-11-24 06:39:45	flesk_	Oh, ok.
2014-11-24 06:39:47	drumr	it still used video
2014-11-24 06:39:59	drumr	in fact there were some laserdisc arcade machines
2014-11-24 06:40:46	drumr	night trap and 7th guest came before uakm
2014-11-24 06:42:27	flesk_	Yeah, I did actually play 7th Guest. Only had very short animated sequences as far as I recall.
2014-11-24 06:42:34	drumr	yeah
2014-11-24 06:42:47	drumr	i picked up an original a couple years ago
2014-11-24 06:42:52	flesk_	I don't think I ever completed it.
2014-11-24 06:42:57	drumr	i was also foollowing the kickstarter campaign for a 3rd version
2014-11-24 06:43:26	drumr	hmmm msft announced dirextx 12 to somewhat compete with amd mantle
2014-11-24 06:43:34	drumr	in terms of driver efficiency
2014-11-24 06:43:47	drumr	anyway i remember playing some opengl stuff back in the day
2014-11-24 06:44:43	drumr	there is much to be excited about linux gaming in the future
2014-11-24 06:44:44	flesk_	I didn't end up backing that one.
2014-11-24 06:44:58	drumr	i did
2014-11-24 06:45:00	drumr	my first
2014-11-24 06:45:12	drumr	itll get made eventually
2014-11-24 06:45:18	flesk_	Nice.
2014-11-24 06:45:24	drumr	i was glad to see the first two get ported to linux and mobile
2014-11-24 06:45:55	drumr	what you see is a nostalgia wave going on which is great for linux gaming
2014-11-24 06:46:10	flesk_	Yeah.
2014-11-24 06:46:14	drumr	there is so much more compatible in the old games that are better from a story standpoint
2014-11-24 06:46:29	drumr	it is lacking on the graphics but i think that is ok
2014-11-24 06:46:29	flesk_	Kickstarter is a great way to get more games for Linux too.
2014-11-24 06:46:32	drumr	yup
2014-11-24 06:46:57	drumr	my friend and i have atsrated a company where we will be making games that have to run on linux
2014-11-24 06:47:03	drumr	that was one thing i said
2014-11-24 06:47:09	drumr	i wanted to happen
2014-11-24 06:47:39	drumr	the hard part is there are so many games being thrown together by people
2014-11-24 06:47:43	flesk_	Yeah? That's cool. Are you working on any games now?
2014-11-24 06:48:02	flesk_	Yeah, it's not easy to make a living off games as an indie developer.
2014-11-24 06:48:04	drumr	there is some originality but some ports or same mechanics different story
2014-11-24 06:48:22	drumr	yeah we have ideas for about 8 titles
2014-11-24 06:48:37	drumr	but working on one right now but its taken on a life of its own
2014-11-24 06:48:47	flesk_	What kind of genres?
2014-11-24 06:48:48	drumr	its gotten bigger than we expected
2014-11-24 06:48:57	drumr	well we want to do some adventure
2014-11-24 06:49:03	drumr	but also some hybrid stuff
2014-11-24 06:49:04	flesk_	Are you considering Kickstarter?
2014-11-24 06:49:07	drumr	i cant talk too much
2014-11-24 06:49:12	drumr	yeah we are actually
2014-11-24 06:49:20	flesk_	Sure, that's ok. :)
2014-11-24 06:49:22	drumr	but we arent ready for it yet
2014-11-24 06:49:32	flesk_	Let us know when you launch your Kickstarter campaign though. ;)
2014-11-24 06:49:45	drumr	we are trying to play around with what we want to show. screenshots versus a demo reel of some sorts
2014-11-24 06:50:02	flesk_	Having a demo is probably a good idea.
2014-11-24 06:50:05	drumr	ive been looking at some other campaigns in the past to figure it out
2014-11-24 06:50:19	flesk_	Not too many campaigns have, but I think it's a huge plus for those who do.
2014-11-24 06:50:28	drumr	yeah the problem with a demo reel is you have to create different parts of the game
2014-11-24 06:50:37	drumr	and finish it to a certain point
2014-11-24 06:50:40	flesk_	Especially when you don't have huge name in the business.
2014-11-24 06:50:44	drumr	true
2014-11-24 06:51:10	drumr	i just wish i would have done this 14 years ago instead of going into architecture
2014-11-24 06:51:39	flesk_	Alternatively videos of gameplay are great too.
2014-11-24 06:51:48	drumr	yeah
2014-11-24 06:51:53	drumr	there are many pitfalls to avoid
2014-11-24 06:52:10	drumr	one of the worst things happening in games right now is the wide release of alpha or beta releases
2014-11-24 06:52:15	drumr	as i saw someone mentioning earlier
2014-11-24 06:52:57	drumr	they have blurred the lines between market research and presales
2014-11-24 06:53:11	drumr	which i think is a dangerous precident
2014-11-24 06:53:20	drumr	its been a disaster for some
2014-11-24 06:53:39	drumr	there is so much bad going on with gaming

2014-11-24 10:20:57	Happy-Ferret	gkeen_: Not like AROS. AROS requires people to write drivers from scratch.
2014-11-24 10:20:57	gkeen_	only amiga classic things
2014-11-24 10:21:12	gkeen_	Happy-Ferret: not if you run aros on a linux kernel
2014-11-24 10:21:55	Happy-Ferret	gkeen_: Yea. If you're running AROS hosted. But that's considerably less performant than a native OS. It's basically running within a VM.
2014-11-24 10:21:57	gkeen_	also there is "official" Amithlon which boots into an emulated environment from which you can even modprobe drivers to the outside OS :P
2014-11-24 10:22:17	Happy-Ferret	gkeen_ Amithlon is based on an almost a decade old kernel.
2014-11-24 10:22:28	gkeen_	i know, but still
2014-11-24 10:23:03	gkeen_	it would be useless since most amiga apps are PPC
2014-11-24 10:23:10	Happy-Ferret	What we're trying to do is rather similar to Amithlon. Just with a modern kernel and chipset emulation for classic apps
2014-11-24 10:25:42	gkeen_	Happy-Ferret: when i said aros i meant the aeros-os project, which i havent tried

2014-11-24 12:41:23	netnomad	And #ubuntu seems like an animal house.
2014-11-24 12:41:55	liamdawe	well believe or not, but i consider myself a noob, so you're right at home
2014-11-24 12:41:59	tadzik	netnomad: I'd go for some local one
2014-11-24 12:42:07	tadzik	your city's LUG or whatever
2014-11-24 12:42:42	liamdawe	lug = linux user group
2014-11-24 12:42:50	jasonm	or just read on google about it ;)
2014-11-24 12:43:11	liamdawe	or bug DrMcCoy, he loves helping noobs
2014-11-24 12:43:16	jasonm	ha!
2014-11-24 12:43:17	liamdawe	;)
2014-11-24 12:43:25	jasonm	he sure does

2014-11-24 12:43:48	liamdawe	if this was a newspaper, we would have a "ask DrMcCoy section" :P
2014-11-24 12:43:59	DrMcCoy	lol
2014-11-24 12:44:19	jasonm	I would get his cell so in case you have a late night issue you can reach him
2014-11-24 12:44:21	jasonm	too
2014-11-24 12:44:32	liamdawe	oh hello ladybird on my wall, you and your million mates aren't welcome
2014-11-24 12:44:59	DrMcCoy	I'm sure I'd actually enjoy an "ask DrMcCoy" sections. The readers might too. The people who ask...not so much
2014-11-24 12:45:25	liamdawe	haaaah
2014-11-24 12:45:35	netnomad	Linux User's Group. Allow me to laugh.  lol.
2014-11-24 12:45:36	liamdawe	a comedy section for us more like to read your answers :P
2014-11-24 12:46:02	netnomad	WHATTYA KNOW.  There is one!
2014-11-24 12:46:02	DrMcCoy	Alternatively, you could add "Please feed DrMcCoy noobs" to the /topic
2014-11-24 12:46:42	liamdawe	haaah
2014-11-24 12:47:10	DrMcCoy	netnomad: But seriously, going to an RL meeting of a local LUG might be very useful. Depending on the people in said local LUG

2014-11-24 12:54:54	netnomad	I actually found a user's group that is local to me.  I was shocked.
2014-11-24 12:55:09	DrMcCoy	:)
2014-11-24 12:55:22	 *	netnomad spent three days in hand-to-hand combat with Ubuntu trying to change an application icon.  Finally did it, but...
2014-11-24 12:55:38	jasonm	really?
2014-11-24 12:55:54	netnomad	yeah.  It wouldn't stick.  I finally found a third-party solution that did the dirty work for me.
2014-11-24 12:56:07	jasonm	hurmmm
2014-11-24 12:56:23	netnomad	A little gnome app called mainmenu did all the dirty work for me.
2014-11-24 12:56:50	DrMcCoy	see, i couldn't help there. i don't have desktop icon. i start everything from xterm
2014-11-24 12:57:03	netnomad	I understand.  :)
2014-11-24 12:57:06	jasonm	DrMcCoy: you're such a hax0r
2014-11-24 12:57:13	netnomad	Nah, he's just geriatric like me.  :)
2014-11-24 12:57:23	jasonm	netnomad: their may be a location for this in your home directory I don't know
2014-11-24 12:57:27	jasonm	but in /usr/share/applications
2014-11-24 12:57:38	jasonm	that is where all your apps and icon associations are
2014-11-24 12:57:40	@liamdawe	DrMcCoy's tip of tje day, do everything from xterm
2014-11-24 12:57:48	netnomad	jasonm: That's where I went.  And I changed it, but it wouldn't save.  Even with sudo.
2014-11-24 12:57:59	DrMcCoy	liamdawe: yes!
2014-11-24 12:58:01	jasonm	for file in `ls /bin/`

2014-11-24 12:58:15	DrMcCoy	...
2014-11-24 12:58:17	jasonm	netnomad: it would with sudo ;)
2014-11-24 12:58:22	jasonm	must have had something else wrong
2014-11-24 12:58:29	netnomad	I think Ubuntu just hates me.
2014-11-24 12:58:57	jasonm	I have added quite a few apps to the "lens/menu" that way
2014-11-24 12:59:04	jasonm	what was the error?
2014-11-24 12:59:54	netnomad	There was no error.  It just wouldn't commit.
2014-11-24 13:00:05	jasonm	what where you writing the file with?  ;)
2014-11-24 13:00:16	jasonm	I may be able to help you figure out why if you want
2014-11-24 13:00:20	jasonm	if not, no worries too

2014-11-24 13:01:04	netnomad	I was right-clicking the icon in /usr/share/applications and going to Properties and clicking on the icon to change it.  Like a dozen websites tell me to do.  Sometimes it wouldn't even recognize the icon I had saved on the desktop.  Other times (with meddling) it would see the icon and accept it, but it wouldn't change.
2014-11-24 13:01:14	jasonm	ahhh
2014-11-24 13:01:14	netnomad	It's fixed.  That's all I care.
2014-11-24 13:01:18	jasonm	I'm with DrMcCoy there

2014-11-24 13:01:46	jasonm	yah, vim is the only way to go
2014-11-24 13:01:54	netnomad	I ain't there yet.  I was a QNX user back in the 80's, but... still most comfortable in the desktop environment.  For now.
2014-11-24 13:01:58	drumr	doesnt amiga progs run on ppc
2014-11-24 13:02:07	drumr	sorry i am commenting on chat earlier
2014-11-24 13:02:56	netnomad	The root (pun not intended) of the problem was I <3 Epiphany but I absolutely detest the icon.  Every time I'd look at the icon on-screen I'd think the mouse was already there.  It had to be changed.  lol.
2014-11-24 13:03:15	netnomad	To ANYTHING.
2014-11-24 13:03:17	jasonm	ha
2014-11-24 13:03:20	jasonm	copy that
2014-11-24 13:03:20	drumr	i still chuckled
2014-11-24 13:04:54	netnomad	So I stuck a Netscape icon in it's place.  In memory of a deceased friend.  ;)
2014-11-24 13:05:10	drumr	Net Scape
2014-11-24 13:05:30	drumr	i like to refer it to netscrape

2014-11-24 13:05:50	 *	netnomad nods -- but the icon did it's duty.  It stopped me from having an aneurysm.
2014-11-24 13:06:10	drumr	i think it was a cool icnon at the time even in 256 color

2014-11-24 19:35:30	Christopher-Were	The only time I find a need flash is when livestreaming. I have an addon which turns it off when I'm not doing that
2014-11-24 19:36:48	drumr	when i use ice weasel itll play youtube videos but then ill get an error about needing to install flash

2014-11-24 19:40:15	Christopher-Were	I find an add-on called flashdisable quite good for switching between Flash and HTML5 players as necesery and one called All YouTube HTML5 for making all YT video compatable with the HTML5 player.
2014-11-24 19:41:00	Christopher-Were	The PPA worked flawlessly for me. No source code or compiling necessery

2014-12-01 01:23:30	NuSuey	DocPoe: don't do it .. NOOOOOOOOOOO .. ah, dude, come on.. I have a winshit partiton.. there is stuff I can't still play on Linux and I paid for them so.. fuck it, but I my linux partition is my my main, and I work and play mostly from there
2014-12-01 01:24:35	NuSuey	but if I hadn't win installed on the HDD before, I wouldn't spend a cent for it and would just stick with linux
2014-12-01 01:24:54	DocPoe	i just can't anymore :( i miss my games, i can't use wine for them (i tried ... hours ...). linux will be my main, no doubt
2014-12-01 01:25:39	okb	If it's any salvation I've not gotten a game to run under wine either
2014-12-01 01:25:54	okb	Typically I can install them, but they al lhang during startup
2014-12-01 01:26:24	DocPoe	i don't have that much problems (using PoL for it), but my holy sport games just won't work
2014-12-01 01:26:38	okb	ah never tried PoL
2014-12-01 01:26:50	DocPoe	you should, it's great
2014-12-01 01:27:22	DocPoe	diablo 3 - no problem, hearthstone - no problem, rift - little problems, but my holy pro evo soccer just doesn't work
2014-12-01 01:27:31	NuSuey	helps that you can have various wine-prefix versions so it's easily managable
2014-12-01 01:28:08	okb	Maybe I should... But I've come to the point where I got more than enough Linux-supporting games to play that I no longer need to work around the challenge of non-Linux versions
2014-12-01 01:28:38	okb	I can understand it when you got one specific title that you just *need*.
2014-12-01 01:28:55	DocPoe	i'm a football (soccer) holic
2014-12-01 01:29:12	okb	I gotta admit that Dragon Age Inquisition is one of those titles I'm in doubt I can live without. The BioWare games is the only reason I still got a windows partition.
2014-12-01 01:29:14	DocPoe	i played FM2014 like 50hours last week
2014-12-01 01:31:45	okb	Get a PS4 for it? :)
2014-12-01 01:31:50	DocPoe	it's not only PES, it's watch dogs, skyrim (doesn't work for me under wine), port royale 3, patrician IV and so on
2014-12-01 01:32:01	DocPoe	i don't have the money for that ;)
2014-12-01 01:32:16	okb	Oh by all means, there's plenty of epic stuff not on Linux yet. Like GTA5 now in january.
2014-12-01 01:32:18	NuSuey	what I'm still finishing up is my Win partition to just autologin to Big-Screen Steam.. Linux is just my main and If I wanna play something that I can't run with wine (Bulletstorm, Tifanfall, etc) I'll reboot to that.. have a ps3 but I don't want to invest more money to consoles if I have already a library of 200-300 games on steam..
2014-12-01 01:33:13	okb	I boot into windows so rarely now that whenever I do, I have to wait like half an hour for the damn security patches to be done.

2014-12-01 05:07:41	NuSuey	gkeen_: but it works, it's playable and I'm playing it .. only thing is that you get green screen during ingame cinematics, but I with the help of some great people on wowuidev I have now created addon that cancels the videos and puts a url where you can see the video on the screen .. so..a big workaround - but works :P

2014-12-01 09:43:24	stqn	at least in France they are not paying.

2014-12-01 10:15:40	DrMcCoy	The problem is that Amazon, even in the EU, isn't directly employing those people
2014-12-01 10:16:05	DrMcCoy	They're working with a subcontractor, and those are employing the workers
2014-12-01 10:16:16	jaycee	yeah, but that wouldnt get them off here
2014-12-01 10:16:23	jaycee	amazon would still be held liable
2014-12-01 10:18:55	DrMcCoy	Don't know about Amazon, but in Germany, parcel distribution is often done like this. Most notoriously Hermes. And those workers there are quite badly off, since they're not salaried employees, but "self-employed"
2014-12-01 10:19:59	DrMcCoy	Shit pay, bad working conditions, no insurance, etc

2014-12-01 11:24:47	Segata_Sanshiro	liamdawe, sure that's the only solution I can think of. If you think of anything better, that's fine too :)
2014-12-01 11:26:06	liamdawe	i think it's a fine solution, will work, and easy to do it

2014-12-01 11:27:15	Segata_Sanshiro	also with the ordering of the results on the images, it was something I was thinking about today too... I need to think of a way of doing that because at the moment i just screengrab the images google forms spits out and that's the order they're in.

2014-12-01 11:28:23	Segata_Sanshiro	i think i can just change the order in the questions once i take the survey offline and put them in descending order... I think that will change the order in the images too.

2014-12-01 14:37:44	jaycee	for which i am glad as i fucking hate fedora ;)
2014-12-01 14:37:56	Sik	Eh, not so much for me
2014-12-01 14:38:01	Sik	Surprised that Gnome ranked that low though
2014-12-01 14:38:16	Sik	I guess Ubuntu defaulting to Unity really hurt its userbase
2014-12-01 14:38:54	Sik	(also Gnome 3 sucking horribly at first, but many of the issues are gone by now and there's still classic mode which is pretty close to Gnome 2)
2014-12-01 14:39:55	sobkas	Sik: not many people remember how ugly Gnome 2 was at beginning
2014-12-01 14:40:47	Sik	I remember people complaining about Gnome 3 not allowing to maximize windows (well, you could... but not the normal way, i.e. you had to resize each border manually)
2014-12-01 14:41:11	Sik	Now I definitely can so either they added it back or it's classic-only
2014-12-01 14:41:26	Sik	But even classic snaps to the sides, so I doubt it's classic-only
2014-12-01 14:42:02	Sik	Then again I also remember people avoiding PulseAudio like the plague, now there are still complaints but not anywhere as many as there used to be
2014-12-01 14:42:53	sobkas	I don't remember that I was unable to maximize window, double click on the window bar did the trick
2014-12-01 14:45:29	Sik	Apparently people had trouble with Gnome 3 with that in its early releases
2014-12-01 14:46:00	Sik	I guess it didn't last long :P

2014-12-04 05:31:33	DrMcCoy	ouch
2014-12-04 05:31:58	stqn	well I wouldn’t remember them anyway
2014-12-04 05:32:04	jaycee	DerRidda, we'd have preferred to just drop GL 2.1
2014-12-04 05:32:31	stqn	I guess I’ll do it for the most useful ones
2014-12-04 05:34:17	DerRidda	It's just this: On the slim chance that your next game is The Witcher 3 I just want it to run as good as humanly possible. If it won't be I might have to poop on your doormat.

2014-12-04 05:38:53	jaycee	it would be beneficial if linux people lost this attitude that wrapping d3d == bad
2014-12-04 05:39:02	tadzik	heh
2014-12-04 05:39:05	jaycee	we know valve, aspyr and feral do it, just at source code level
2014-12-04 05:39:19	jaycee	thing is, source code level is completely irrelevant
2014-12-04 05:40:59	tadzik	the next “logical” step would be "your game is not Pure enough, because it was developed on windows first!11"
2014-12-04 05:41:08	jaycee	the big problem with witcher 2's initial release was that we assumed the same shared context tricks that worked for multithreaded GL on the mac, would also work on Linux
2014-12-04 05:41:09	jaycee	they didnt
2014-12-04 05:41:41	jaycee	and cdpr let us down with testing, as they told us it was fine. on our inhouse systems, it also looked fine
2014-12-04 05:42:15	DerRidda	That#s the thing, you only have one try at a first impression.
2014-12-04 05:42:17	DrMcCoy	jaycee: I just love how you always seem to know what's best for Linux people
2014-12-04 05:42:58	-->	kevinbenko (~kevinbenk@24-116-187-0.cpe.cableone.net) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-04 05:43:27	jaycee	well we know what AAA devs expect
2014-12-04 05:45:15	DrMcCoy	Crunch time, overtime without pay, getting canned after project delivery?
2014-12-04 05:45:16	DerRidda	And costumers expect good performance. Bring the two together and you will change a lot of opinions, fail to do so and you will reinforce them.
2014-12-04 05:46:22	jaycee	DerRidda, indeed, but, it seems so far that if a game doesnt perform as well on linux as it does on windows - whether its native, wrapped, or whatever, people just assume "bad port"
2014-12-04 05:46:55	jaycee	valve have not helped by saying "linux drivers are as good as windows ones". maybe for the subset of stuff they use on Source1 they are, but otherwise, it's not true
2014-12-04 05:47:05	DerRidda	Some but a lot of people know that there are limits with OpenGL multithreading not really existing and driver quality.
2014-12-04 05:47:19	jaycee	look at DI
2014-12-04 05:47:31	jaycee	people say thats "bad port" now, why ? because it's not as fast as windows..
2014-12-04 05:47:39	jaycee	thats a native port
2014-12-04 05:47:40	DerRidda	What's with it? It actually runs super well for me.
2014-12-04 05:47:48	jaycee	shrug, runs fine for me too :)
2014-12-04 05:48:09	jaycee	if its not as good as windows its quite likely because they had to single thread their rendering
2014-12-04 05:48:10	DerRidda	Yeah, most people I know were positively surprised by that.
2014-12-04 05:48:28	jaycee	from our mac port, we know the original windows DX9 renderer uses like, 4 threads to render
2014-12-04 05:48:32	DerRidda	But the people that have issues are right in the sense that the devs have not responded to any of them at all.
2014-12-04 05:51:32	tadzik	DI?
2014-12-04 05:51:35	jaycee	my main issue was that they were dumb enough to ship unstripped ;)
2014-12-04 05:51:36	DerRidda	Dead Island
2014-12-04 05:51:37	tadzik	ah
2014-12-04 05:51:54	DerRidda	Indeed, that#s one large arse binary.
2014-12-04 05:52:07	tadzik	it ships a windows vm inside
2014-12-04 05:52:09	tadzik	/s
2014-12-04 05:52:18	jaycee	nope, it ships a fuckload of debug symbols ;)
2014-12-04 05:52:48	jaycee	run strip -g on it, and it goes down to like 40MB or so

2014-12-04 05:53:38	jaycee	our release builds build with symbols, but the post-link stage strips them out into a seperate file
2014-12-04 05:53:41	tadzik	yeah, so I've heard
2014-12-04 05:56:05	jaycee	we strip them out with objcopy into a .sym file, and then use --add-gnu-debuglink on the main binary to link it with that .sym file
2014-12-04 05:56:15	stqn	DI runs fine, the main problem is broken RNG and silence from the publisher
2014-12-04 05:56:36	jaycee	the .sym file then gets used with Google Breakpad so our crash reporter can symbolise stacktraces

2014-12-05 06:14:51	Beamboom	Funny thing is everyone assumes she's doing it for the money. And by all means, she may. But: It's not *obvious*. Maybe it just plain turns her on
2014-12-05 06:15:09	Beamboom	There are female exhibishionists too. They do exist.
2014-12-05 06:15:55	Beamboom	Had a guy been sitting there with his rod in the air, everyone would have screamed "flasher! Flasher"!

2014-12-05 06:17:45	Beamboom	There are exhibishionists everywhere. Just look at all those free amateur sex sites with user uploads. They are overloaded with people who don't earn a penny by strutting their stuff. All ages, sexes and looks.
2014-12-05 06:18:57	NuSuey	yup
2014-12-05 06:19:11	Beamboom	Hell I've even been playing with the idea of creating a site like that myself, where people can do their thing. It could generate a nice income on the side.

2014-12-05 06:20:14	Beamboom	hehe yeah there's thousands
2014-12-05 06:21:11	Beamboom	But something like "the Facebook of exhibishionists" kinda site don't exist as far as I know - at least not known enough for all to be aware of, and then there by definition is a market for a competitor

2014-12-05 07:02:35	turol	TL;DR: nvidia implemented equivalent of mantle/dx12 as opengl extension
2014-12-05 07:03:11	jaycee	oh goody, yet another vendor specific extension
2014-12-05 07:03:28	turol	also looks like kepler or even maxwell only
2014-12-05 07:03:40	turol	requires arb bindless texture so no fermi
2014-12-05 07:04:19	turol	interesting similarities to mantle in state handling
2014-12-05 07:04:50	turol	almost all state (fbo, shader, blending/depth, primitive type) as one immutable state object
2014-12-05 07:05:42	jaycee	"if I can't play it w/ the Mesa drivers I probably won't buy it..." are people really serious...
2014-12-05 07:05:54	jaycee	shrug
2014-12-05 07:05:57	-->	Raven67854 (~Raven6785@70-33-140-67.unassigned.ntelos.net) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-05 07:06:00	Morgawr	jaycee: what's wrong with that?
2014-12-05 07:06:26	jaycee	Morgawr, might as well not bother buying any AAA games on linux with that condition
2014-12-05 07:07:04	Morgawr	that's exactly what those people are saying apparently
2014-12-05 07:07:12	Morgawr	they won't buy it if it doesn't use mesa
2014-12-05 07:07:17	Morgawr	their problem I guess
2014-12-05 07:07:36	jaycee	yep. not our problem mesa isnt feature complete and/or performant enough when binary drivers are
2014-12-05 07:08:05	turol	say, has anyone tried insanely twisted shadow planet with mesa drivers?
2014-12-05 07:08:22	@Samsai	on amd side of things mesa performance when compared to catalyst isn't that bad
2014-12-05 07:08:31	turol	because one of those shaders had an interesting rgb -> hsv -> rgb effect
2014-12-05 07:08:49	turol	and some nvidia drivers(!) miscompiled the early versions
2014-12-05 07:08:52	@Samsai	of course feature completeness is still a thing to improve
2014-12-05 07:09:03	turol	i'd like to know if mesa survives the current one
2014-12-05 07:09:46	Raven67854	turol, I tried it on the bleeding edge mesa
2014-12-05 07:10:05	turol	Raven67854: did you enter the multiplayer lobby?
2014-12-05 07:10:14	turol	that's where it's easily visible
2014-12-05 07:10:32	turol	default ship should be blue and nicely shaded
2014-12-05 07:10:37	Raven67854	turol, no
2014-12-05 07:10:44	turol	if it's something else (like cyan) and "dirty" then it's wrong
2014-12-05 07:10:48	Morgawr	jaycee: sounds like developers and/or companies should put more effort into open source mesa drivers then, if that's what their customer are asking for
2014-12-05 07:10:52	turol	the shader is really "interesting"
2014-12-05 07:11:00	turol	the original HLSL used multiple nested ifs
2014-12-05 07:11:11	Raven67854	Morgawr, Linux doesn't have enough market to justify such an expense
2014-12-05 07:11:15	turol	and then ms shader compiler turned that into a bunch on conditional moves
2014-12-05 07:11:17	jaycee	^
2014-12-05 07:11:26	jaycee	Valve are an exception
2014-12-05 07:11:30	Morgawr	Raven67854: I'm not saying it's justified or not
2014-12-05 07:11:35	turol	it then went through mojoshader and the gl driver
2014-12-05 07:11:50	turol	and depending on optimization levels it broke on some drivers
2014-12-05 07:12:03	Raven67854	foss drivers improve rapidly and are catching up to catalyst. Biggest hurdle atm is GL4
2014-12-05 07:14:18	jaycee	theyre only catching up to catalyst if youre talking pre-GCN hardware
2014-12-05 07:14:27	jaycee	for the 7xxx and later, radeonsi is crap
2014-12-05 07:14:52	Raven67854	I've had good luck with my r290x. It's improving quite well
2014-12-05 07:15:01	Morgawr	all these companies would have a much easier time if they just worked all together on mesa drivers for their cards
2014-12-05 07:15:05	Raven67854	7 series and below are way better supported
2014-12-05 07:15:14	Morgawr	but alas, licensing issues, trade secrets, yadda yadda
2014-12-05 07:15:15	Raven67854	Morgawr, No they really wouldn't
2014-12-05 07:15:25	Morgawr	Raven67854: in the long run they would
2014-12-05 07:15:30	Raven67854	No not really
2014-12-05 07:15:31	jaycee	nvidia are fine apart from the constant attempts to sabotage them
2014-12-05 07:15:36	Morgawr	Raven67854: how so
2014-12-05 07:16:12	Raven67854	Morgawr, Does Aspyr for example have experianced developers on hand that are experianced at making GPU drivers?
2014-12-05 07:16:24	Raven67854	I doubt they do
2014-12-05 07:16:39	Morgawr	I'm not talking about developers from those companies
2014-12-05 07:16:41	Morgawr	I'm talking about vendors
2014-12-05 07:16:46	Morgawr	like AMD, nVidia, etc etc
2014-12-05 07:16:50	Raven67854	AMD already does that :P
2014-12-05 07:16:52	-->	psymin (~psymin@ali.hydeco.com) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-05 07:16:56	Raven67854	so does Intel
2014-12-05 07:17:10	Morgawr	I know about Intel, I don't know about AMD (I'm not big into that so I honestly have no idea)
2014-12-05 07:17:16	Morgawr	doesn't AMD have their own proprietary drivers?
2014-12-05 07:17:25	Raven67854	Yes but those drivers suck
2014-12-05 07:17:34	Morgawr	I know that much :P
2014-12-05 07:17:36	Raven67854	Even if they get better performance. They crash awfully bad
2014-12-05 07:18:35	Morgawr	so is AMD concurrently working on both stacks? open source and proprietary drivers?
2014-12-05 07:18:55	Raven67854	Yes
2014-12-05 07:19:08	<--	jhw (~jhw@unaffiliated/jhw) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2014-12-05 07:19:10	Raven67854	I don't think they have many dedicated to the open source drivers
2014-12-05 07:19:12	jaycee	AMD are only turning to mesa now because theyre fucked otherwise
2014-12-05 07:19:19	Morgawr	^ rightfully so :D
2014-12-05 07:19:29	Raven67854	AMD hasn't ever really had good drivers
2014-12-05 07:19:31	Morgawr	now we just need nvidia as well to jump over, I guess
2014-12-05 07:19:32	Raven67854	Even on windows a pile of issues
2014-12-05 07:19:36	Raven67854	and I blame catalyst
2014-12-05 07:19:38	jaycee	nvidia wont jump
2014-12-05 07:19:43	Morgawr	says who
2014-12-05 07:19:48	Raven67854	Morgawr, So long as Nvidia keeps producing excellent drivers
2014-12-05 07:19:53	Raven67854	Who cares if the drivers are foss
2014-12-05 07:19:55	jaycee	Raven67854, there is no shared code between catalyst on windows and any other platform
2014-12-05 07:20:09	Raven67854	jaycee, Yes and yet catalyst is still complete shit on any platform it's dumped on
2014-12-05 07:20:18	Morgawr	it's not about foss (although that's a huge plus), it's more about industry-level collaboration and more streamlined process across all hardware
2014-12-05 07:20:22	Morgawr	I guess I'm a dreamer
2014-12-05 07:20:44	jaycee	nvidia dont need to do anything different from what theyre doing. they have an excellent driver core they use across platforms
2014-12-05 07:21:01	jaycee	what needs to happen there, is the LKML lot need to grow up and stop deliberately sabotaging nvidia every chance they get
2014-12-05 07:21:32	<--	levifig (~levi@hakr.io) has quit (Quit: Farewell)
2014-12-05 07:21:35	Morgawr	jaycee: I'd say the LKML has more interest in nvidia jumping over just like everyone else is doing instead of locking in people to their own proprietary drivers (no matter how good they are)
2014-12-05 07:21:52	jaycee	nobody except a few beardies cares
2014-12-05 07:22:02	jaycee	we care that their drivers work and are performant
2014-12-05 07:22:03	Raven67854	Morgawr, you still have foss drivers so you aren't locked in
2014-12-05 07:22:14	Morgawr	oh really, that's pretty idiotic talk considering "nobody except a few beardies cares about gaming on linux" and yet here we are
2014-12-05 07:22:20	Morgawr	I find that statement very irrelevant and immature
2014-12-05 07:22:36	Raven67854	Morgawr, It's an easy cop out for a lot of things
2014-12-05 07:23:03	Morgawr	Raven67854: I know
2014-12-05 07:23:30	Morgawr	I can see why it makes sense to keep doing what they keep doing atm, it's easy, it works and it gives them money
2014-12-05 07:23:35	-->	levifig (uid1908@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-kxemmnauzjnponbv) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-05 07:24:01	Morgawr	but as a customer and linux user I'd rather see it move the other way, and as a company it's not even that stupid of a move to make if you think about investing in the long run, rather than the next 2-3 years
2014-12-05 07:24:09	Morgawr	but that's not how it works "in the real world" of companies, I guess
2014-12-05 07:24:19	turol	nvidia has better drivers than anyone
2014-12-05 07:24:21	Raven67854	Still no actual advantage to fossing the drivers
2014-12-05 07:24:26	Morgawr	turol: for the moment
2014-12-05 07:24:29	turol	nvidia and mad hardware is roughly equivalent
2014-12-05 07:24:34	turol	intel is far behind
2014-12-05 07:24:40	Morgawr	Raven67854: the advantage is that you can work on a stable and shared codebase between all driver and hardware vendors
2014-12-05 07:24:48	turol	if nvidia went oss it would take years to get where their current driver is
2014-12-05 07:24:58	turol	and it would also eliminate their driver advantage over amd
2014-12-05 07:25:04	turol	so it makes no sense for them to go oss
2014-12-05 07:25:12	Morgawr	and we get fucked in the ass because of that
2014-12-05 07:25:19	Raven67854	the foss nvidia drivers are not so bad now that reclocking is working
2014-12-05 07:25:28	Raven67854	They actually perform near the amd drivers
2014-12-05 07:25:44	Raven67854	Buggy though
2014-12-05 07:25:45	jaycee	no you get fucked in the ass because some lamers working on kernel decide "haha, lets break nvidia's blob again today because we can"
2014-12-05 07:25:48	turol	but they're FAR behind nvidia proprietary driver
2014-12-05 07:25:58	turol	no GL4, no bindless, no AZDO...
2014-12-05 07:26:04	turol	which are the things nvidia is pushing
2014-12-05 07:26:09	Raven67854	turol, Well one would assume if they went foss they would open up entirely. And move code around.
2014-12-05 07:26:21	turol	forget your oss advocacy and consider nvidia's viewpoint
2014-12-05 07:26:23	Raven67854	So it wouldn't take that long to catch up
2014-12-05 07:26:30	turol	they're a rational (but selfish) actor
2014-12-05 07:26:40	Morgawr	jaycee: you're blaming people work on free source technologies for "breaking" stuff that is proprietary, infects the projects they are working on, and they have no way to know about because it's all closed source and nvidia is actively working against them to push their own interests
2014-12-05 07:26:46	Raven67854	Nvidia has a lot of money riding on Linux as well
2014-12-05 07:26:58	Morgawr	I find blaming kernel developers because of it to be a rather childish statement
2014-12-05 07:27:13	Raven67854	Morgawr, Actually ignoring his neckbeard comment. He isn't wrong on that
2014-12-05 07:27:18	Raven67854	It's why optimus isn't done yet
2014-12-05 07:27:25	jaycee	Morgawr, tell me how it is that both windows and osx can have binary driver modules without requiring recompilation every time the kernel changes
2014-12-05 07:27:39	jaycee	wait, i'll tell you how, its because these two OS's have defined a STABLE ABI for it
2014-12-05 07:27:42	turol	the kernel devs don't want some closed-source piece of crap messing with core kernel memory management
2014-12-05 07:27:47	turol	it's hard enough as it is
2014-12-05 07:27:59	jaycee	no, the kernel devs dont want anything closed full stop. they could do something about it. they wont.
2014-12-05 07:28:00	Morgawr	jaycee: feel free to go work on the linux kernel and fix those issues, don't ask me I'm not a kernel developer
2014-12-05 07:28:12	jaycee	theyd rather stick to their ideals and screw everyone in the process
2014-12-05 07:28:15	Morgawr	I'm all for supporting them NOT WANTING closed source software on their kernel
2014-12-05 07:28:22	Morgawr	if you want that shit, go use windows or OSX
2014-12-05 07:28:27	jaycee	Morgawr, then you can live without decent hardware support
2014-12-05 07:28:37	Raven67854	I have decent hardware support
2014-12-05 07:28:45	Raven67854	I have really good hardware support actually :P
2014-12-05 07:29:02	jaycee	Raven67854, yep cause youre not against using nvidias driver :)
2014-12-05 07:29:03	Morgawr	you do realize those "ideals" are what makes Linux such a great environment and is used by thousands upon thousands of companies in various fields across the industry, right? because it is free and open sourec
2014-12-05 07:29:07	Morgawr	source*
2014-12-05 07:29:11	Morgawr	you want proprietary? have fun with windows
2014-12-05 07:29:15	Raven67854	jaycee, irrelivent
2014-12-05 07:29:36	Raven67854	Morgawr, Nvidia gives back to Linux a fair bit at least
2014-12-05 07:29:40	Morgawr	Raven67854: sure
2014-12-05 07:29:44	Raven67854	So give them some credit
2014-12-05 07:29:52	Raven67854	all of the Nvidia powered supercomputers are on Linux
2014-12-05 07:30:01	Raven67854	and the 2 new ones Nvidia is building will be
2014-12-05 07:30:12	Raven67854	Nvidia/IBM
2014-12-05 07:30:33	Morgawr	I just find it irrational for kernel developers and the whole history of the linux kernel to give up their entire ideology because during 2-3 years of slight gaming on linux people start to complain that they want binary proprietary drivers
2014-12-05 07:30:35	Raven67854	That is probably the only reason the Linux drivers are so good actually
2014-12-05 07:30:39	jaycee	right, and i bet noone using those cares that the driver is binary :)
2014-12-05 07:31:00	Raven67854	The supercomputers have to work at max efficiency
2014-12-05 07:31:47	Raven67854	jaycee, well some of us want fully foss, others are okay with a mixture. I don't want any closed anything in the kernel. But I do agree that they could at least work with Nvidia on an agreeable solution
2014-12-05 07:31:53	Raven67854	rather than being shitheads about it
2014-12-05 07:32:13	Morgawr	jaycee: I find it amazing how you can claim that "no one cares" on your own, as if you were speaking for the whole linux community
2014-12-05 07:33:36	jaycee	Raven67854, all the linux kernel devs have to do is provide an agreed interface. nvidia even try to accomodate that with the kernel shim
2014-12-05 07:33:55	jaycee	the kernel devs simply dont want to, theyd rather try to "force" nvidia to open source
2014-12-05 07:34:00	jaycee	theyve even admitted it
2014-12-05 07:34:09	Morgawr	jaycee: you should post that on the linuk kernel mailing list
2014-12-05 07:34:14	Morgawr	I'm interested to see what they have to say
2014-12-05 07:34:18	Raven67854	Morgawr, It's been talked about several times
2014-12-05 07:34:19	jaycee	im not
2014-12-05 07:34:25	Morgawr	Raven67854: I'm sure it is
2014-12-05 07:34:27	Raven67854	Morgawr, jaycee despite his way of saying it
2014-12-05 07:34:28	jaycee	i know what their opinion is
2014-12-05 07:34:29	Raven67854	Isn't false
2014-12-05 07:34:34	Morgawr	I'm not refuting his claims
2014-12-05 07:34:43	Morgawr	I'm just saying that complaining about it here over and over again isn't really helpful or anything
2014-12-05 07:34:43	jaycee	"nvidia are lame, nvidia should do what we want them to do, nvidia are lame, waa waa waa"
2014-12-05 07:34:44	Raven67854	kernel team is assholes sometimes
2014-12-05 07:35:02	Raven67854	But as it doesn't affect me in anyway I'm fine with it
2014-12-05 07:35:08	Raven67854	Nvidia will still be here 10 years from now
2014-12-05 07:35:10	Raven67854	So all is well
2014-12-05 07:35:29	Raven67854	Nvidia has way to much money riding on Linux to just stop.
2014-12-05 07:35:35	jaycee	provided nvidia dont get thoroughly pissed off with it all and say "right, fuck you Linux, no publically available driver now"
2014-12-05 07:35:43	Morgawr	Raven67854: they can be assholes but from all I've seen in the past, Linux kernel developers have often had good reasons for rejecting what they reject
2014-12-05 07:35:44	Raven67854	Nah that won't happen
2014-12-05 07:35:55	Morgawr	jaycee: as if, lol
2014-12-05 07:35:55	jaycee	Raven67854, they could easily just provide the driver to vendors who want it... as SoC makers already do
2014-12-05 07:35:57	Raven67854	Morgawr, Yeah but they flatout won't work with nvidia
2014-12-05 07:36:08	Raven67854	Like anything
2014-12-05 07:36:09	Morgawr	Raven67854: I don't know that, honestly, I haven't looked into it. It feels weird to me but okay
2014-12-05 07:36:16	Raven67854	No go read the mailing lists
2014-12-05 07:36:19	Raven67854	Sometimes they just won't
2014-12-05 07:36:20	Morgawr	last I heard, kernel devs were actually claiming that nvidia wasn't working with them
2014-12-05 07:36:24	Morgawr	so I don't know
2014-12-05 07:36:30	Morgawr	(that was in 2012 or whatever)
2014-12-05 07:36:35	jaycee	the linux kernel devs are lying then
2014-12-05 07:36:39	Raven67854	Because Nvidia wouldn't go open
2014-12-05 07:36:39	Morgawr	:)
2014-12-05 07:36:50	Morgawr	Raven67854: sounds like nVidia should go open then
2014-12-05 07:36:55	Morgawr	like intel and AMD apparently did
2014-12-05 07:37:00	NuSuey	gkeen_: you have?
2014-12-05 07:37:00	Raven67854	Morgawr, AMD hasn't gone open either
2014-12-05 07:37:08	jaycee	they flat out said "we're not allowing nvidia to use <x kernel feature>"
2014-12-05 07:37:10	Raven67854	A lot of AMD is still closed
2014-12-05 07:37:11	jaycee	i forget what feature it was
2014-12-05 07:37:18	Morgawr	Raven67854: you said they have a team working on mesa, didn't you?
2014-12-05 07:37:27	Morgawr	jaycee: got a link to that? sounds interesting
2014-12-05 07:37:29	jaycee	Morgawr, AMD havent gone open. theyve released a load of specs for now obsolete hardware, thats it
2014-12-05 07:37:40	<--	levifig (uid1908@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-kxemmnauzjnponbv) has quit
2014-12-05 07:37:48	@Samsai	and they employ people who work on the open source drivers, or at least did
2014-12-05 07:37:49	turol	jaycee: they're planning to with their unified kernel driver
2014-12-05 07:37:49	Raven67854	Morgawr, The people working on mesa still aren't bringing AMD code over from the prop driver
2014-12-05 07:38:08	Raven67854	turol, I'm still very meh on that
2014-12-05 07:38:16	Morgawr	Raven67854: it's still something
2014-12-05 07:38:17	Raven67854	Since it basically kills anybody whose not on GCN hardware
2014-12-05 07:38:21	jaycee	turol, yes, because they have realised they are fucked on catalyst, thats it
2014-12-05 07:38:22	turol	and the kernel maintainers don't want proprietary code to touch core memory management interfaces
2014-12-05 07:38:28	turol	because they're in flux
2014-12-05 07:38:36	turol	with scalability patches etc
2014-12-05 07:38:37	-->	levifig (~levi@hakr.io) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-05 07:38:40	Morgawr	I'm all for supporting that, I don't understand why people are so surprised at it
2014-12-05 07:38:43	turol	nvidia wanted buffer sharing
2014-12-05 07:38:46	turol	and kernel devs said no
2014-12-05 07:38:50	Raven67854	Morgawr, Should actually read on the AMD open source drivers
2014-12-05 07:39:02	Raven67854	It doesn't sound as nice they make it out ot be
2014-12-05 07:40:04	Morgawr	I'm fairly sure there's a lot of PR and politicizing from all sides so yeah, it's definitely not as simple and straightforward as we're making it seem
2014-12-05 07:40:17	Morgawr	I trust the kernel devs much more than random nvidia people, honestly
2014-12-05 07:40:17	Raven67854	AMD just realizes how fucked it is
2014-12-05 07:40:30	Raven67854	Morgawr, Things will be fine..
2014-12-05 07:40:36	Raven67854	Nvidia will keep making great drivers
2014-12-05 07:40:42	Raven67854	kernel team will keep being themselves
2014-12-05 07:40:46	jaycee	after http://www.wired.com/2012/06/torvalds-nvidia-linux/ if i'd been nvidia, i'd have either a) sued him or b) pulled the driver for a month

2014-12-05 07:41:00	Raven67854	jaycee, you can't sue someone for giving you the middle finger
2014-12-05 07:41:02	Morgawr	who gives a shit about his behavior
2014-12-05 07:41:09	Morgawr	are we talking about feelings or objective reasons?
2014-12-05 07:41:11	Raven67854	If we could sue assholes both me and you would be sued already :P
2014-12-05 07:41:31	Morgawr	honestly, people need to stop being offended for that stuff
2014-12-05 07:41:49	Raven67854	Morgawr, It was still very inappriopriate and immature
2014-12-05 07:41:53	Raven67854	And wow that spelling
2014-12-05 07:42:15	Raven67854	Morgawr, there was no need for it
2014-12-05 07:42:25	@Samsai	linus just being linus
2014-12-05 07:42:29	jaycee	http://beta.slashdot.org/story/176213 thats the feature i was thinking of

2014-12-05 07:42:42	Raven67854	ugh slashdot
2014-12-05 07:42:56	jaycee	well, phoronix has it too and others
2014-12-05 07:43:12	jaycee	that was just my first google hit
2014-12-05 07:43:13	Morgawr	"inappropriate" for what? he has all the right to say that, I honestly wouldn't give a single fuck about it. I'd rather focus on the technical merits (or de-merits) of what he has to say instead of raising a politically correctness uproar over some inconsequential tiny detail like "omg he used the F word"
2014-12-05 07:43:21	jaycee	but it shows the kernel developers mentality
2014-12-05 07:43:29	Raven67854	Morgawr, Then you can't call jaycee immature/childish for calling people like us neckbeards
2014-12-05 07:43:32	Morgawr	sure
2014-12-05 07:43:34	jaycee	they deliberately set out to make the feature nvidia need, and then forbid them using it
2014-12-05 07:43:44	Morgawr	I can call him like that, but I still won't dismiss what he has to say
2014-12-05 07:43:52	Morgawr	otherwise I'd have left the conversation back then :P
2014-12-05 07:43:54	Raven67854	Linus represents Linux
2014-12-05 07:44:00	Morgawr	does he?
2014-12-05 07:44:00	Raven67854	He shouldn't act that way
2014-12-05 07:44:04	Morgawr	since when?
2014-12-05 07:44:09	Raven67854	He's the father of linux
2014-12-05 07:44:11	Morgawr	and?
2014-12-05 07:44:12	Raven67854	I'd say since forever
2014-12-05 07:44:16	@Samsai	management by perkele, look it up
2014-12-05 07:44:26	Morgawr	I thought it was called the Linux Foundation, not the Linus Torvalds Foundation
2014-12-05 07:44:33	@Samsai	that's how linux development has been handled and probably will be handled
2014-12-05 07:44:35	Morgawr	people just need to stop being butthurt
2014-12-05 07:44:37	Raven67854	Morgawr, He carries a lot of sway from his presense
2014-12-05 07:44:44	Morgawr	and he uses it smartly
2014-12-05 07:44:47	Raven67854	Not relaly
2014-12-05 07:44:51	Raven67854	That didn't get him anywhere
2014-12-05 07:44:53	Morgawr	he raised a lot of awareness towards nVidia's assholeish behavior
2014-12-05 07:45:03	Raven67854	What assholeish behavior?
2014-12-05 07:45:04	Morgawr	that specifically got him somewhere
2014-12-05 07:45:13	jaycee	all i know is, im pissed off when i cant upgrade xorg without risking the driver breaking. exactly what oibaf did last night
2014-12-05 07:45:21	Morgawr	well from what he claim, nvidia wasn't willing to work nicely on their open source enviornment
2014-12-05 07:45:22	jaycee	deliberately broke nvidia's glx module
2014-12-05 07:45:26	Morgawr	which is the entire reason why he did that stunt
2014-12-05 07:45:37	Morgawr	I don't know the details, but I'm pretty sure Mr. Torvalds does :)
2014-12-05 07:45:39	jaycee	nvidia *dont want to open source their driver*
2014-12-05 07:45:41	jaycee	thats it
2014-12-05 07:45:41	Raven67854	Morgawr, Nothing changed it got him nowhere. Just made him look silly
2014-12-05 07:46:01	@Samsai	well, nvidia did release stuff after that
2014-12-05 07:46:02	jaycee	though i do wonder if what AMD plan to do has a point
2014-12-05 07:46:04	Morgawr	nothing changed and yet here we are discussing it, AMD is turning towards mesa, intel is playing nicely with mesa and more and more games are coming to Linux
2014-12-05 07:46:13	Raven67854	Nvidia didn't change at all
2014-12-05 07:46:18	Raven67854	Nvidia still operates the same way
2014-12-05 07:46:19	@Samsai	you sure about that?
2014-12-05 07:46:21	Morgawr	does it?
2014-12-05 07:46:25	Raven67854	yes
2014-12-05 07:46:27	jaycee	it sounds like AMD are going to use Mesa for the kernel/xorg interface bollocks, but make all of the GL stuff proprietary
2014-12-05 07:46:28	Morgawr	I clearly recall various nvidia employees contributing to nouveau
2014-12-05 07:46:33	Morgawr	or, at least one
2014-12-05 07:46:37	Raven67854	Morgawr, But some did that before =/
2014-12-05 07:46:41	<--	Yamagata (~james@ip68-111-117-24.fv.ks.cox.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-12-05 07:46:42	Morgawr	I guess
2014-12-05 07:46:50	Raven67854	So yes nothing really changed
2014-12-05 07:46:54	Morgawr	I just feel like we're really talking about nothing here, tbh
2014-12-05 07:47:02	Morgawr	people say "hurr nvidia is evil" and "hurr linux devs are evil"
2014-12-05 07:47:12	jaycee	my point of view is this
2014-12-05 07:47:19	Morgawr	again, I'd rather trust the linux kernel devs to know what's best for Linux
2014-12-05 07:47:21	jaycee	nvidia provide an amazing driver to a very small market
2014-12-05 07:47:23	Raven67854	No one said Nvidia is evil or the linux devs are evil
2014-12-05 07:47:26	-->	Yamagata (~james@wsip-70-166-234-2.ks.ks.cox.net) has joined #gamingonlinux

2014-12-05 07:47:29	Raven67854	well jaycee probably did
2014-12-05 07:47:29	jaycee	a very well tuned one, that works very well

2014-12-05 07:47:37	jaycee	so far, all that the Linux devs have done, have shit on them for it
2014-12-05 07:47:52	jaycee	and applauded intel, but look
2014-12-05 07:47:56	@Samsai	that would be some kernel devs
2014-12-05 07:47:56	jaycee	intel's driver is *shit*
2014-12-05 07:48:02	Morgawr	jaycee: who gives a shit if it works well if it doesn't work with the rest of the environment and it actually tries to fuck up and undermine the effort of the thousands of developers contributing to the linux kernel
2014-12-05 07:48:17	jaycee	its bad enough that the gpus themselves are shit, but well, the intel mesa driver is a fucking joke considering how much they spent on it
2014-12-05 07:48:24	Morgawr	seems to work fine for me, again
2014-12-05 07:48:30	Morgawr	maybe it doesn't support all the games out there
2014-12-05 07:48:34	Morgawr	but I'm happy with it
2014-12-05 07:48:36	jaycee	it doesnt work fine, you obviously didnt benchmark it against windows
2014-12-05 07:48:41	jaycee	the performance is dire
2014-12-05 07:48:45	Morgawr	why would I benchmark against windows
2014-12-05 07:48:47	Morgawr	I don't use windows
2014-12-05 07:48:48	@Samsai	but often good enough
2014-12-05 07:48:52	Morgawr	I'm not saying "it's better"
2014-12-05 07:48:56	Morgawr	I'm saying "it works well enough"
2014-12-05 07:48:58	Morgawr	and I'm happy for it
2014-12-05 07:49:00	jaycee	but thats it, it doesnt work well enough
2014-12-05 07:49:01	Morgawr	I'm happy if it can be improved
2014-12-05 07:49:05	Morgawr	it does work well enough
2014-12-05 07:49:09	jaycee	unless you want to run really old games
2014-12-05 07:49:13	Morgawr	as I have around 100-150 games on steam that work on it
2014-12-05 07:49:21	Morgawr	I run new games too
2014-12-05 07:49:25	jaycee	like hell you do
2014-12-05 07:49:30	Morgawr	is Metro the last light an old game?
2014-12-05 07:49:34	Morgawr	Borderlands 2? (well, it's from 2012)
2014-12-05 07:49:49	jaycee	are those renderers doing high end dx9/dx10/dx11 grade stuff ? no
2014-12-05 07:49:52	jaycee	is Source1 ? no
2014-12-05 07:49:52	@Samsai	jaycee, well then, jaycee, give us a game that fits your category of a new game with linux support that doesn't work on intel
2014-12-05 07:50:00	Morgawr	16:48 < Morgawr> I'm not saying "it's better"
2014-12-05 07:50:00	Morgawr	16:48 < Morgawr> I'm saying "it works well enough"
2014-12-05 07:50:03	Morgawr	maybe you missed this, jaycee

2014-12-05 07:50:52	jaycee	Samsai, oh look, Aspyr have just said they wont support it with CivBE
2014-12-05 07:51:03	@Samsai	jaycee, "probably"
2014-12-05 07:51:07	Morgawr	same as borderlands 2
2014-12-05 07:51:08	@Samsai	and it might still very well work
2014-12-05 07:51:10	Morgawr	but I still run it
2014-12-05 07:51:11	jaycee	im sure theres plenty that wont work right with the intel driver, and im not surprised, its crap
2014-12-05 07:51:24	Morgawr	your logic is being a bit circular there
2014-12-05 07:51:32	-->	millan (~millan@rrerror.sinus.cz) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-05 07:51:33	jaycee	i can at least run w2 through eon on an intel iris mac with similar performance to window
2014-12-05 07:51:34	@Samsai	jaycee, so basically "i don't have anything to back my claim up, but i'm sure i'm right!"
2014-12-05 07:51:35	Morgawr	it's not crap, it's not perfect, but "crap" is just being ungrateful
2014-12-05 07:51:48	jaycee	on linux, no we cant, and half the time we either get rendering glitches, or it crashes in the driver
2014-12-05 07:51:52	Morgawr	sounds like you guys need to port it better ;)
2014-12-05 07:52:02	jaycee	Morgawr, what you mean with the *same code* that works just fine on the mac?
2014-12-05 07:52:15	Morgawr	color me surprised when Linux is not Mac
2014-12-05 07:52:22	Morgawr	I didn't realize we were in #gamingonmac
2014-12-05 07:52:23	@Samsai	well, i've heard some complaints from mac people too about witcher 2, so...
2014-12-05 07:52:24	jaycee	no, and this is what really fucks me off the most, when you guys will not fucking accept that the problem is *linux side*
2014-12-05 07:52:33	Morgawr	"you guys"
2014-12-05 07:52:42	jaycee	Samsai, mostly dumbasses trying to run it on gpu's we've already said are too old
2014-12-05 07:52:43	Morgawr	you're the one claiming intel drivers are shit
2014-12-05 07:52:48	@Samsai	jaycee, of course
2014-12-05 07:52:51	Morgawr	when all we're saying is they aren't perfect but they aren't bad
2014-12-05 07:52:54	Morgawr	there's always room for improvement
2014-12-05 07:52:58	Morgawr	just don't be an ungrateful prick
2014-12-05 07:53:11	jaycee	Samsai, or on intel 4000, because of an apple bug, it runs but there are rendering artefacts
2014-12-05 07:53:20	jaycee	(yes we reported it, no apple dont seem to care)
2014-12-05 07:53:36	Morgawr	saying "no new games run on intel" is a flat out lie that you shouldn't spread around in a channel with people who may or may not be interested in gaming on linux using an intel GPU
2014-12-05 07:54:00	jaycee	well, you seem intent just to blame developers when games dont work on the intel or mesa drivers
2014-12-05 07:54:09	Morgawr	where did I say that?
2014-12-05 07:54:09	jaycee	must always be our fault right ? we dont support open source obviously..
2014-12-05 07:54:11	jaycee	pff
2014-12-05 07:54:17	Morgawr	I acknowledged the fact that intel drivers aren't perfect multiple times
2014-12-05 07:54:19	jaycee	im sick of reading people saying it
2014-12-05 07:54:34	jaycee	"oh it only runs well on nvidias blob, the developers suck"
2014-12-05 07:54:46	turol	jaycee: do you use valgrind?
2014-12-05 07:54:50	Morgawr	sounds like you're being awfully defensive there and arguing a position nobody argued against
2014-12-05 07:54:52	jaycee	turol, nope
2014-12-05 07:54:58	turol	the nvidia drivers at least are clean for it
2014-12-05 07:55:10	jaycee	valgrind is simply too slow
2014-12-05 07:55:12	turol	i've only seen valgrind report issues that are actually in my code
2014-12-05 07:55:20	turol	yeah it's slow but it's also extremely useful
2014-12-05 07:56:28	Morgawr	also where did aspyr say they're not going to support civ:be on intel gpu? I'm curious because I preordered it and I'll be very sad when/if I can't run it on intel :(
2014-12-05 07:56:38	@Samsai	Morgawr, on their blog
2014-12-05 07:56:49	Morgawr	Samsai: got a quick link? otherwise I'll go look for it when I get home

2014-12-05 07:58:05	@Samsai	anyway, i'm off for a moment
2014-12-05 07:58:06	Morgawr	heh

2014-12-05 07:58:19	jaycee	obviously aspyr suck :P
2014-12-05 07:58:32	Morgawr	dropping support for intel... I guess, but dropping support for AMD in general? sounds like an issue of "we need to release it on time so we're cutting corners"
2014-12-05 07:58:46	jaycee	see, this is exactly what im fucking talking about
2014-12-05 07:58:48	Morgawr	I love Aspyr, all of their games really work well on my cards too so I'm confident they can solve it, hopefully
2014-12-05 07:58:52	 *	Morgawr crosses fingers
2014-12-05 07:59:01	jaycee	or you could accept that the Intel driver CANT DO WHAT THEY NEED IT TO DO
2014-12-05 07:59:09	jaycee	and put the blame on the right people - Intel
2014-12-05 07:59:17	Morgawr	why would I do that
2014-12-05 07:59:25	turol	because it happens to be true?
2014-12-05 07:59:25	jaycee	sigh
2014-12-05 07:59:29	Morgawr	I'm not putting the blame on anyone
2014-12-05 07:59:31	Morgawr	there are bugs
2014-12-05 07:59:34	Morgawr	there are problems
2014-12-05 07:59:45	jaycee	yes, so blame INTEL FOR IT. their driver doesnt WORK, so they have to fix it!
2014-12-05 07:59:45	Morgawr	as a developer I know this stuff can happen, I'm not resenting anyone
2014-12-05 07:59:48	jaycee	stop blaming us!!
2014-12-05 07:59:51	Morgawr	"us"?
2014-12-05 07:59:55	jaycee	game devs
2014-12-05 08:00:11	Morgawr	everyone gets a little bit of blame :P hopefully problems and bugs can be solved
2014-12-05 08:00:14	Morgawr	the drivers are open source
2014-12-05 08:00:21	Morgawr	intel and amd will keep improving them
2014-12-05 08:00:27	Morgawr	developers will find workarounds
2014-12-05 08:00:33	jaycee	no, we wont
2014-12-05 08:00:44	jaycee	either the features we need work or they dont
2014-12-05 08:00:45	Morgawr	okay jaycee, I'm glad you can vouch for the whole gamedev community
2014-12-05 08:00:54	Morgawr	it's like I'm really just talking to a wall
2014-12-05 08:00:56	jaycee	if they dont work, we say "these features dont work" and thats it
2014-12-05 08:00:57	turol	Morgawr: have you SEEN the bitching on phoronix forums about this?
2014-12-05 08:01:13	Morgawr	turol: people's gonna bitch everywhere, have you seen the bitching on youtube comments on any cat video? :P
2014-12-05 08:01:24	turol	nope, i browse youtube with js off
2014-12-05 08:01:29	turol	kills the comments
2014-12-05 08:01:31	Morgawr	a wise choice
2014-12-05 08:02:06	Morgawr	but yeah jaycee, I never claimed mesa to be perfect, I acknowledged several times that intel drivers have issues
2014-12-05 08:02:14	Morgawr	so I don't honestly know what you want me to say more than that
2014-12-05 08:02:29	Nothing_Much	tadzik: lolololol
2014-12-05 08:02:37	drumr	intel driver not the issue but their hardware for graphics
2014-12-05 08:02:52	drumr	just cant compete
2014-12-05 08:03:01	Morgawr	drumr: that's another problem though
2014-12-05 08:03:11	jaycee	Morgawr, i want you to stop blaming game devs when we say "we cant support intel" or "we cant support mesa" because the feature set is either not there, or doesnt work correctly, instead of spouting shit like "the devs are lazy/lame"
2014-12-05 08:03:22	Morgawr	but yeah, if you buy intel don't expect to play all new games etc etc, that's something I came to term with when I chose to buy my laptop
2014-12-05 08:03:24	drumr	i know but i just stay away from intel
2014-12-05 08:03:25	jaycee	which is what fucking happens
2014-12-05 08:03:38	Morgawr	jaycee: I never blamed game developers unjustly, stop projecting your problems onto me
2014-12-05 08:03:59	Morgawr	the only one time I blamed game developers for their ineptitude is when I got pissed off at wasteland 2 not working on intel graphics
2014-12-05 08:04:01	jaycee	but you did with what you just said about aspyr "cutting corners"
2014-12-05 08:04:02	Morgawr	because it does work on wine

2014-12-05 08:04:33	Morgawr	jaycee: I didn't blame them for cutting corners, I'm confident there is a way to get it to work EXCEPT it's not worth it and it's not possible to do that before release so I acknowledge that fact and move on
2014-12-05 08:05:02	jaycee	<Morgawr> dropping support for intel... I guess, but dropping support for AMD in general? sounds like an issue of "we need to release it on time so we're cutting corners"
2014-12-05 08:05:03	Morgawr	jaycee: you don't get it, on wine the shader works fine, on native it doesn't work because it's broken/buggy
2014-12-05 08:05:18	Morgawr	jaycee: yes, it's an issue of "we need to release it on time" and that's a wise choice
2014-12-05 08:05:24	Morgawr	I wasn't blaming them
2014-12-05 08:05:28	Morgawr	I was agreeing with their choice

2014-12-05 08:08:45	Morgawr	drumr: it's an acceptable decision if it doens't fit their budget and they need to release it on time
2014-12-05 08:08:55	Morgawr	especially since they can add/patch support later
2014-12-05 08:09:17	jaycee	or they can wait for intel or whoever to pull their finger out and fix their damn driver
2014-12-05 08:09:31	Morgawr	which is what I was implying, I meant to say "It's not weird to decide not to support intel altogether, but since they also mention AMD it probably means they are forced to release it as-is at the moment and hopefully add support for either later"
2014-12-05 08:09:40	Morgawr	jaycee: did you miss the part about ATI too?
2014-12-05 08:09:53	Morgawr	why do you hate intel so much, did they kill your family or something?
2014-12-05 08:09:54	jaycee	right, because catalyst isnt broken at all..
2014-12-05 08:10:00	Morgawr	try to be a bit objective
2014-12-05 08:10:59	drumr	do a patch or update later is a plague in the current age of gaming and is terrible business practice
2014-12-05 08:11:29	turol	drumr: do you want software to cost 10x as much?
2014-12-05 08:11:30	drumr	if you cant support the major three hardware platform it needs to be put on hold until it can be done rather than shoving ti to market
2014-12-05 08:11:45	turol	because getting all the bugs out is HARD!
2014-12-05 08:11:45	drumr	games have been released before
2014-12-05 08:12:02	turol	when?
2014-12-05 08:12:07	turol	i remember patches way back in the 90s
2014-12-05 08:12:16	Morgawr	drumr: how is a patch/update a plague in the current age of gaming, we have steam, digital distributor, automatic updates, etc etc
2014-12-05 08:12:19	drumr	yeah a game only had a couple in the life of support
2014-12-05 08:12:22	Morgawr	have you ever bought a game from a CD 10 years ago?
2014-12-05 08:12:30	Morgawr	that was a pain in the ass to patch and fix
2014-12-05 08:12:42	Morgawr	console games had to be perfect with absolutely 0 bugs
2014-12-05 08:12:46	Morgawr	because you couldn't patch them
2014-12-05 08:12:47	drumr	ive been dealing with games for over 25 years
2014-12-05 08:12:55	Morgawr	so  you know what I'm talking about
2014-12-05 08:13:14	turol	consoles (nes era) were simple enough you could keep the whole system spec in your head
2014-12-05 08:13:21	drumr	i do but companies but some part of the business model is broken
2014-12-05 08:13:42	drumr	well you only had to program for one hardware configuration if it was a single console release
2014-12-05 08:13:52	drumr	sure pc has different confiurations
2014-12-05 08:14:03	drumr	but many things still remain the same
2014-12-05 08:14:31	drumr	minor bugs is one thing but when the game is somewhat broken
2014-12-05 08:14:35	turol	drumr: are you a programmer?
2014-12-05 08:14:36	drumr	thats a huge issue

2014-12-05 09:02:06	jaycee	well, just in general. i notice SDL2 dynamically loads GL, and allows you to specify the name of the lib as well. i just wondered why that was
2014-12-05 09:02:18	jaycee	it seems very odd to me
2014-12-05 09:02:47	jaycee	on windows, youd link to opengl32.dll and it always gives you the right driver. on osx, you link to OpenGL.framework, and same.. but we all know linux can be special :)

2014-12-05 09:10:29	turol	if using core you should set glewExperimental = true; before glewInit()
2014-12-05 09:10:40	jaycee	yeah, did that, still doesnt work

2014-12-05 09:40:06	jasonm	that just means more Linux games on the way ;)
2014-12-05 09:41:38	Raven67854	liamdawe, jaycee claims that vp has taken an aspyr title and will be brining it to Linux. And that it has dx11 and is 20gb in size. So that basically just leaves bioshock infinite. Seems strange to not let aspyr port a title they've done already. So it's just a theory really
2014-12-05 09:41:43	Raven67854	But it matches to what jaycee has said at least
2014-12-05 09:42:08	Raven67854	Unless it's some unnanounced title aspyr was doing

2014-12-05 13:07:39	mETz	the startup script also looks pretty workaround-loaded to me, like using xwininfo on the root window to "detect" the resoluton
2014-12-05 13:09:11	hidekin1	no problem if you know how to do the mappings but for average users who will maybe have a steam machine it's still not there yet

There's always that small (2px wide), distracting line and since tint2 is placed vertically and on the right side of the screen, I can't access the scrollbars of most fullscreen applications. Would be lovely if there was a way to push that line off the screen and make the panel only appear when the cursor has moved off the screen.

2014-12-06 07:50:44	jaycee	heh, annoying that steam downloads depots even though the game isnt marked for linux yet
2014-12-06 07:51:43	ImperialXT	jaycee: it does that for pillars of eternity also
2014-12-06 07:52:22	DrMcCoy	Also annoying that it leads to devs never marking Linux on the game
2014-12-06 07:52:25	jaycee	its done that when we've worked on stuff, just because we've set depots to be available for Linux. whats supposed to happen is it's not supposed to do that until you set the app as being available for Linux
2014-12-06 07:52:41	jaycee	unless you have a "developer comp" package which overrides it
2014-12-06 07:55:04	drumr	interesting
2014-12-06 07:55:43	jaycee	guess someone cocked up here. first time i did a linux steam depot i accidentally marked the game available. that got a lot of people excited with witcher2 :)
2014-12-06 07:56:27	drumr	hehe
2014-12-06 07:59:27	jaycee	been told its 40GB :o christ, i though w2 was big

2014-12-06 08:02:27	jaycee	thankfully, we didnt have to mess with any of that on steam, cdpr had done their depot setup correctly :)

2014-12-06 08:21:58	Raven67854	jaycee, times have changed
2014-12-06 08:22:12	jaycee	yeah makes you feel bloody old lol
2014-12-06 08:22:43	jaycee	sad thing is, a lot of games now look very pretty, but have absolutely no gameplay
2014-12-06 08:23:01	jaycee	some of them are pretty much interactive movies, i hate that
2014-12-06 08:23:20	@Samsai	and some games look horrible, play horrible and take tons of space
2014-12-06 08:23:21	jaycee	cutscene, click here, cutscene, shoot him, cutscene, pick item up, cutscene
2014-12-06 08:25:29	jaycee	witcher 2, i actually thoroughly enjoyed playing, i wasnt much involved with our Mac port but did plenty of playtesting on it.. was very pleased when i got to be involved in the linux port :)
2014-12-06 08:30:33	jaycee	oh, intel people might be pleased to know, i was contacted by someone from Valve last night - both them and Intel are looking at what's holding Witcher 2 back on intel Iris.. they see it's a driver thing and are working on it
2014-12-06 08:32:12	hidekin	good news :-) It can be useful for my next laptop
2014-12-06 08:34:18	jaycee	ian romanick saw it some time ago... and said "ugh, we should be far better than that"
2014-12-06 08:34:37	hidekin	on your port i'm 20 fps less in avergage than windows but it's playable. With my gtx 770 in ultra in 1920x1200 i'm around 50-70 fps
2014-12-06 08:35:46	jaycee	gl itself is going to be some overhead simply by the fact that its not threaded
2014-12-06 08:36:06	jaycee	that one will bite you, native or not really

2014-12-06 08:38:42	jaycee	youd have to ask cdpr about that one.. all i will say is, we recently did a mac port to replace the wineskin version :)
2014-12-06 08:40:05	hidekin	Yes i know :-)  I'm already glad to have the second one on linux :-)
2014-12-06 08:41:20	hidekin	I'll try to at least let them know by email or twitter that there's some interest even if it's only one person lol
2014-12-06 08:45:50	jaycee	there does seem to be plenty of call for it on steam, id guess theyre wondering if theres any point when people can just run it very well in wine
2014-12-06 08:46:12	jaycee	osx had trouble with wine, because it no longer ships with x11 which wine on osx seems to need

2014-12-06 08:46:25	jaycee	so there, our port just runs out of the box with no hassle
2014-12-06 08:49:12	hidekin	maybe they're waiting for the steam machines or giving a better experience with the launch of gog galaxy platform . Wine is nice if you know how to do it , but for linux beginner users it's not that easy to debug and found the appropriate library and so on
2014-12-06 08:49:30	jaycee	even if you know what youre doing, wine is a pain
2014-12-06 08:50:02	Raven67854	Not really
2014-12-06 08:50:13	Raven67854	I suppose maybe on OS X it is
2014-12-06 08:50:19	Raven67854	Everything on OS X seems to be a bloody pain
2014-12-06 08:50:23	hidekin	Yes especially if you don't have a prefix
2014-12-06 08:50:33	jaycee	well it was annoying on linux, granted PlayOnLinux takes quite a lot of the pain away
2014-12-06 08:51:20	hidekin	i had torchlights 2 working on playonlinux and giana sisters after their updates of the game it's not working anymore with wine
2014-12-06 08:51:38	jaycee	afaik if its a game needing steam, you have to run steam inside wine too
2014-12-06 08:52:06	Raven67854	Obviously
2014-12-06 08:52:45	hidekin	still waiting for the port promised by humble bundle for giana sisters
2014-12-06 08:52:48	jaycee	we wrote a bridge for steam_api so that steam_api.dll on the "windows" side is really steam_api.so :)
2014-12-06 08:53:13	jaycee	pretty much just juggling VC's "thiscall" to gcc/clang's equivalent really
2014-12-06 08:53:20	Raven67854	Still would need steam though
2014-12-06 08:53:32	jaycee	of course
2014-12-06 08:53:34	Raven67854	I have a few wine wrapped steam games
2014-12-06 08:53:41	Raven67854	They work okay
2014-12-06 08:53:55	Raven67854	Except for System Shock 2. I just setup that one manually
2014-12-06 08:53:56	jaycee	yeah if theyre not using steamworks itself it should do
2014-12-06 08:54:54	hidekin	system shock 2 , the game is that old that they lost the source code
2014-12-06 08:54:59	Raven67854	I don't really use wine all that much though
2014-12-06 08:55:08	Raven67854	hidekin, they didn't lose the code because of age
2014-12-06 08:55:57	hidekin	ah it was something else ? bad backup ?
2014-12-06 08:55:58	Raven67854	Looking glass went under
2014-12-06 08:56:16	Raven67854	Quite a few years ago though some of the source leaked onto pirate bay
2014-12-06 08:56:34	Raven67854	But I don't think it was the games source. Just an old developer who had some of the assets
2014-12-06 08:56:52	hidekin	yes i heard about that , but if the source code is obtained illegaly i don't think by law they can use it
2014-12-06 08:57:04	Raven67854	Well whoever owns the IP can
2014-12-06 08:57:14	Raven67854	Also there was a fight many years over who owned the IP

2014-12-07 07:30:11	jaycee	"I totally agree that this current steamdb status is very strange. There have not been any Linux games that I've seen so far that simply share the Windows Depots, not even Witcher 2 and Stronghold 3 which are VP ports with eON."
2014-12-07 07:30:36	jaycee	completely wrong. the Mac and Linux versions of Witcher 2 and Stronghold 3 use exactly the same data as the Windows version
2014-12-07 07:39:17	@Samsai	jaycee, so the steamdb status is exactly like stronghold 3 and witcher 2?
2014-12-07 07:39:24	@Samsai	is this a hint of some sort?
2014-12-07 07:39:38	jaycee	no :) just correcting misinformation
2014-12-07 07:39:54	jaycee	sometimes depots get duplicated, but often it's more to do with layout arrangement
2014-12-07 07:40:06	DrMcCoy	Yeah, I've seen this quite often that games share a data depot among all platforms and have platform-specific binary depots
2014-12-07 07:40:18	jaycee	from what i can tell with the aspyr port of bioshock infinite, its simply because they weanted the data inside the app bundle. no idea why they'd care about that
2014-12-07 07:40:40	jaycee	DrMcCoy, thats how it should work... 99.9% of the time, the actual data is identical
2014-12-07 07:40:51	jaycee	so it's only binary components that need to be platform specific
2014-12-07 07:41:01	DrMcCoy	Samsai: By now it's really very obvious that the mysterious game jaycee is eOn'ing is Bioshock Infinite, no matter his protestation of "I'm not telling"
2014-12-07 07:41:08	jaycee	but some publishers are very sloppy when they put stuff on steam...
2014-12-07 07:41:21	jaycee	why is it obvious, just because i know things about steamworks ? :P
2014-12-07 07:41:36	@Samsai	i believe feral mentioned that they changed some of the data to something more compatible with the native system with xcom
2014-12-07 07:42:02	jaycee	yeah you dont really want to be cooking your own data though unless theres a very good reason
2014-12-07 07:42:09	@Samsai	they re-encoded some of the videos or something
2014-12-07 07:42:14	DrMcCoy	jaycee: It's a 20GB game, you've been complaining about the exact depot constellation, the dev/port history fits (Mac done by Aspyr), ...
2014-12-07 07:42:37	jaycee	DrMcCoy, my installed copy of bioshock infinite (which i bought) is 40G actually :)
2014-12-07 07:43:23	@Samsai	DrMcCoy, well, i guess we will see the truth in "early 2015"
2014-12-07 07:43:27	DrMcCoy	jaycee: With DLC.
2014-12-07 07:43:58	jaycee	mmhmm, and ?
2014-12-07 07:44:20	DrMcCoy	jaycee: But the main content depot is 15GB, movies and locale stuff puts it at around 20GB
2014-12-07 07:44:25	DrMcCoy	In either case, I'm calling it
2014-12-07 07:44:39	jaycee	shrug :)
2014-12-07 07:45:10	DrMcCoy	I don't like it, but it could have been worse. I personally don't care that much for Bioshock Infinite
2014-12-07 07:45:20	jaycee	we've worked with 2k before, we did spec ops, so im pretty sure i'd know if we were doing bioshock :)
2014-12-07 07:45:40	DrMcCoy	I am saying that you do know
2014-12-07 07:46:08	jaycee	well, you always do like to put words in my mouth so :)

2014-12-07 07:46:38	DerRidda	Yeah, there are plenty of games that share repos between platforms for assets and such.
2014-12-07 07:47:17	DerRidda	Some even share all of them and then just use a different launch script per platform.
2014-12-07 07:47:19	jaycee	DerRidda, its how you should do it, its why steam has multiple depots for a game, and allows them to have platform configuration
2014-12-07 07:47:19	DrMcCoy	jaycee: I don't *like* putting words in your mouth. It's just that the words already in there are BS
2014-12-07 07:49:36	DerRidda	Bioshock Infinite is going to be covered in the next SteamLUG cast because it's obviously news. On that note: jaycee, is VP doing the port of Bioshock infinite?
2014-12-07 07:50:01	jaycee	no comment.
2014-12-07 07:50:14	DrMcCoy	duh
2014-12-07 07:50:21	jaycee	ive been told, we dont talk about what we're working on
2014-12-07 07:50:24	jaycee	or not working on
2014-12-07 07:50:38	DrMcCoy	That at least I can understand
2014-12-07 07:51:37	jaycee	2K got pissy at Liam for "leaking the story".. which was a bit LOLable, but im not about to do or say anything that damages our relationship with them
2014-12-07 07:52:00	@Samsai	so... yes?
2014-12-07 07:52:03	DerRidda	Would not surprise me if VP did or it was in-house. It seems like 2K is spreading their niche platform efforts around plenty, which is smart. Gauge every option there is.
2014-12-07 07:52:10	DrMcCoy	People need to learn that Steam depot changes are public...
2014-12-07 07:52:29	DerRidda	Indeed they are.

2014-12-07 07:53:38	jaycee	dont think it'd be valve's choice exactly if it happens
2014-12-07 07:54:00	DrMcCoy	And it's actually helpful quite often, when small devs don't know what they're doing and you can point out that their depot configuration is wrong
2014-12-07 07:54:26	DerRidda	I love how Feral#s marketing still thinks that it is any secret that they are working on Empire: total War.
2014-12-07 07:54:36	jaycee	well, thats what steam support is for, they have a private group on steam for things like that
2014-12-07 07:55:08	DrMcCoy	Either that support is quite bad, or those small devs don't know about it, then
2014-12-07 07:56:38	Raven67854	DerRidda, Empire:Total War is meh.. Napoleon:Total War is a much nicer game. Bummer we aren't getting that

2014-12-07 07:57:26	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, What game was that
2014-12-07 07:58:11	DrMcCoy	uah, as if I'd remember
2014-12-07 07:58:26	DrMcCoy	Wasn't just one game either
2014-12-07 07:59:10	jaycee	DrMcCoy, we've never really had any trouble with valve, sometimes it takes them a few hours to answer, but they do answer
2014-12-07 08:00:15	Raven67854	DerRidda, I do agree it's funny Feral thinks we don't know :).
2014-12-07 08:00:27	Raven67854	Isn't it possible to make private depots on steam that aren't trackable on steamdb?
2014-12-07 08:00:53	jaycee	nope
2014-12-07 08:01:33	jaycee	the depots/app database is all a public api
2014-12-07 08:01:57	jaycee	you dont even need a steamid to read it afaik

2014-12-07 08:03:32	jaycee	my guess there would be the depots were configured, but they didnt have depot ownership right in the packages
2014-12-07 08:04:12	jaycee	which steamworks management interface is a bit poor at tbh, it can be confusing
2014-12-07 08:04:43	jaycee	but seriously, if they were stumped on that for ages, they obviously didnt bother contacting steamworks support
2014-12-07 08:05:13	jaycee	we had the same issue the first time we did something on steam for the mac, contacted valve, in 15 minutes they'd pointed out the problem
2014-12-07 08:05:33	DrMcCoy	Do you still need to run a weird Windows batch file to deploy a game? I've read that in their docs a few months ago
2014-12-07 08:06:25	jaycee	no, you had to use the commandline steam client to deploy stuff, but theres been mac and linux versions of it for about a year now
2014-12-07 08:07:00	DrMcCoy	I've never seen the steamworks side of things, only read the publically available docs, and those said "This won't work on Linux"
2014-12-07 08:07:41	jaycee	the "wierd windows batch file" was just launching the commandline client with particular parameters
2014-12-07 08:07:52	DrMcCoy	Ah, okay
2014-12-07 08:07:58	jaycee	pretty much, log in, run an app build for this script, wait for a key
2014-12-07 08:08:28	jaycee	"script" is a bit loose, .vdf is pretty much a bastardised json :) i do wonder why they didnt just use json
2014-12-07 08:08:39	Raven67854	Because valve
2014-12-07 08:09:45	DrMcCoy	Narf, unrelated topic, but I hate that the Steam client doesn't correctly follow the usual select-to-copy + middle-click-to-paste on Linux...
2014-12-07 08:10:16	jaycee	i actually find it annoying that theres two clipboards
2014-12-07 08:10:26	jaycee	that one youve just mentioned, and whatever ctrl-c/ctrl-v uses
2014-12-07 08:11:35	DrMcCoy	I hate that ctrl-c/ctrl-v is even a thing. It shouldn't be
2014-12-07 08:11:46	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, what why?
2014-12-07 08:11:56	jaycee	just to be different from every other os huh :P
2014-12-07 08:12:52	@Samsai	DrMcCoy, do you mean completely or the way it is implemented at the moment?
2014-12-07 08:13:08	@Samsai	because i like to have quick key combinations for copying and pasting
2014-12-07 08:13:30	DrMcCoy	Completely :P
2014-12-07 08:13:43	@Samsai	why?
2014-12-07 08:13:54	@Samsai	it's useful
2014-12-07 08:13:54	DrMcCoy	But yeah, I'd be okay if that would go to the same clipboard
2014-12-07 08:14:06	jaycee	thats the problem, dual clipboards, what for
2014-12-07 08:14:07	@Samsai	ah, that i can understand
2014-12-07 08:14:08	DrMcCoy	Or could be configured like that
2014-12-07 08:15:53	frostwork	two clipboards are very useful very often. I can't understand how s.o. prefers having 1 instead of 2

2014-12-07 08:16:47	DrMcCoy	It gets pretty annoying when suddenly something only does one of them
2014-12-07 08:16:49	frostwork	you fill the clipboard yourself, so you should know which is filled with what
2014-12-07 08:17:00	DrMcCoy	Terminals only do selection clipboard
2014-12-07 08:17:06	DrMcCoy	Steam only does ctrl-c/ctrl-v
2014-12-07 08:17:18	jaycee	quite a lot of apps wont do middle paste either
2014-12-07 08:17:25	jaycee	because they use the middle mouse button for something
2014-12-07 08:17:37	DerRidda	Isn't middle click X11 specific?
2014-12-07 08:17:47	DrMcCoy	So now I have to paste something into Firefox's URL bar of put the stuff into the other clipboard

2014-12-07 08:18:49	DrMcCoy	Hmm, I could probably use xclip to copy them around too...
2014-12-07 08:18:50	Raven67854	Means when I want to copy something in vim I'd have to use my mouse
2014-12-07 08:19:05	Raven67854	Nobody has time to move hand away from keyboard to copy
2014-12-07 08:19:56	kkit_	depends on your terminal. kterm or whatever will paste from both, but you do shift-^C/^V

2014-12-07 08:22:32	drumr	hehe copypasta
2014-12-07 08:23:12	DrMcCoy	I'm also always annoyed when I type "ctrl-w" in Firefox because I want to delete the word left to the cursor (one of the readline key combos, via emacs I think) and find that I closed the tab instead
2014-12-07 08:23:38	DrMcCoy	And then it's a stupid JavaScript text box and all the text is gone when I unclose the tab...
2014-12-07 08:23:53	turol	DrMcCoy: there's an extension for that
2014-12-07 08:24:20	DrMcCoy	I know. I tried to use it years ago, but it somehow never worked like it should
2014-12-07 08:25:15	DrMcCoy	I also don't like the idea of having a key combo doing double-duty depending on context
2014-12-07 08:25:54	DrMcCoy	Like, apparently, in Firefox on Windows backspace does a history-back when not in a text box?!?
2014-12-07 08:25:58	DrMcCoy	That's just evil
2014-12-07 08:26:07	Raven67854	Why?
2014-12-07 08:26:58	frostwork	... care?
2014-12-07 08:27:23	DerRidda	Chromium does that on Linux as well.
2014-12-07 08:27:32	DrMcCoy	Because I maybe clicked somewhere prior, or changed desktops and the textbox lost focus, etc. pp and I accidentally lose all the text
2014-12-07 08:27:42	DrMcCoy	It's just evil
2014-12-07 08:28:34	frostwork	as in windows
2014-12-07 08:28:40	von	C-Insert/S-Insert anyone
2014-12-07 08:28:41	turol	that can be enabled on linux so presumable it can also be disabled on windows
2014-12-07 08:28:42	von	?
2014-12-07 08:28:50	DrMcCoy	DerRidda: Should I ever express wishes to try Chromium to get away from Firefox's increasing madness, do remind me of that
2014-12-07 08:29:22	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, could always move to midori
2014-12-07 08:29:27	DrMcCoy	turol: Yes, browser.backspace_action
2014-12-07 08:29:34	von	also love the ^Q hotkey in firefox
2014-12-07 08:29:41	von	and how close it is to ^W
2014-12-07 08:30:01	DrMcCoy	von: I use shift-insert all the time
2014-12-07 08:30:07	DrMcCoy	von: Because that uses the selection clipboard
2014-12-07 08:30:23	turol	von: oh yes there's also an extension for that
2014-12-07 08:30:34	von	I use that extension, yes
2014-12-07 08:30:40	turol	and the person who thought it up and made it impossible to disable needs to be taken out and shot
2014-12-07 08:31:01	DrMcCoy	von: Well, at least for ctrl-q, I have the session manager asking me whether I want to save the current session

2014-12-07 12:13:45	liamdawe	yeah, i pointed that out, and pointed steamdb out with a sarcy comment of "you know about steamdb right?"

2014-12-07 14:01:26	drumr	actually a modified cryengine
2014-12-07 14:01:39	drumr	because it was under powered for what the wii u is actually capable of

2014-12-07 14:09:18	Raven67854	You can only use UE4 if you have a UE4 license. Which is what $19/m?

2014-12-07 17:31:48	Raven67854	drumr, Unity was always offered. Unreal Engine 4 is just free now and doesn't have a huge expensive license in the way
2014-12-07 17:32:03	Raven67854	drumr, It's also correct about playstation. No special name for the program at all
2014-12-07 17:35:13	gnarface	Qwertie: no, they're totally different things that only incidentally appear to behave the same in some window managers in linux
2014-12-07 17:39:00	Qwertie	gnarface, Is there any windows equivalent?
2014-12-07 17:39:15	gnarface	Qwertie: i don't know enough about windows to know, but my suspicion is NO
2014-12-07 17:39:58	gnarface	Qwertie: the windows filesystems don't support them i think, but you can get 3rd party drivers for a linux filesystem that might, then move your windows install onto it, if you're desperate....
2014-12-07 17:40:13	Qwertie	Im sick of using windows 8 but every time I try and run linux I get a kernal panic
2014-12-07 17:40:39	gnarface	Qwertie: probably a kernel bug that can be avoided by using a different version or recompiling it without the faulty code/driver
2014-12-07 17:41:33	Qwertie	I have tried with multiple versions of ubuntu as well as mint and kubuntu
2014-12-07 17:42:02	gnarface	i recommend debian wheezy
2014-12-07 17:42:06	gnarface	its stable
2014-12-07 17:42:22	gnarface	what you're supposed to do is file a bug report though with your distro
2014-12-07 17:42:43	gnarface	nothing will get fixed if nobody complains through the right channels (not that its a guarantee or anything, but its known to work)
2014-12-07 17:43:33	Qwertie	It was actually working for a few weeks and the it started breaking. (chrome always crashed, things went wrong) and then it got stuck on grub while booting
2014-12-07 17:43:42	gnarface	i assume you were fully updated?
2014-12-07 17:43:48	gnarface	like, newest versions of everything?
2014-12-07 17:43:52	Qwertie	Should be
2014-12-07 17:44:20	Qwertie	I used the latest isos
2014-12-07 17:44:33	gnarface	ah, yea so the latest isos are actually usually quite old
2014-12-07 17:44:41	gnarface	with linux you're expected to run network updates after you finish the install
2014-12-07 17:44:53	gnarface	they're patching that stuff *daily*
2014-12-07 17:45:01	Qwertie	It never gets that far
2014-12-07 17:45:08	gnarface	on ubuntu as root you'd go "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade"
2014-12-07 17:45:13	gnarface	(for example)
2014-12-07 17:45:13	Qwertie	I cant even run the live os
2014-12-07 17:45:48	gnarface	hmm. well, your mileage may vary depending on how well your hardware is supported i guess
2014-12-07 17:46:31	Qwertie	Its all new
2014-12-07 17:46:55	gnarface	its counter-intuitive i know, but typically in linux its actually OLDER hardware that is supported better
2014-12-07 17:47:00	gnarface	the newest stuff rarely works right actually
2014-12-07 17:47:15	Qwertie	MoBo is msi Z97 MPOWERR

2014-12-07 19:17:06	Leftmost	I think he got a raw treatment over Witcher 2, and I think a lot of the comments on that thread are unnecessarily hostile, but I'll agree that he was pretty severely impolite a fair bit of the time.
2014-12-07 19:17:23	drumr	yeah its hard not to be when you have to be defensive
2014-12-07 19:17:42	BTRE	What bugged me wasn't being impolite but the fact that he just dismissed any other perspective as somehow invalid.

2014-12-07 19:48:56	kkit_	oh it does work great in wine

2014-12-08 01:21:44	NuSuey	well from my point of view, everyone who wants to port their games to linux (AAA titles) wants a slice of the pie whenever Steamboxes start selling..I mean, there aren't so many games on PS4 or XBOX either.. but back to the point, if you start your steambox, see ..oh .. bioshock infinite - this looks cool.. hell yeah I'll buy that
2014-12-08 01:22:49	Beamboom	Of course.
2014-12-08 01:23:18	NuSuey	I like the broadcast feature.. I presume they want to use it for steambox too, so if you checking out the library, open a game - you can see other people playing it.. seeing the gameplay helps to decide if you want to buy it
2014-12-08 01:23:39	NuSuey	and what do people do anyways if they want to buy a game ? they look for gameplay videos on youtube
2014-12-08 01:23:44	NuSuey	with this? dont need to..
2014-12-08 01:23:52	Beamboom	I can't believe anything else than that these ports must be done partially for their future potential, to be there when it hits the main market. I mean... We can at best offer an additional, what, 23% of the total sales
2014-12-08 01:23:57	NuSuey	really seeing this being useful in steambox
2014-12-08 01:24:21	NuSuey	Beamboom: yup
2014-12-08 01:24:25	Beamboom	Totally agree, I'm super excited about that feature

2014-12-08 01:28:17	Beamboom	That'd be an awesome next step
2014-12-08 01:28:27	NuSuey	yeah but they could just easily leave a button to .. join game (if you have it)
2014-12-08 01:28:40	Beamboom	if the game supports it, of course.

2014-12-08 03:24:49	Beamboom	Yeah makes sense, really. I would have assumed the API for the various controllers would have been close to identical

2014-12-08 03:47:45	Beamboom	Nope not bought it yet
2014-12-08 03:48:11	Beamboom	I'm a bit veary of buying games with such low metascores. I got a ridiculous amount of games to plow through now.
2014-12-08 03:48:28	Beamboom	But it does look interesting, so maybe someday :)
2014-12-08 03:49:09	Beamboom	I'm STILL playing Borderlands 2 ffs, it's an enormous amount of content i that game, especially if one include the DLCs

2014-12-08 05:10:55	azizLIGHT	what can i use to filter a rss feed of laptop deals (slickdeals)? i want to see results that have price less than X only
2014-12-08 05:11:29	tadzik	regular expressions
2014-12-08 05:11:47	tadzik	or perhaps a proper rss parser :)
2014-12-08 05:12:11	azizLIGHT	yes, for example?
2014-12-08 05:12:11	tadzik	shouldn't be too hard to write yourself something that fetches an RSS, filters it and exposes it somewhere where your regular RSS reader can see it
2014-12-08 05:12:18	tadzik	I was using feedparser in python
2014-12-08 05:12:42	azizLIGHT	is it hard to use
2014-12-08 05:12:57	tadzik	it was so good that it made me choke back my tears that are always there when using python :P
2014-12-08 05:13:26	azizLIGHT	python is good or bad? why are you crying
2014-12-08 05:13:33	tadzik	I don't really like python
2014-12-08 05:14:00	tadzik	but feedparser was a lot better than the Perl alternatives I found
2014-12-08 05:15:47	tadzik	I can help you write it if you want to
2014-12-08 05:16:38	azizLIGHT	im not familiar with python so much
2014-12-08 05:16:56	azizLIGHT	i always endup doing things in bash in wierd ways, because its the only one i know a bit
2014-12-08 05:17:23	tadzik	I see
2014-12-08 05:17:49	tadzik	you can probably modify https://github.com/tadzik/feed2mbox/blob/master/feed2mbox.py quite easily
2014-12-08 05:17:50	GolliumBot	[ feed2mbox/feed2mbox.py at master · tadzik/feed2mbox · GitHub ] - github.com
2014-12-08 05:17:54	tadzik	it worked last time I used it
2014-12-08 05:17:55	azizLIGHT	oh hmm i thought i ws on #linux
2014-12-08 05:18:06	azizLIGHT	lol
2014-12-08 05:18:33	azizLIGHT	do you use this a lot?
2014-12-08 05:19:47	tadzik	not at all
2014-12-08 05:20:10	tadzik	written in may 2010, I seem to recall it had some flaws
2014-12-08 05:20:33	azizLIGHT	ill download it and fool around and see what i can manage
2014-12-08 05:20:34	tadzik	right; it operates under the assumption that RSS feeds can get their shit right when it comes to timestamps
2014-12-08 05:20:40	tadzik	(they don't)
2014-12-08 05:20:43	azizLIGHT	heh
2014-12-08 05:20:52	tadzik	that's why regular RSS readers keep a hash of every RSS entry they ever downloaded
2014-12-08 05:21:21	tadzik	because you can't rely on the fact that they will keep the last_updated timestamp correct
2014-12-08 05:21:51	tadzik	and every now and then it will just re-send you everything that the feed contains because someone on the server side fucked up time
2014-12-08 05:22:12	azizLIGHT	hmmmm
2014-12-08 05:22:21	tadzik	still, it may be good enough for your purposes :)
2014-12-08 05:24:30	Pyrus	for writing stuff to the mailbox format of your choice, you can look at the mailbox python module as well
2014-12-08 05:25:00	azizLIGHT	tadzik: i added my feed to .config/feed2mbox and did ./feed2mbox.py and i got no error or output
2014-12-08 05:25:22	tadzik	azizLIGHT: remember about a 0 after every URL

2014-12-08 05:26:34	tadzik	oh, cool :)
2014-12-08 05:26:56	azizLIGHT	how do i go about doign the price under $X bit i was asking about, from this
2014-12-08 05:27:02	azizLIGHT	the filtering bit
2014-12-08 05:27:39	tadzik	let's see
2014-12-08 05:28:00	tadzik	you probably need to use http://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/reference-entry-summary_detail.html
2014-12-08 05:28:01	GolliumBot	[ entries[i].summary_detail — feedparser 5.1.3 documentation ] - pythonhosted.org
2014-12-08 05:28:28	tadzik	it's even there in line #46
2014-12-08 05:28:51	tadzik	what I'd do is just try to match that against a regex that looks for a price tag
2014-12-08 05:29:38	tadzik	so something like re.match(entry.summary_detail, r"\b\$(\d+)\b")
2014-12-08 05:29:52	tadzik	well, reverse the arguments, regex first, then string
2014-12-08 05:30:06	tadzik	and see if what comes out of it is lower than what you want it to be
2014-12-08 05:30:56	tadzik	now, this script produces an mbox file, so you can append it something that your mail reader can read
2014-12-08 05:31:14	tadzik	and then run the script every hour or so
2014-12-08 05:31:33	tadzik	I can help you writing it later, but for now I need to go to the airport
2014-12-08 05:31:42	azizLIGHT	hmmm i got a bit lost when you said re.match(entry.summary_detail, r"\b\$(\d+)\b")
2014-12-08 05:31:52	tadzik	you know regexes, like with grep and sed and whatnot?
2014-12-08 05:32:05	azizLIGHT	some basic stuff yes
2014-12-08 05:32:07	tadzik	okay
2014-12-08 05:32:36	tadzik	so the above means "scan entry.summary_detail, look for something that looks like «word boundary, then dollar sign, then some digits then word boundary» and give me those digits"
2014-12-08 05:32:58	tadzik	tl;dr it will extract the price
2014-12-08 05:33:06	tadzik	(hopefully)
2014-12-08 05:33:41	tadzik	keep in mind that it may find more than one, depending on what the feed contains
2014-12-08 05:33:46	azizLIGHT	ok that makes more sense
2014-12-08 05:33:54	azizLIGHT	yes they have sometimes 2 prices in the feed
2014-12-08 05:34:14	tadzik	if the order is known, ie you're always interested in the first one only then it's easy enough
2014-12-08 05:34:32	tadzik	if they're unpredictable, you may want to print out each elements that has more, just in case
2014-12-08 05:34:53	azizLIGHT	it is not standardized formatting in anyway, these rss entries
2014-12-08 05:35:01	tadzik	not really
2014-12-08 05:35:06	azizLIGHT	so yeah... looks like second option will have to be it
2014-12-08 05:35:12	azizLIGHT	the unpredictable mode
2014-12-08 05:35:20	tadzik	okay, you do your best and I gotta run
2014-12-08 05:35:32	azizLIGHT	alright, thanks for helping me tadzik
2014-12-08 05:35:34	tadzik	I'll be back in a couple hours and can help you finish that
2014-12-08 05:35:37	tadzik	you're welcome {:)

2014-12-08 06:43:31	Raven67854	DerRidda, Ending wealth doesn't end poverty.. Most likely people like stqn secretly want to keep the status qou anyway

2014-12-08 06:50:44	Raven67854	Beamboom, You know I feel as though I've seen the engine somewhere
2014-12-08 06:50:45	Raven67854	many years ago
2014-12-08 06:50:57	Raven67854	There was a java MMO engine that used JOGL
2014-12-08 06:51:01	Beamboom	It reminds me of something
2014-12-08 06:51:02	Raven67854	But I can't seem to place it's name
2014-12-08 06:51:04	gkeen_	Worm?
2014-12-08 06:51:07	Raven67854	No
2014-12-08 06:51:19	Raven67854	Beamboom, Could be entirely custom :p

2014-12-08 06:51:48	Beamboom	Could be, and hope it is, kinda, cause all java games using any of the common engines have pretty much sucked, graphically.
2014-12-08 06:52:03	Beamboom	But this looks very... Uhm... Last gen, to put it mildly.
2014-12-08 06:52:16	Beamboom	But that's only judgning from the screenshots

2014-12-08 06:52:33	Raven67854	Beamboom, custom
2014-12-08 06:52:41	Beamboom	Wonder why it seemingly is so hard to make stuff that looks good with java?
2014-12-08 06:52:49	Raven67854	Beamboom, It's not?
2014-12-08 06:52:54	Beamboom	Example?
2014-12-08 06:52:55	Raven67854	People just don't
2014-12-08 06:53:13	DerRidda	Asset quality is almost always completely unrelated to the engine.
2014-12-08 06:53:18	Raven67854	Indeed
2014-12-08 06:53:25	Raven67854	They also used GL1
2014-12-08 06:53:40	Beamboom	yes exactly that's what one should think. But well... Show me a good looking 3D java game
2014-12-08 06:54:03	DerRidda	Wakfu.
2014-12-08 06:54:09	DerRidda	2D but gorgeous.
2014-12-08 06:54:22	Beamboom	And the engines I've had a look at out there, all have *horrible* visuals in their *reference* projects
2014-12-08 06:54:23	Raven67854	Beamboom, Well if you use LWJGL or JOGL you can make the game look like anything
2014-12-08 06:54:45	Raven67854	Beamboom, FOSS engines aren't known for having shiny visuals in their reference projects
2014-12-08 06:54:50	Beamboom	Maybe anything more heavy bogs down the execution? I just don't get it.

2014-12-08 06:55:58	Raven67854	stqn, I really don't care what you say
2014-12-08 06:56:02	DerRidda	Also remember: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
2014-12-08 06:56:13	Beamboom	But I more talk about sheer visual quality, like anti aliasing, model rendering, particle effects, you know - all that stuff that lifts it up above the "minecraft" level graphics
2014-12-08 06:56:28	Raven67854	Beamboom, Well again it's not that you can't do it
2014-12-08 06:56:32	Raven67854	It's just that people don't

2014-12-08 06:56:39	Beamboom	indeed DerRidda, it's just sos trange that I've not yet seen a good looking Java 3D game.
2014-12-08 06:56:48	Raven67854	Beamboom, go make one
2014-12-08 06:56:50	stqn	Raven67854: if you don’t care, then don’t quote me.
2014-12-08 06:57:03	Raven67854	stqn, I do care that you think I should be shot for not being a poor person
2014-12-08 06:57:03	DerRidda	Java isn't used that often period.
2014-12-08 06:57:10	Raven67854	I just don't care that you're suddenly now taken out of context
2014-12-08 06:57:14	Raven67854	You didn't have an issue with it when you said it
2014-12-08 06:58:08	stqn	also being rich and not being poor are different things
2014-12-08 06:58:09	Beamboom	There was a time I did have some ideas, and since I do know some basic Java programming I did play with the idea, but was totally turned off by the lack of evidence that anything good could be made out of it.
2014-12-08 06:58:32	stqn	if you want to be rich it means you want other people to be poor
2014-12-08 06:59:08	Raven67854	stqn, Doesn't matter that isn't what you said. You literally said I deserve to be shot for not being poor.
2014-12-08 06:59:14	Raven67854	There's no escaping the idiocy of what you said
2014-12-08 06:59:22	stqn	no, as I just said, you’re confused
2014-12-08 06:59:30	@Samsai	communism, ho!
2014-12-08 06:59:41	DerRidda	Ah, the ages old false of understanding of economy as a zero sum game.
2014-12-08 07:00:18	Raven67854	stqn, I remember exactly what you said. You struck out with me when I told you I wasn't poor. Now that I've pointed it out to people you suddenly care what you said
2014-12-08 07:00:24	Raven67854	No apology weeks ago when you said it
2014-12-08 07:00:26	Raven67854	Hell still none now
2014-12-08 07:00:37	Raven67854	Me getting richer won't make people poorer
2014-12-08 07:00:49	Raven67854	I'm not the goverment
2014-12-08 07:00:54	Raven67854	I can't force money out of people
2014-12-08 07:00:54	stqn	Raven67854: no, I was reacting to you saying you wanted to be rich
2014-12-08 07:01:19	Raven67854	stqn, And yet that still involves you thinking I deserve to be shot
2014-12-08 07:01:53	Beamboom	Well don't we all, when it comes down to it. This planet would be better off without us.
2014-12-08 07:02:15	Raven67854	Beamboom, I don't appreciate fuckwits on IRC telling me I deserve to be shot for not wanting to be lazy and broke
2014-12-08 07:02:24	Raven67854	you should probably stay out of this
2014-12-08 07:03:06	Beamboom	I'd suggest we all stood out of this. I mean, really. This is a gaming channel.
2014-12-08 07:03:23	Beamboom	But my comment was meant light-hearted :)

People that says such things usually either have a problem communicating (not meant mean) or have some other issues that's non-relevant to the topic
2014-12-08 07:05:26	FutureSuture	yea. popped up yesterday somewhere, no idea what sort of news outlet slate is, though

2014-12-08 07:09:11	Raven67854	It's not that Java can't do it. It's just that people don't

2014-12-08 07:10:21	tadzik	isn't "Next gen" 720p with 30fps? :P
2014-12-08 07:10:37	Raven67854	tadzik, I dunno what next gen is anymore
2014-12-08 07:10:51	Beamboom	Ok it was a slightly decent demo, but not exactly smoothly animated, and it still has this jagged, unpolished look over it. But it'd be interesting to see a more realistic demo, like a flyby through a landscape with some fairly complex, animated objects.
2014-12-08 07:10:52	Raven67854	pretty sure if it's "next gen" it doesn't exist on consoles
2014-12-08 07:10:54	tadzik	it's still next gen in Poland, as XB1 isn't released yet, iirc
2014-12-08 07:11:03	tadzik	but everywhere else it's just current gen
2014-12-08 07:11:12	Raven67854	Beamboom, And thus your understanding of graphics programming is shown :P

2014-12-08 07:14:02	DerRidda	I was tossing the Leadwerks AI demo around in #steamlug and some people were dissing the engine for the quality of the assets used in that. Two completely unrelated things.

2014-12-08 07:14:12	DerRidda	But that's sadly how most people judge.

2014-12-08 07:14:46	Raven67854	Though to be fair I still think as of this moment Leadwerks 2 was more impressive than Leadwerks 3 in some cases
2014-12-08 07:14:47	Beamboom	I mean, the C# people have their Unity. Why wasn't there a "jUnity" around a long time ago already
2014-12-08 07:15:01	Raven67854	Beamboom, Unity is coded in C++ and uses C# for scripting

2014-12-08 07:16:51	Raven67854	If you want to change that by all means go and learn java and make the best java game ever
2014-12-08 07:17:05	Raven67854	DerRidda, Tjat
2014-12-08 07:17:08	DerRidda	And those use Lua or some engine specific scripting language.

2014-12-08 07:18:07	tadzik	maybe they're secretly working on it
2014-12-08 07:18:20	DerRidda	It is, might be on Leadwerks 3, so I doubt there will be a Linux version but Wine should work fine since it's OpenGL.

2014-12-08 07:30:41	DerRidda	Raven67854: I do.
2014-12-08 07:30:44	stqn	it was a while ago though
2014-12-08 07:30:58	Raven67854	DerRidda, anything interesting coming down the line soon?
2014-12-08 07:31:13	@Samsai	stqn, understandable, but i wish to use it and being single threaded kinda makes it unusable
2014-12-08 07:31:33	@Samsai	i guess i'm going to have to keep using libx264
2014-12-08 07:31:43	DerRidda	There's preliminary support for vehicles already in, no docs on that yet but you can already grab a working car of the workshop.
2014-12-08 07:31:43	Raven67854	Samsai, why would you use vp9 anyway
2014-12-08 07:31:47	Raven67854	specially if you dump on youtube
2014-12-08 07:31:57	@Samsai	Raven67854, vp encoders make smaller files
2014-12-08 07:32:04	DerRidda	Better CSG tools should be coming soon.
2014-12-08 07:32:14	DerRidda	Still no freaking full screen on Linux...
2014-12-08 07:32:20	Raven67854	DerRidda, Any performance improvements or the vegitation editor?
2014-12-08 07:32:27	Raven67854	He needs to use SDL2 and stop it with fucking x11
2014-12-08 07:32:38	Raven67854	Samsai, I haven't really noticed much of a difference
2014-12-08 07:32:57	DerRidda	I think there were some performance issues fixed along the way.
2014-12-08 07:33:14	@Samsai	Raven67854, well, you render everything with so high bitrates i wouldn't be surprised if the differences weren't big enough for you to notice
2014-12-08 07:33:30	DerRidda	But I just upgraded my CPU and that distrorts my point of view on that.
2014-12-08 07:33:30	Raven67854	Samsai, I suppose

2014-12-08 07:34:15	Raven67854	Leadwerks 2 had quite the impressive render
2014-12-08 07:34:20	@Samsai	but for my third world 1990s broadband file size matters
2014-12-08 07:34:44	Raven67854	Samsai, Upload over night with your 1mbps/s
2014-12-08 07:34:59	RavenholmDX	heyo
2014-12-08 07:35:01	@Samsai	Raven67854, don't want to keep my computer on during nights
2014-12-08 07:35:09	Raven67854	Samsai, You're just unreasonable

2014-12-08 07:35:20	Raven67854	Use your phone
2014-12-08 07:35:38	DerRidda	Haven't really paid attention to that.
2014-12-08 07:35:38	@Samsai	but the uploading interface on the phone is unreasonable

2014-12-08 07:36:38	@Samsai	maybe i should just take all my files to school with a laptop and upload them there with the school internet
2014-12-08 07:37:31	DerRidda	I think you we talked about the script editor actually having features now before. Other than that it's still limited but how much of a hack the whole BlitzMax+GTK2 plugin thing is.
2014-12-08 07:37:38	DerRidda	-you

2014-12-08 07:38:36	DerRidda	I think Josh is holding out for some kinda of translation tool that will be able to translate BMax projects to C++ or something.
2014-12-08 07:38:37	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, It's okay
2014-12-08 07:38:50	Raven67854	DerRidda, I think josh should just suck it up and stop using bmax
2014-12-08 07:38:55	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, depends on your hardware
2014-12-08 07:38:56	DerRidda	Geta  GUI lib and pull the entire editor in engine I say.
2014-12-08 07:39:12	RavenholmDX	Have they confirmed if W3 is coming to Linux Raven67854?
2014-12-08 07:39:13	Raven67854	DerRidda, he'd have to fix the fullscreen either way :P
2014-12-08 07:39:19	RavenholmDX	I remember hearing rumours of it

2014-12-08 07:39:30	Raven67854	So I dunno
2014-12-08 07:39:41	von	RavenholmDX, it runs for me, but at much, much lower fps than on windows
2014-12-08 07:39:50	DerRidda	I still like the APi but want to kick that editor half the time i use it.
2014-12-08 07:40:07	von	although it's not the worst fps drop compared to windows

2014-12-08 07:40:48	DerRidda	Strong single threaded CPU plus a good GPU I#d reckon.
2014-12-08 07:40:51	von	but I get 150 fps on windows and 30 on linux

2014-12-08 07:41:29	Raven67854	DerRidda, I got over 100 with my FX8350
2014-12-08 07:41:30	DerRidda	OpenGL doesn't do threading, that#s our biggest issue on Linux atm.
2014-12-08 07:41:46	Raven67854	Yeah it's a nightmare to do threading with opengl
2014-12-08 07:42:04	RavenholmDX	I'd presume we'll be getting alot more ports?

2014-12-08 10:13:15	@Samsai	hello SolarAquarion, don't think i've seen you before
2014-12-08 10:15:34	SolarAquarion	hi Samsai
2014-12-08 10:16:06	SolarAquarion	Samsai, first time here.
2014-12-08 10:16:23	@Samsai	SolarAquarion, in that case, welcome :)
2014-12-08 10:16:50	SolarAquarion	Samsai, kind of wondering what games do stuff like CSMT matter on
2014-12-08 10:17:24	@Samsai	SolarAquarion, you'd have to ask someone else, my wine knowledge is rather basic
2014-12-08 10:17:56	@Samsai	sobkas, you are the resident wine expert, could you enlighten us?
2014-12-08 10:18:24	stqn	I tried CSMT with Risen and the graphics were all broken
2014-12-08 10:18:29	stqn	missing scenery…
2014-12-08 10:18:58	stqn	but didn’t try on anything else

2014-12-08 10:19:08	SolarAquarion	there was a lot of patches recently
2014-12-08 10:19:20	stqn	ah, it was a couple months ago I think
2014-12-08 10:20:35	SolarAquarion	stqn, what i'm waiting for is the nouveau drivers to accept the gallium3D patches
2014-12-08 10:20:48	SolarAquarion	Direct3D9 working great on linux
2014-12-08 10:20:57	SolarAquarion	less things to jump over
2014-12-08 10:21:54	stqn	hm I installed Manjaro recently and by default it was using nouveau, there was a purple vertical line on the left of the screen…
2014-12-08 10:22:15	@Samsai	stqn, so you have that as well?
2014-12-08 10:22:16	stqn	so… I’m using nvidia, anyway.
2014-12-08 10:23:42	stqn	Samsai: yeah, it’s not that catastrophic but if I can not have it with another driver, I’d rather use that other driver. Any anyway afaik performance is not great for my GTX 660.

2014-12-08 10:24:18	@Samsai	stqn, yeah, without reclocking nouveau is basically useless on any hardware
2014-12-08 10:24:22	stqn	and the nvidia blob works fine, apart from making flash crash with hw accel.
2014-12-08 10:25:30	liamdawe	Samsai: if u think its ready go ahead
2014-12-08 10:26:20	@Samsai	liamdawe, it's out
2014-12-08 10:26:26	@Samsai	now the waiting game begins
2014-12-08 10:26:26	SolarAquarion	stqn, nouveau is kind of slow compared to mesa
2014-12-08 10:26:39	@Samsai	FutureSuture, you can now make your comment
2014-12-08 10:26:47	SolarAquarion	or development wise
2014-12-08 10:27:01	SolarAquarion	Samsai, comment about what?
2014-12-08 10:27:20	@Samsai	SolarAquarion, about bioshock infinite possibly being an eon port
2014-12-08 10:29:07	SolarAquarion	Samsai, a translation wrapper?
2014-12-08 10:29:16	@Samsai	SolarAquarion, yup
2014-12-08 10:29:19	SolarAquarion	It all depends on how many jumps it needs to go through
2014-12-08 10:29:29	@Samsai	probably just as many as witcher 2
2014-12-08 10:29:31	SolarAquarion	Eon -> OpenGL
2014-12-08 10:29:49	@Samsai	but of course nothing is confirmed yet
2014-12-08 10:30:14	stqn	SolarAquarion: uh? if by mesa you mean software rendering, then I doubt nouveau is slower than that. If not I don’t know what you mean.
2014-12-08 10:30:21	SolarAquarion	Samsai, the more layers it needs to pass through before it's rendered the worse it is
2014-12-08 10:30:31	@Samsai	SolarAquarion, indeed
2014-12-08 10:30:49	SolarAquarion	stqn, i mean how many patches are released on every new release cycle
2014-12-08 10:30:58	stqn	ah
2014-12-08 10:30:59	SolarAquarion	vs lts releases
2014-12-08 10:31:05	SolarAquarion	and what not
2014-12-08 10:31:10	SolarAquarion	like 10.4 is next
2014-12-08 10:31:22	SolarAquarion	which will feature some interesting patches
2014-12-08 10:31:31	FutureSuture	Samsai, it shows up as EON, despite being eON in the textfield, why?
2014-12-08 10:31:32	Leftmost	SolarAquarion, as I understand it, CSMT could improve thing for virtually any game that isn't CPU-limited.

2014-12-08 10:34:26	DrMcCoy	The xoreos article said "Xoreos" in the title

2014-12-08 10:35:42	DrMcCoy	They have
2014-12-08 10:35:52	DrMcCoy	jaycee said they're working on DirectX 10 and 11
2014-12-08 10:36:15	@Samsai	well, at least they won't have to compete with wine anymore
2014-12-08 10:36:21	DrMcCoy	Which is when I said they should FLOSS it, for the glory of the people
2014-12-08 10:36:36	Leftmost	I don't know that an article filled with pure speculation is a terribly useful article.
2014-12-08 10:36:44	DrMcCoy	But no, jaycee would have none of it
2014-12-08 10:36:57	wtf_	:/ they should make it open to wine
2014-12-08 10:37:01	wtf_	would be very helpful
2014-12-08 10:37:12	@Samsai	Leftmost, you are probably right
2014-12-08 10:37:15	Leftmost	It's their bread and butter. What possible motivation do they have for open sourcing it?
2014-12-08 10:37:33	wtf_	to win back people after shitty port?
2014-12-08 10:38:06	Leftmost	Win people back for what? They'd essentially be putting themselves out of work.

2014-12-08 10:40:13	Leftmost	Samsai, the actual stuff from the article is interesting, but—and please forgive me for saying so—it's not great journalism.
2014-12-08 10:40:55	@Samsai	Leftmost, i understand
2014-12-08 10:41:09	DrMcCoy	It is kinda muckraking-ish
2014-12-08 10:41:20	DrMcCoy	And jaycee is kinda being thrown under the bus
2014-12-08 10:41:43	Leftmost	Not trying to be a dick, just giving what I hope is constructive criticism.
2014-12-08 10:42:11	@Samsai	but like i said earlier, it was my time to be a paranoid freetard
2014-12-08 10:43:07	liamdawe	well, remember guys it is an editorial, and you should always take it as such that means it's opinion based :)
2014-12-08 10:43:33	Leftmost	liamdawe, that's fair, but it's not terribly clear that it's an editorial.
2014-12-08 10:44:01	liamdawe	how can we make it more clear Leftmost? the only tag it has is "Editorial"
2014-12-08 10:44:16	liamdawe	possibly something i can clear up in our new design if there's a good way
2014-12-08 10:44:30	von	when I complained about not having any more comics to read, someone here recommended me to read Sandman. I think I'm hooked. Thank you whomever did recommend me that. ^_^
2014-12-08 10:44:33	Leftmost	The tags aren't very prominent and aren't something I look at. I look at headlines.
2014-12-08 10:45:04	Leftmost	Some sort of indication at that level would be more clear.

2014-12-08 10:46:45	von	lol, I have completely forgot I have chat logs. I'll thank flesk later when he's online :)
2014-12-08 10:47:10	@Samsai	liamdawe, done
2014-12-08 10:47:33	@Samsai	maybe i should try following jaycee on twitter now
2014-12-08 10:47:49	liamdawe	Samsai: thanks
2014-12-08 10:47:52	Leftmost	Also, editors, I got an email from the devs for Three Fourths Home indicating that they'll be releasing Linux support when they launch on Steam. They also have a Kickstarter for a new game promising Linux support. Might be worth pinging them.
2014-12-08 10:48:55	DrMcCoy	Wait
2014-12-08 10:49:01	liamdawe	Leftmost: might be an idea to email that in, so we can keep a log of it

2014-12-08 11:33:07	tadzik	personally, I think posting this IRC conversation and censoring the nickname was a bit of a dick move
2014-12-08 11:33:17	@Samsai	no, you are blue
2014-12-08 11:33:27	DrMcCoy	I'm green!
2014-12-08 11:33:37	@Samsai	damn you
2014-12-08 11:33:43	DrMcCoy	Green is my favourite color!
2014-12-08 11:34:24	@Samsai	this is starting to look like a child's painting
2014-12-08 11:34:34	@Samsai	DerRidda, what colour do you want?
2014-12-08 11:34:52	DerRidda	Colour?
2014-12-08 11:35:26	@Samsai	yes, we are playing the game of "censor your irc nickname"
2014-12-08 11:35:35	@Samsai	so, which one will it be?
2014-12-08 11:35:43	DerRidda	Nyan Cat.

2014-12-08 11:41:52	tadzik	hello
2014-12-08 11:42:41	Kyrottimus	I have a potentially dumb question, and since apparently my search-fu has gone rogue today, here it is:  Why do linux Nvidia driver numbers fluctuate?  (go to like 343.xx then now newest supported like 340.xx)
2014-12-08 11:42:58	tadzik	yeah, I noticed that too
2014-12-08 11:43:11	tadzik	I think the newer one doesn't work with the newest kernel, so they rolled it back
2014-12-08 11:43:28	Kyrottimus	That's a perfectly logical reason
2014-12-08 11:43:29	mETz	there's a LTS release, that's 340.x I think
2014-12-08 11:43:36	tadzik	I updated my kernel, nvidia broke, then looked on nvidia.com for the newest driver and it was older than the one I had
2014-12-08 11:43:45	mETz	The newer ones probably just increase as usual
2014-12-08 11:43:55	Kyrottimus	ok, that makes sense, thanks guys!
2014-12-08 11:44:57	Kyrottimus	I'm on Mint 17 MATE 64 LTS and never upgraded my kernel (stuck with base default) and never noticed a prob with Nvidia drivers
2014-12-08 11:45:20	@Samsai	DrMcCoy, your nickname has now been censored
2014-12-08 11:45:35	Kyrottimus	speaking of drivers, Nvidia released a new one today so gonna install that
2014-12-08 11:45:42	NuSuey	damn, that SWTOR still starts up like 30 minutes after I run it from POL ..what the hell :o
2014-12-08 11:45:47	tadzik	the damage is done, but I think that irc conversation should not have been posted there
2014-12-08 11:46:06	Kyrottimus	I'll be back though, love the website btw Samsai, been a daily reader now for going on 6 months or so
2014-12-08 11:46:10	tadzik	it reduces the chance that devs may come here and "leak" information every now and then
2014-12-08 11:46:23	@Samsai	Kyrottimus, thank liamdawe, he's the boss
2014-12-08 11:46:27	liamdawe	they should never do that anyway tadzik
2014-12-08 11:46:37	Kyrottimus	Yeah but he's not in here xD
2014-12-08 11:46:40	liamdawe	Kyrottimus: i accept cake
2014-12-08 11:46:42	@Samsai	i'm just some random idiot with some video editing skills

2014-12-08 11:46:59	tadzik	well, clearly it's good for gol's business, looking at how there's an article on it
2014-12-08 11:47:04	NuSuey	tadzik: agree :o wouldn't post it as an article either
2014-12-08 11:47:07	Kyrottimus	Yes liamdawe, the website kicks ass

2014-12-08 11:48:31	@Samsai	tadzik, well, IMO they shouldn't come here to leak info anyway
2014-12-08 11:48:32	liamdawe	please don't

2014-12-08 11:48:55	@Samsai	this is a public place after all and who knows who's hiding behind these nicknames
2014-12-08 11:49:04	liamdawe	we tend to want less leaks, and more solid info anyway, so meh the less leaks the better overall
2014-12-08 11:49:13	mETz	I wonder how that fluffy thing would survive a shipping though

2014-12-08 12:16:49	@liamdawe	which is why we removed any names to be referenced
2014-12-08 12:16:58	@liamdawe	and again, irc is public chat,
2014-12-08 12:17:22	@liamdawe	public chat for a news site i might stress, so no one should be surprised when we use stuff in it
2014-12-08 12:17:54	BTRE	I personally wouldn't have written up the article but, yeah, I agree that the IRC stuff is fair game.
2014-12-08 12:18:48	BTRE	liamdawe you should make it clearer that it's an editorial. Either with something in the title or preceding the actual body of the article.
2014-12-08 12:19:05	@liamdawe	there's an editorial tag, and Samsai even mentions in the article directly
2014-12-08 12:19:16	BTRE	I can't help but feel a bit put off like I do with phoronix stuff
2014-12-08 12:19:16	@liamdawe	"To be clear with you guys, this is an editorial, meaning that it's an opinion piece. Please treat it as such."
2014-12-08 12:19:33	BTRE	Yeah, I know. But people get worked up easier.
2014-12-08 12:19:37	BTRE	*easily
2014-12-08 12:19:45	@liamdawe	gol has always run opinion pieces, and will always do so
2014-12-08 12:19:52	@liamdawe	i am very open about that
2014-12-08 12:19:55	BTRE	And that's fine.
2014-12-08 12:20:09	@liamdawe	it's how i run it, and will do so, i personally like to speculate as it's part of life

2014-12-08 12:21:15	@liamdawe	and the difference with phoronix, we use, link to, and include sources guys, please remember that
2014-12-08 12:21:25	BTRE	Man, I'm not saying anything against speculation in general. Just, to me, I think that a bit of clarity right away can help a lot.
2014-12-08 12:21:59	BTRE	Honestly the tags aren't as visible as the actual article title or the blurb.
2014-12-08 12:22:15	@liamdawe	"Prepare for some speculation." is right at the end of the blurb
2014-12-08 12:22:38	@liamdawe	i don't think we can get much clearer really, apart from adding speculation into the title
2014-12-08 12:23:48	@Samsai	on it
2014-12-08 12:24:12	@Samsai	can't be much clearer than that
2014-12-08 12:24:44	BTRE	liamdawe, other game sites often have their non-news articles marked "Editorial: whatever the title is"
2014-12-08 12:25:06	@liamdawe	i really should finish up those editor guidelines i was working on
2014-12-08 12:25:22	BTRE	or "opinion: whatever"
2014-12-08 12:25:33	BTRE	like so http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/04/07/editorial-the-difference-between-story-and-fiction.aspx

2014-12-08 12:26:51	@liamdawe	to our editor rules i will be putting up
2014-12-08 12:27:27	BTRE	Thanks for listening to my suggestion.
2014-12-08 12:27:57	@liamdawe	it was a valid suggestion :)
2014-12-08 12:29:50	BTRE	On another note, I've been wanting to submit more articles but I have no idea what to write about. You (GOL in general) are usually faster than me at sussing out news :)

2014-12-08 13:42:52	MisterBubbles	I wish there was a good native mmo for Linux.
2014-12-08 13:42:58	MisterBubbles	SotA is nice but not done yet

2014-12-08 13:43:45	MisterBubbles	I kickstarted SotA. I quite enjoy the game (though it has some issues on Intel/Linux) and I really look forward to it being done
2014-12-08 13:43:49	MisterBubbles	I am also a huge Ultima fan.
2014-12-08 13:44:03	stqn	ok, good, I guess…
2014-12-08 13:44:09	stqn	never played any ultima game myself
2014-12-08 13:44:30	MisterBubbles	Ultima 4 onward are all great games. 6 and onward are actually decently modern too.
2014-12-08 13:44:51	MisterBubbles	Ugh, tracker-store I love and hate you.
2014-12-08 13:45:06	stqn	I once installed ultima 6 I think (serpent’s isle?) but didn’t play for more than 5 minutes
2014-12-08 13:45:32	MisterBubbles	Ultima 7 - you gotta play it with Exult not the original dos version, bug fixes, features and scalers. Quite a nice experience
2014-12-08 13:45:38	MisterBubbles	Especially not having to deal with their voodoo memory manager
2014-12-08 13:45:47	stqn	yeah that was with exult probably.
2014-12-08 13:46:17	MisterBubbles	There is little hand holding so its a lot different from modern games
2014-12-08 13:46:27	stqn	But I’m not into top-down CRPGs…
2014-12-08 13:46:48	stqn	I prefer RPGs like Oblivion, Gothic…
2014-12-08 13:46:50	MisterBubbles	U7 definitely is hard to get into due to the weird isometric angle it has, 8 is a bit better.
2014-12-08 13:47:08	MisterBubbles	The Underworlds were first person and 9 was a third person game (pretty but probably the weakest with rpg elements in the series)
2014-12-08 13:47:29	huw	9 was crap
2014-12-08 13:48:02	MisterBubbles	I really enjoy 9 as long as I kind of ignore that its Ultima
2014-12-08 13:48:12	MisterBubbles	As a stand alone rpg its actually pretty good and feels fairly modern.
2014-12-08 13:48:27	MisterBubbles	I really wish they had released the isometric version of it, it looked so good.
2014-12-08 13:48:58	huw	kind of like the game equivalent of Alien Ressurection then? ignore that it's part of the Alien series and it's not a bad film? :)
2014-12-08 13:49:31	MisterBubbles	Its got some nice references and stuff - but it ignores a lot of canon and has some stupid stuff because they tried to make it more general for everyone.
2014-12-08 13:49:41	huw	er, resurrection. christ did i really just spell that incorrectly? :/
2014-12-08 13:49:53	MisterBubbles	"What is a Paladin?" at one point is the infamous example.

2014-12-08 13:57:29	stqn	well actually I did use fedora core a little bit a few years ago at work. Was ok, apart from SELinux.

2014-12-08 17:41:50	Happy-Ferret	I essentially have to kill tint2 and wbar whenever they're not in use and re-instate them via xdotool whenever I move to the edges of the screen.

2014-12-09 01:57:59	Beamboom	So, any scandals today? :)
2014-12-09 01:58:23	von	nothing interesting happens this early
2014-12-09 01:59:51	tadzik	just you wait
2014-12-09 01:59:59	Beamboom	That's what I've always said. So why do we even bother geting up this early! All action happens in the evenings! ;)
2014-12-09 02:00:36	Beamboom	Any of you guys happen to be into composing/music making too?
2014-12-09 02:01:10	RavenholmDX	I am Beamboom
2014-12-09 02:01:15	RavenholmDX	not as much as I'd like
2014-12-09 02:01:19	Beamboom	I'm just so totally excited over professional VSTs out there now getting ported to Linux. Things happen on that field too now!
2014-12-09 02:01:52	Beamboom	Ah cool RavenholmDX! What software do you use, and on Linux?
2014-12-09 02:01:56	RavenholmDX	Yeah, I've noticed. I don't do a whole lot of digital recording/production
2014-12-09 02:02:17	RavenholmDX	mainly acoustic recording
2014-12-09 02:02:23	Beamboom	Ah you're the good ole' analogue instrument kinda guy :) Cool
2014-12-09 02:02:33	RavenholmDX	Haha yeah
2014-12-09 02:02:51	RavenholmDX	I do a bit of work in post sometimes
2014-12-09 02:02:56	RavenholmDX	but rarely
2014-12-09 02:03:10	Beamboom	I got an el-guitar sitting in the corner in my room, staring at me, asking "so, when yo gonna stop playing around and pick me up?!"
2014-12-09 02:03:12	RavenholmDX	and for that something like Krystal or Audacity is fine
2014-12-09 02:03:25	RavenholmDX	Mine is saying the exact same thing :P
2014-12-09 02:03:36	Beamboom	haha
2014-12-09 02:04:10	RavenholmDX	Don't really get much time to play as I used to in school/college
2014-12-09 02:04:35	RavenholmDX	right now it seems to be work > relationship > tech/gaming hobbies > music for me
2014-12-09 02:04:52	Beamboom	And just like Valve paved way for gaming on Linux, it's the new DAW Bitwig who did the same for music on Linux, I recon.
2014-12-09 02:04:53	RavenholmDX	should probably be relationship > * , but you know how it goes :P
2014-12-09 02:05:11	Beamboom	That's my list too, man. Dude, it's life.
2014-12-09 02:05:44	RavenholmDX	haha
2014-12-09 02:05:47	RavenholmDX	sure is
2014-12-09 02:05:51	RavenholmDX	what IRC client do you use?
2014-12-09 02:06:09	Beamboom	But right now I at least temporary put gaming a bit aside to play around with some *sick* synths from u-he that's out in beta builds now
2014-12-09 02:06:14	Tag_	early?
2014-12-09 02:06:22	Tag_	man, it's 11
2014-12-09 02:06:23	Beamboom	I use xchat-gnome

2014-12-09 02:06:43	tadzik	I should fix timezone on my server
2014-12-09 02:06:44	RavenholmDX	ah is that a full GTK version of xchat?
2014-12-09 02:07:01	Beamboom	Yes that's exactly what it is
2014-12-09 02:07:11	RavenholmDX	oh nice, might need to check it out
2014-12-09 02:07:12	Tag_	5:06... are you at NY or similar tadzik?
2014-12-09 02:07:20	tadzik	Beamboom: I was listening to what could be classified as Nintendo Rock yesterday, and I thought "I wonder if I could do that"
2014-12-09 02:07:22	Beamboom	Taddy is in poland!
2014-12-09 02:07:27	tadzik	Tag_: no, Warsaw Poland
2014-12-09 02:07:40	tadzik	the timezone on the server must be borked (server is in Amsterdam)
2014-12-09 02:07:44	Tag_	ah
2014-12-09 02:07:50	Tag_	ok ok
2014-12-09 02:08:25	Beamboom	Seriously, the workflow of Bitwig is just fantastic, if you've never worked with a sequencer before you do need an introduction but from there it's just to blast on.
2014-12-09 02:09:44	Beamboom	And some of those professional synths are just... Wow. So rich sound, so crisp, so full of oomph, I just sit there pressing the keys thinking "it's impossible to NOT make anything good with this!" :D

2014-12-09 02:18:15	Leftmost	My guitar just has a broken nut, but it's a crap guitar and probably not worth the cost of repairing it.
2014-12-09 02:19:36	tadzik	luthier holds mine for so long that he promised that he won't take any money from me
2014-12-09 02:19:45	tadzik	but still, I'd rather pay him and finally get it back
2014-12-09 02:20:03	Beamboom	tadzik, yes you can, depending on your audio card really
2014-12-09 02:20:21	Beamboom	and the inputs
2014-12-09 02:20:29	tadzik	I have a piano with a usb port that plays MIDI
2014-12-09 02:20:38	NuSuey	wanted to buy rocksmith (2014) for myself .. I will buy it, provided that I'll finish at least 3 website projects .. status so far 0 out of 3 :(
2014-12-09 02:21:03	tadzik	heh, my hotel this week reminded me of one website project I wanted to make. It's callled Free Wifi Offenders
2014-12-09 02:21:19	tadzik	Yesterday it took 2.5 hours to download a 30 minute long youtube video
2014-12-09 02:21:23	Beamboom	tadzik, then you got what you need.
2014-12-09 02:21:28	NuSuey	lol
2014-12-09 02:21:39	tadzik	now I'm at work downloading everything I may want to watch later :P
2014-12-09 02:21:50	tadzik	seriously, it goes as low as 15 KB/s
2014-12-09 02:22:21	Leftmost	NuSuey, I was trying to play when I discovered a) I had to pull a panel off to tighten the tremolo springs so it'd stay in tune and b) the nut is broken so the low E is always one fret off.
2014-12-09 02:22:28	Beamboom	NuSuey, I got Rocksmith (the first) but have barely used it. It had a *horrible* latency on the guitar. It was unbearable
2014-12-09 02:22:53	Beamboom	at least on ,y system
2014-12-09 02:23:03	tadzik	the one I played on the xbox had a noticable latency too, I think they recommend plugging it to the amp first and then passing it to the console
2014-12-09 02:23:07	tadzik	so at least the sound you hear is right
2014-12-09 02:23:36	NuSuey	what I heard is that the latency is good at pc, bad at ps3/xbox console
2014-12-09 02:23:43	Beamboom	yes I know, that's what they do recommend, but I could not be bothered.
2014-12-09 02:23:54	Beamboom	I got rocksmith on PC, it was really very bad.
2014-12-09 02:24:11	Beamboom	But I guess it would depend on your system too, I guess. Or something.
2014-12-09 02:24:20	NuSuey	really? I only read/heard good things about it
2014-12-09 02:24:38	Beamboom	It was so bad that I thought there was something wrong. And maybe it is.
2014-12-09 02:24:48	Leftmost	I had no latency issues. Just the damn broken guitar. :-P
2014-12-09 02:25:19	Beamboom	On PC? Well then it *is* something wrong with my machine then, cause we talk about a latency as big as maybe 1/4th of a second
2014-12-09 02:25:37	DerRidda	Latency is highly dependent on hardware and software, there is no baseline you can expect across systems.
2014-12-09 02:27:01	RavenholmDX	Yeah, I had no issues with Rocksmith
2014-12-09 02:27:08	RavenholmDX	I wasn't using an official cable though
2014-12-09 02:27:23	RavenholmDX	picked it up on steam cheap, and just used the patch cable hack
2014-12-09 02:28:06	DerRidda	Does it work in Wine with any of these setups?
2014-12-09 02:28:13	RavenholmDX	That was in Windows
2014-12-09 02:28:32	RavenholmDX	I can imagine Wine would introduce all sorts of latency issues
2014-12-09 02:29:18	DerRidda	WineASIO is a thing, how good of a thing i couldn't tell.
2014-12-09 02:35:34	RavenholmDX	not a fan of Wine at all
2014-12-09 02:35:45	RavenholmDX	granted I haven't touched it in years, and don't intend to
2014-12-09 02:36:06	RavenholmDX	give me native or give me death :P
2014-12-09 02:36:22	RavenholmDX	I don't even like using Android apps on my Jolla :P
2014-12-09 02:44:32	von	isn't Rocksmith a Uplay game?
2014-12-09 02:45:12	RavenholmDX	2014 is
2014-12-09 02:45:18	RavenholmDX	not sure about the original
2014-12-09 02:45:35	von	I was considering it, but getting the cable was a drag
2014-12-09 02:45:39	von	and then linux gaming happened
2014-12-09 02:45:44	RavenholmDX	von, someone made a patch
2014-12-09 02:45:57	RavenholmDX	to let you use any 3.5mm cable
2014-12-09 02:45:58	stuartm	emulation is always going to be a second-best option, an inelegant 'hack'
2014-12-09 02:46:28	RavenholmDX	It's not emulation, it just tells the game to look at your microphone instead of the USB cable
2014-12-09 02:46:34	RavenholmDX	worked perfectly for me
2014-12-09 02:46:52	von	software amplification
2014-12-09 02:46:54	von	:<
2014-12-09 02:47:10	RavenholmDX	well the original cable would be the same too
2014-12-09 02:47:10	von	also line in, not mic
2014-12-09 02:47:31	RavenholmDX	I did it through the mic
2014-12-09 02:47:32	stuartm	RavenholmDX: referring to Wine
2014-12-09 02:47:48	RavenholmDX	ah, yeah stuartm
2014-12-09 02:48:05	von	wine is not an emulator
2014-12-09 02:48:07	von	;)
2014-12-09 02:48:19	Morgawr	^ this is bait
2014-12-09 02:48:21	Morgawr	:P
2014-12-09 02:48:24	stuartm	heh, indeed
2014-12-09 02:48:39	RavenholmDX	I mean, I guess it's good wine is a thing
2014-12-09 02:48:47	RavenholmDX	but I'm sure it kept games off the platform
2014-12-09 02:49:14	Morgawr	how so?
2014-12-09 02:49:18	RavenholmDX	Like when EVE was pulled originally, didn't they pretty much say 'Well, you can play it with Wine?'
2014-12-09 02:49:48	stuartm	RavenholmDX: well the subject's been argued to death, but I side with the view that it's existence just encourages laziness
2014-12-09 02:50:08	RavenholmDX	well yeah stuartm, that's what I mean really
2014-12-09 02:50:24	RavenholmDX	why would a developer bother, if users can get it running on Wine
2014-12-09 02:50:51	tadzik	shipping is one thing, support is another
2014-12-09 02:50:55	von	some devs even made effort to make their games more compatible with wine
2014-12-09 02:51:09	Beamboom	Well, I *can't* get it to work in Wine, so there :)
2014-12-09 02:51:10	tadzik	I'll be okay if devs said "you can play it with wine and we'll report the bugs you find"
2014-12-09 02:51:13	Morgawr	von: like GGG and PoE
2014-12-09 02:51:54	von	I'm fairly sure I've read somewhere that before Source had linux support, devs at Valve were patching it to work better on wine
2014-12-09 02:52:20	RavenholmDX	Would make sense
2014-12-09 02:52:21	von	now I'm sad VS:AC does not work on wine anymore :<
2014-12-09 02:52:25	RavenholmDX	Source games always ran great
2014-12-09 02:52:57	stuartm	tadzik: that only works if the Wine team had the time and knowledge of Windows internals to fix all those bugs, they do their best but ultimately it's a nearly impossible task without cooperation from Microsoft
2014-12-09 02:53:02	stuartm	shifting sands
2014-12-09 02:53:11	Morgawr	usually wine can find bugs that are actually your bugs but most drivers and setups hide and fix in a non-standard way, so imo fixing games to work well in wine also means your game gets better code in the long run
2014-12-09 02:53:13	von	is GameMaker a good engine btw? VS:AC developer struggles to make it work on OSX as of now
2014-12-09 02:53:33	tadzik	stuartm: I'm not talking about wine team, I'm talking about the original game devs :)
2014-12-09 02:53:49	tadzik	as in: "you say it works with wine, will you fix your game if it doesn't?"
2014-12-09 02:53:59	Morgawr	I've only had pains with a lot of gamemaker games, lots of bugs and issues... but that may be because of the average developer using game maker and not the engine per se
2014-12-09 02:54:08	Leftmost	Someone please send me a pickup for an acoustic guitar, since I'm too cheap to fix the electric or buy my own pickup.
2014-12-09 02:54:34	tadzik	pickup?
2014-12-09 02:55:08	Morgawr	like a truck :P
2014-12-09 02:55:17	stuartm	tadzik: the problems aren't in the original game, they are in Wine
2014-12-09 02:55:54	tadzik	well, I guess we have a different perspective on things
2014-12-09 02:55:56	stuartm	and the original game devs aren't going to want to start working on fixing someone else's bugs
2014-12-09 02:56:46	tadzik	what I mean is: if I am to buy a game from someone who says that I can play it in wine, I expect the same customer support as if I was running it on windows
2014-12-09 02:56:57	von	^
2014-12-09 02:56:59	von	that
2014-12-09 02:57:11	RavenholmDX	Not many developers are going to say that though
2014-12-09 02:57:16	tadzik	if the game broke on windows I won't be nagging Microsoft about it, what do they care? They're not the ones who claim something works and collect money for it
2014-12-09 02:57:21	RavenholmDX	and if they do, they'll append 'but your mileage my vary'
2014-12-09 02:57:26	Morgawr	stuartm: sometimes the problems are in the original game, sometimes they are in wine. I've honestly seen a fair share of both
2014-12-09 02:57:30	Beamboom	So why isn't Tales from the Borderlands for Linux too? According to the reviews it's epic! Man, the Borderlands IP expands at a steady rate!
2014-12-09 02:57:33	tadzik	well, System Shock 2 did that :)
2014-12-09 02:57:38	Leftmost	tadzik, it's a piece of electronic equipment that fits into an acoustic to do basically what pickups do on an electric.
2014-12-09 02:57:46	stuartm	tadzik: even after decades of development, if you run Wine from the console you'll see it spewing a LOT of warnings about unimplemented APIs etc, Wine is not and probably never will be a complete emulation of the Windows environment
2014-12-09 02:57:50	RavenholmDX	Beamboom: Telltale haven't done a Linux game yet have they?
2014-12-09 02:57:52	tadzik	Leftmost: I still don't know what pickups are :P
2014-12-09 02:58:00	stuartm	Morgawr: if they are in the original game they'd manifest on Windows as well
2014-12-09 02:58:06	Morgawr	stuartm: just put WINEDEBUG=-all :P
2014-12-09 02:58:11	von	RavenholmDX, no, they haven't
2014-12-09 02:58:14	Morgawr	stuartm: not necessarily
2014-12-09 02:58:16	tadzik	stuartm: I still don't see how that's related :)
2014-12-09 02:58:18	RavenholmDX	tadzik: they're the electronic component of a guitar that allows you to amplify the sound
2014-12-09 02:58:23	tadzik	ah, okay
2014-12-09 02:58:29	tadzik	"przetworniki" :P
2014-12-09 02:58:30	stuartm	tadzik: see my response to Morgawr
2014-12-09 02:58:31	von	Beamboom, RavenholmDX, but their games work very well on wine.
2014-12-09 02:58:32	Beamboom	RavenholmDX, not yet, but 2k got some good porters as we know. Its their IP after all!
2014-12-09 02:58:42	Leftmost	I am bad at defining things.
2014-12-09 02:58:44	Morgawr	some bugs appear because wine devs follow specific standardized API and sometimes driver developers and windows implementations actually are not working how they are supposed to work
2014-12-09 02:58:44	RavenholmDX	tadzik is polish?
2014-12-09 02:58:46	tadzik	stuartm: as I say, we look at things differently
2014-12-09 02:58:48	tadzik	RavenholmDX: yes
2014-12-09 02:58:53	RavenholmDX	I love the Witcher
2014-12-09 02:58:56	tadzik	:D
2014-12-09 02:58:59	RavenholmDX	Wiedzmin actually :P
2014-12-09 02:59:03	tadzik	yeah, Wiedźmin :)
2014-12-09 02:59:06	tadzik	did you read the books?
2014-12-09 02:59:07	von	<3
2014-12-09 02:59:11	von	I love teh books
2014-12-09 02:59:21	RavenholmDX	the first two tadzik
2014-12-09 02:59:21	von	especially the first two, with short stories
2014-12-09 02:59:23	Leftmost	I want to read the books, but it's hard to know where to start given that not all of them are translated.
2014-12-09 02:59:31	tadzik	the new one is pretty good too, not sure if it's translated already
2014-12-09 02:59:31	stuartm	Morgawr: right, but Wine is meant to be emulating Windows as it really is, not an idealised version of it
2014-12-09 02:59:49	RavenholmDX	The community translations of the Witcher books are supposed to be pretty good
2014-12-09 02:59:55	tadzik	Leftmost: the saga is probably quite complete
2014-12-09 02:59:57	stuartm	that includes Windows API oddities and bugs
2014-12-09 03:00:03	tadzik	Leftmost: so start with The Blood of Elves
2014-12-09 03:00:26	Leftmost	Okay.
2014-12-09 03:00:34	von	tadzik, wait wat
2014-12-09 03:00:38	tadzik	I remember seeing the whole collection in English in Outland in Oslo, it looked really nice
2014-12-09 03:00:38	von	there are moar books?
2014-12-09 03:00:44	tadzik	von: there are about 8 or 9
2014-12-09 03:00:50	tadzik	I think
2014-12-09 03:00:52	stuartm	which is why I say the task is pointless, and a waste of resources - I'd much rather see the devs contributing their time to more worthwhile ventures
2014-12-09 03:00:57	Morgawr	stuartm: wine is meant to implement window APIs as a compatibility layer, it's not meant to strictly emulate "windows"
2014-12-09 03:01:18	tadzik	von: 2 or 3 with short stories, the saga and now the newest one, Season of Storms or something
2014-12-09 03:01:23	von	ah, there's Sezon burz
2014-12-09 03:01:25	tadzik	right
2014-12-09 03:01:36	von	DO WANT
2014-12-09 03:01:56	tadzik	I can lend it to you, if you can read Polish :P
2014-12-09 03:01:59	stuartm	Wine = Windows Emulator (before they later changed it to that stupid back-cronym)
2014-12-09 03:02:03	von	I cannot
2014-12-09 03:02:10	Morgawr	stuartm: sure, but that doesn't change what I said
2014-12-09 03:02:11	tadzik	dang'
2014-12-09 03:02:13	von	and Polish is too far from Russian to even attempt lol
2014-12-09 03:02:17	tadzik	heh
2014-12-09 03:02:35	tadzik	I can usually talk with Russians when both of us speak their language
2014-12-09 03:02:39	von	I could have tried reading in Ukrainian or Belorussian, but western slavic languages is another story entirely
2014-12-09 03:02:41	tadzik	most of the message gets through
2014-12-09 03:02:53	tadzik	reading doesn't work, obviously
2014-12-09 03:03:02	von	yeah, but the funny thing is
2014-12-09 03:03:09	RavenholmDX	If Microsoft were to open the DX APIs, would you want them ported to Linux?
2014-12-09 03:03:10	von	the words may sound similarly
2014-12-09 03:03:13	von	but have different meanings
2014-12-09 03:03:51	von	there was that article about translating from Polish to Russian in one of the Witcher books with examples of that
2014-12-09 03:03:58	von	I'll look it up later
2014-12-09 03:04:20	stuartm	but I'd argue that Windows developers (developers of windows applications) don't care about those things, if it works on Windows they'll expect it to work with Wine, trying to tell them that they are mis-using Window's APIs is going to be a waste of time (in my experience, you can't always convince Linux developers to use APIs properly)

2014-12-09 03:05:13	von	preorder for the book is  open
2014-12-09 03:05:27	von	will be released in Russian 27.12
2014-12-09 03:06:01	von	too bad the translator of the previous books has died, will probably get worse quality or unfamiliar names =/
2014-12-09 03:06:28	stuartm	RavenholmDX: difficult to say, probably not. Microsoft have a long history of laying traps - so they open up DX11 - linux embraces the DX apis, what then happens when they refuse to do the same for DX12 - do all those applications which used the DX API on linux have to start again from scratch with OpenGL, OpenAL etc?
2014-12-09 03:06:38	RavenholmDX	I'm sure the community will fix them up if that's the case von
2014-12-09 03:07:16	von	I sure hope so
2014-12-09 03:07:17	stuartm	"Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" is a tired cliche, but that doesn't mean it's not true

2014-12-09 03:07:38	von	tadzik, I once tried to learn some Python. ONCE.
2014-12-09 03:07:43	RavenholmDX	them opening up DX12 wouldn't surprise me
2014-12-09 03:07:50	RavenholmDX	after they openened up the .NET core
2014-12-09 03:08:23	tadzik	von: well, I'm mostly raging about the url parsing library
2014-12-09 03:08:37	von	but the sad thing about python is
2014-12-09 03:08:50	tadzik	here I sit, staring at the profiler output, wondering how on earch is parsing the URL so cheap but checking the .hostname of one so expensive
2014-12-09 03:09:06	tadzik	and it turns out it's not actually parsed, it parses it anew on each call to .hostname
2014-12-09 03:09:14	tadzik	every fucking tiem
2014-12-09 03:09:20	von	out of all interpreted programming languages Python is probably the best for cv
2014-12-09 03:09:39	von	it's insanely popular for some reason
2014-12-09 03:10:16	stuartm	RavenholmDX: 'new' Microsoft just torpedoed Nokia by sending in one of their own executives undercover to destroy the company from the inside, I'll wait and see whether 'new' Microsoft is anything but a ploy to encourage people to use their tools only to pull the rug
2014-12-09 03:10:35	RavenholmDX	stuartm: in fairness, Nokia torpedoed Nokia
2014-12-09 03:10:58	RavenholmDX	they couldn't keep up with the advances in mobile technologies
2014-12-09 03:11:13	RavenholmDX	And I say that as a Jolla user
2014-12-09 03:11:16	stuartm	Nokia was in a bad place true, but it only got a lot worse under Elop
2014-12-09 03:11:52	RavenholmDX	IMO, the purchase didn't really make sense
2014-12-09 03:12:25	RavenholmDX	They pretty much just wanted the Nokia hardware team
2014-12-09 03:12:34	stuartm	anyway, if Microsoft doesn't launch a closed platform called .Net+ in two or three years I might start to change my mind about them, until then I'll be staying well clear of MS technologies
2014-12-09 03:13:13	stuartm	RavenholmDX: that much was clear when Elop drove out the Software teams
2014-12-09 03:13:48	RavenholmDX	stuartm: the best thing to come out of Nokia is Jolla IMO
2014-12-09 03:13:56	RavenholmDX	SailfishOS is a great mobile OS
2014-12-09 03:14:20	RavenholmDX	just wish it had more traction
2014-12-09 03:15:21	stuartm	aye, alternatives to Android would be great, not a huge fan of Google's business model
2014-12-09 03:15:31	RavenholmDX	stuartm: that's why I moved away
2014-12-09 03:15:41	RavenholmDX	I had *everything* under Google
2014-12-09 03:16:05	RavenholmDX	Every contact, every photo I've ever taken, my web history, every search I've ran
2014-12-09 03:16:17	RavenholmDX	started to split all that stuff up across providers
2014-12-09 03:16:35	RavenholmDX	sadly, the only suitable cloud storage is Dropbox (affordable, for 1TB)
2014-12-09 03:16:47	RavenholmDX	but at least it has a native Dropbox app
2014-12-09 03:17:44	stuartm	it's impossible to avoid Google entirely anymore, almost every single Website hosts Google content (Analytics, Javascript, adverts etc), Google is the most invasive data gathering tool ever created - makes the NSA, GCHQ look like amateurs
2014-12-09 03:18:16	RavenholmDX	I use Adblock and Disconnect, so hopefully alot of that stuff doesn't track me

2014-12-09 03:19:33	RavenholmDX	oh cool
2014-12-09 03:19:56	von	RavenholmDX, why not get your own server and host your files there?
2014-12-09 03:20:19	von	ownCloud or syncthing can do about the same job as Dropbox
2014-12-09 03:21:05	RavenholmDX	von, I want to keep data remotely
2014-12-09 03:21:18	RavenholmDX	and I haven't found an ownCloud provider as cheap as Dropbox
2014-12-09 03:21:45	stuartm	I favour the local option, I backup all my fires to an external drive which is stored in a fireproof safe - nothing of mine is stored offsite
2014-12-09 03:21:52	RavenholmDX	I guess putting stuff online anywhere, you need to forfeit some right to privacy (even if you shouldn't have to)

2014-12-09 04:00:54	RavenholmDX	Witcher is a pretty difficult game on Normal
2014-12-09 04:01:11	RavenholmDX	especially if you don't experiment with alchemy a whole bunch
2014-12-09 04:01:16	Leftmost	There are some fights that are surprisingly hard on Easy, even.
2014-12-09 04:01:24	RavenholmDX	yeah I can imagine

2014-12-09 04:06:03	RavenholmDX	do they really need those Ubuntu compatability files?

2014-12-09 04:08:17	RavenholmDX	well it looks like they could slim it down
2014-12-09 04:08:27	RavenholmDX	has a steam-runtime and a steam-runtime.old
2014-12-09 04:08:39	RavenholmDX	and also an archived version of the steam-runtime
2014-12-09 04:09:18	DerRidda	I don't know if the old one can be safely deleted.
2014-12-09 04:09:43	RavenholmDX	probably not
2014-12-09 04:10:10	RavenholmDX	I don't think it's a previous copy
2014-12-09 04:10:20	RavenholmDX	seems like it might be used for compatability with older games
2014-12-09 04:10:24	Leftmost	I am going to make a desperate play. I am going to try to run Costume Quest in wine on Christmas.
2014-12-09 04:10:33	RavenholmDX	why?
2014-12-09 04:11:15	Leftmost	Because there's an achievement for playing it on Christmas, but that achievement is known not to work on Linux. (I tried last year.)

2014-12-09 04:57:55	stuartm	wish Double Fine would try as hard as they did with Psychonauts for some original games, their latest releases (Costume Quest 2!?) are just a bit lame
2014-12-09 04:58:43	Cheeseness	Costume Quest 1 was apparently well loved enough to warrant a sequel
2014-12-09 04:58:47	stuartm	remakes/reduxes of classic point and clicks aside which are welcome, though hardly ground breaking
2014-12-09 05:00:08	stuartm	Cheeseness: found it very repetitive personally, but the same can be said for a lot of RPGs, maybe I'm just being unfair
2014-12-09 05:00:46	Cheeseness	It's not my favourite game, but CQ2 does deepen the gameplay a bit more than the original
2014-12-09 05:01:42	Cheeseness	I don't know if groundbreaking is the right word, but Hack 'n' Slash was pretty unusual and thought provoking (I'm pretty sure people haven't unlocked all the game has to offer yet)
2014-12-09 05:03:02	von	Hack'n'Slash is nice indeed
2014-12-09 05:03:10	von	also got stuck in it :<

2014-12-09 05:03:32	von	but I love the concept of the game
2014-12-09 05:04:49	Cheeseness	I didn't play Psychonauts until it came out for Linux. Was it groundbreaking when it was released? I thought the thing that made it special was the story

2014-12-09 05:07:38	stuartm	Psychonauts wasn't ground breaking no, but of all the Double Fine games it feels like the one they put the most work into, it was a well imagined story and world
2014-12-09 05:07:59	RavenholmDX	I really loved Brutal Legend
2014-12-09 05:08:04	RavenholmDX	I think it's fairly underrated
2014-12-09 05:08:11	stuartm	an AAA game before they slipped into more indie type stuff
2014-12-09 05:08:43	Cheeseness	They got into indie stuff to get out of the publisher dependency cycle. I think that once they have a bit more control over their future they'll return to larger scale stuff
2014-12-09 05:08:45	Beamboom	Brutal Legend was awesome until it turned into a strategy-kinda game.
2014-12-09 05:08:54	Beamboom	It should have been a hack'n'slash!
2014-12-09 05:08:59	RavenholmDX	Beamboom: I didn't mind the RTS parts
2014-12-09 05:09:08	RavenholmDX	somepeople seemed to really dislike them though
2014-12-09 05:09:12	RavenholmDX	reminded me alot of Overlord
2014-12-09 05:09:20	stuartm	Brutal Legend was good, still haven't completed it - got stuck near the end in one of the battles - although again at times it was a little repetitive, could have used some more variety in side missions for example
2014-12-09 05:09:34	RavenholmDX	It does have it's problems
2014-12-09 05:09:39	Beamboom	The beginning was total awesomeness, and then the underlings was added and I was like, "nooooooo... Please, return to what it looked to be!"
2014-12-09 05:09:39	RavenholmDX	but they built a great world
2014-12-09 05:09:42	Cheeseness	I don't mind it either, but I think it's definitely got a lot of room for improvement. The game runs pretty sluggish for me on Linux which makes the guitar solos pretty hard to pull off
2014-12-09 05:09:45	RavenholmDX	I enjoyed being in it
2014-12-09 05:09:55	RavenholmDX	Cheeseness: I haven't played on Linux

2014-12-09 05:10:17	stuartm	the RTS bit was a little weak, the controls ...

2014-12-10 03:01:29	Beamboom	I'd fully expect you to be at *leat* ten years older
2014-12-10 03:01:32	gkeen	How old are you then Beamboom ?
2014-12-10 03:01:38	Beamboom	least*
2014-12-10 03:01:45	Beamboom	I'm 45! :)
2014-12-10 03:02:11	Beamboom	I was born before man had taken his first tep on the moon.

2014-12-10 03:02:54	gkeen	Beamboom: so you experienced all the computer greatness then? :D
2014-12-10 03:03:37	Beamboom	But I thought you were older mainly because you travela  lot in your work tadzik, secondly because you are a sensible man. Not many 20-something I can say that about. :p
2014-12-10 03:04:10	Beamboom	I did experience the magnetic tape period indeed. I'd not call it greatness though. Far from it :D
2014-12-10 03:04:36	tadzik	*blush8
2014-12-10 03:04:53	tadzik	I wouldn't expect you to be 45 either :o
2014-12-10 03:04:56	tadzik	34, *maybe*
2014-12-10 03:05:14	Beamboom	I STILL remember the sensation of advancing to floppies, a data storage medium who actually were pretty much guaranteed to be readable
2014-12-10 03:05:52	Beamboom	One of the most significant upgrades ever, in my data life

2014-12-10 03:40:34	Beamboom	She enjoyed LittleBigPlanet on the PS3.
2014-12-10 03:42:11	Beamboom	Hehe - just to mess up that "age" picture further: The age difference between my wifes mother and I are actually much less than my wife and I. So generationally speaking I should have been dating her mum instead
2014-12-10 03:43:48	tadzik	:D
2014-12-10 03:44:17	tadzik	yeah, girl gamers are still hard to get by
2014-12-10 03:44:21	tadzik	although I did met a few
2014-12-10 03:44:30	tadzik	one in TF2, one in CSGO
2014-12-10 03:44:39	tadzik	the latter turned out to live a few blocks away

2014-12-10 03:45:33	tadzik	when I play tf2 lobbies, there's a girl on mumble like once every 2 games, so 1/18 chance
2014-12-10 03:46:19	Beamboom	that's pretty cool!
2014-12-10 03:46:31	tadzik	not *that* bad :P

2014-12-10 03:47:36	Beamboom	actually come to think of it there was also a couple of female gamers in the Unreal Tournament clan I was a member of years ago. But they were, of course(?), in relationship with a guy in that clan too
2014-12-10 03:47:45	tadzik	it might be higher percentage than in IT
2014-12-10 03:48:10	Beamboom	So THAT is why you play TF so often! :D

2014-12-10 03:52:25	Beamboom	But that age thing is really quite interesting. When one have no relation to who they interact with, the image they get of them can differ quite substantially from the reality
2014-12-10 03:52:52	Beamboom	I had quite a few surprises during my mmorpg years,in that respect.

2014-12-10 05:57:44	Sik	> just noticed the topic changed
2014-12-10 06:02:07	RavenholmDX	lol neffo_
2014-12-10 06:02:28	RavenholmDX	I meant unfortunately, in the sense that I can't help him
2014-12-10 06:02:43	liamdawe	wow not often i get into an early access indie game
2014-12-10 06:03:19	RavenholmDX	Does Shovel Knight work with gamepads out of the box?
2014-12-10 06:03:23	Raven67854	Yes
2014-12-10 06:03:29	RavenholmDX	so I can just plug in a DS4?
2014-12-10 06:03:39	Raven67854	I suppose
2014-12-10 06:03:46	RavenholmDX	what about button prompts?
2014-12-10 06:03:53	Raven67854	Buttom prompts?
2014-12-10 06:04:01	RavenholmDX	like button icons on the screen or whatever
2014-12-10 06:04:09	gkeen	if you want to play games, your best bet is an xbox controller since all the bindings/button popups are for those controlleras
2014-12-10 06:04:12	gkeen	-a
2014-12-10 06:04:22	RavenholmDX	gkeen, that's been changing a bit lately
2014-12-10 06:04:28	RavenholmDX	was playing Far Cry 4 recently
2014-12-10 06:04:29	Raven67854	Yeah on windows
2014-12-10 06:04:37	Raven67854	FC4 on PS4?
2014-12-10 06:04:48	RavenholmDX	on PC, and it had DS4 button prompts
2014-12-10 06:04:55	Raven67854	It exists on PS4
2014-12-10 06:05:05	Raven67854	So it had to have that
2014-12-10 06:05:07	RavenholmDX	that was never really a case in the past though
2014-12-10 06:05:23	RavenholmDX	it also supported DS4 without having to use any DS4Tool or drivers
2014-12-10 06:05:26	neffo_	what do you mean ds4 prompts?
2014-12-10 06:05:35	RavenholmDX	the playstation buttons
2014-12-10 06:05:37	RavenholmDX	in the UI
2014-12-10 06:05:41	neffo_	ahh
2014-12-10 06:05:42	Raven67854	neffo_, shows playstation buttons in UI
2014-12-10 06:05:47	Raven67854	shovel knights probably doesn't do that
2014-12-10 06:05:59	neffo_	seriously guys why the similar names?
2014-12-10 06:06:03	neffo_	its confusing as hell
2014-12-10 06:06:10	 *	RavenholmDX isn't changing
2014-12-10 06:06:11	Raven67854	Well I was here first
2014-12-10 06:06:34	Raven67854	Not changing either. I guess turn on color names and pickup an english book :P
2014-12-10 06:06:35	gkeen	RavenholmDX: not that ive seen.. anyho.. the xbox one controller i got works great :)
2014-12-10 06:06:46	RavenholmDX	gkeen, I also have one of those
2014-12-10 06:06:48	neffo_	raven<tab> causes problems
2014-12-10 06:06:57	Raven67854	I know just like my joke
2014-12-10 06:07:07	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, Even without prompts game still should play fine
2014-12-10 06:07:17	gkeen	neffo_: not to mention they are the same color :/
2014-12-10 06:07:28	neffo_	white?
2014-12-10 06:07:32	neffo_	i am using irssi
2014-12-10 06:07:33	gkeen	no, pink
2014-12-10 06:07:35	gkeen	:P
2014-12-10 06:07:38	neffo_	ahh
2014-12-10 06:07:40	neffo_	xchat
2014-12-10 06:07:42	gkeen	ur red neffo_ :P
2014-12-10 06:07:45	RavenholmDX	I use irssi too
2014-12-10 06:07:50	gkeen	i use irccloud
2014-12-10 06:07:51	RavenholmDX	(although hexchat on Windows)
2014-12-10 06:08:08	Raven67854	Switch to hexchat and turn on colored names! :P
2014-12-10 06:08:10	RavenholmDX	irssi + screen + weed theme
2014-12-10 06:08:49	neffo_	can't you rename yourself grigori RavenholmDX ?
2014-12-10 06:09:04	Raven67854	That'd be to obvious then!
2014-12-10 06:09:08	neffo_	irssi just assumes i want to talk to Raven67854
2014-12-10 06:09:21	RavenholmDX	Sure, why would you want to talk to me?
2014-12-10 06:09:34	neffo_	haha
2014-12-10 06:10:00	neffo_	i value you both equally
2014-12-10 06:10:09	neffo_	its just your names are not judged by irssi that way
2014-12-10 06:10:20	Raven67854	You can't hit tab again?
2014-12-10 06:10:20	RavenholmDX	In hexchat, my name comes first when you tab
2014-12-10 06:10:28	neffo_	one of you is always going to be alphanumerically first
2014-12-10 06:10:53	RavenholmDX	Why not just type ravenh if you want to ping me
2014-12-10 06:11:00	RavenholmDX	or raven if you want to ping Raven67854
2014-12-10 06:11:08	Raven67854	Silence!
2014-12-10 06:11:21	neffo_	i never type more than 3 characters for a name if i can avoid it
2014-12-10 06:11:30	neffo_	why not rename yourself holm of ravens
2014-12-10 06:11:34	neffo_	that works
2014-12-10 06:11:54	--	RavenholmDX is now known as Raven67855
2014-12-10 06:11:55	neffo_	and Raven67854 can be 67854th raven
2014-12-10 06:12:07	neffo_	everyone is happy
2014-12-10 06:12:15	Raven67855	How do you like them apples
2014-12-10 06:12:22	neffo_	(i am ofcourse only joking)
2014-12-10 06:12:24	 *	Raven67854 high fives Raven67855 
2014-12-10 06:12:41	 *	Morgawr is confused
2014-12-10 06:12:50	--	Raven67855 is now known as RavenholmDX
2014-12-10 06:12:57	RavenholmDX	there you go Morgawr
2014-12-10 06:12:58	neffo_	i'm going to hack irssi
2014-12-10 06:13:16	Morgawr	:D
2014-12-10 06:13:27	neffo_	and rewrite it so that everyones nick is a salted hash generated from their nick
2014-12-10 06:13:35	RavenholmDX	lol
2014-12-10 06:13:41	neffo_	and you will all be equal
2014-12-10 06:13:43	Raven67854	Yeah that won't get confusing
2014-12-10 06:14:24	neffo_	chances are the first 3 characters will be unique though
2014-12-10 06:14:39	neffo_	whats the odds of a collision in the first 3 characters?
2014-12-10 06:14:57	neffo_	36^3 or there abouts
2014-12-10 06:15:01	RavenholmDX	you'll never know who anyone is referring though
2014-12-10 06:15:05	RavenholmDX	referring to*
2014-12-10 06:15:17	RavenholmDX	unless you get it to replace any instances of the name with the hash
2014-12-10 06:15:32	neffo_	that wouldn't be too hard
2014-12-10 06:15:42	RavenholmDX	how about when you're trying to ping someone
2014-12-10 06:15:53	RavenholmDX	you'd have to translate the hash back into the actual name
2014-12-10 06:16:01	RavenholmDX	which could be done with a key pair value or something
2014-12-10 06:16:06	RavenholmDX	but still annoying
2014-12-10 06:16:15	neffo_	trivial, i would think
2014-12-10 06:16:28	RavenholmDX	likely, just annoying
2014-12-10 06:16:32	neffo_	unless someone has a nick that is something like "that"
2014-12-10 06:16:35	neffo_	or "the"
2014-12-10 06:16:51	--	RavenholmDX is now known as TheRavenholmDX

2014-12-10 06:18:31	chesneyhawkes	have you seen moon?
2014-12-10 06:18:35	RavenholmDX	Yeah
2014-12-10 06:18:37	RavenholmDX	of course
2014-12-10 06:18:51	RavenholmDX	Was that song in it? can't remember
2014-12-10 06:18:58	chesneyhawkes	ok then you are my favourite of the ravens in the channel
2014-12-10 06:19:03	chesneyhawkes	the raven*

2014-12-10 06:19:36	RavenholmDX	I'm not a WoW player
2014-12-10 06:19:44	RavenholmDX	but I'm looking forward to the movie
2014-12-10 06:19:47	RavenholmDX	just because of Duncan Jones
2014-12-10 06:20:16	tadzik	huh, I only now made the connection, "wasn't this guy from #jollamobile?"
2014-12-10 06:20:34	RavenholmDX	#jollamobile is just a bunch of 1080p naysayers
2014-12-10 06:20:38	tadzik	hah
2014-12-10 06:20:54	tadzik	from a certain distance, every screen is retina! :P
2014-12-10 06:21:18	RavenholmDX	Yeah, I don't have 8ft arms thank you very much :P
2014-12-10 06:21:24	tadzik	:P
2014-12-10 06:22:00	RavenholmDX	They just don't understand the fact that a new mobile device in 2015, should at least try and conform to 2015-level mid range specs
2014-12-10 06:22:05	RavenholmDX	and that's going to be 1080p
2014-12-10 06:22:21	RavenholmDX	it's all personal preference really

2014-12-10 07:22:37	Beamboom	I've had a couple of half-hearted attempts of getting something to run on Wine with no success, so I've just given up on that
2014-12-10 07:22:58	Raven67854	The new dragons age won't work on wine anyway
2014-12-10 07:27:00	Beamboom	Raven67854, nope not tried spiral knights or Eldevin... Not even heard of them. Are they good, you'd say?
2014-12-10 07:27:15	Raven67854	Well they're native linux mmo's
2014-12-10 07:27:23	Beamboom	That's a start
2014-12-10 07:31:00	Beamboom	Eldevin is on Steam even! Wonder why I wasn't aware of it then...!
2014-12-10 07:31:36	Beamboom	hmmm - but marked win/mac only?
2014-12-10 07:32:50	Beamboom	Why do you lure me into despair?
2014-12-10 07:33:16	Raven67854	Beamboom, Can get it from their website
2014-12-10 07:33:23	Raven67854	But mac was only recently added so I assume Linux is next
2014-12-10 07:33:28	Raven67854	Same thing with Spiral Knights
2014-12-10 07:33:44	Beamboom	oh indeed. How strange

2014-12-10 07:35:39	Raven67854	Spiral Knights is the better looking game that's for sure haha
2014-12-10 07:35:42	Raven67854	Both are custom engines
2014-12-10 07:37:20	Raven67854	But both have consistent art styles so they look great.
2014-12-10 07:38:05	Beamboom	I look forward to look into this

2014-12-10 07:49:06	Raven67854	which game?
2014-12-10 07:49:20	Beamboom	Eldevin
2014-12-10 07:49:30	Raven67854	yeah you gotta get gear
2014-12-10 07:49:34	Beamboom	I'd not instantly guess this was a Java game
2014-12-10 07:50:16	Beamboom	so they are both using inhouse, custom engines then? Bummer.
2014-12-10 07:50:23	Raven67854	of course
2014-12-10 07:50:37	Beamboom	Didn't have to be like that
2014-12-10 07:50:45	Raven67854	Sure it did
2014-12-10 07:50:52	@Samsai	liamdawe, what was your favourite linux game of 2014? - no
2014-12-10 07:51:19	Raven67854	Beamboom, Doesn't matter anyway because it's very specific to the game anyway. If you want a FOSS java engine go use JMonkey.
2014-12-10 07:51:19	Beamboom	Not if there was a Unreal engine of the Java world, or CryEngine
2014-12-10 07:51:34	Raven67854	Uses BSD license quite nice as well
2014-12-10 07:51:40	liamdawe	Samsai: exactly, it's not an absolute
2014-12-10 07:51:40	Beamboom	I'm just not convinced jMonkey are able to produce good enough visuals!
2014-12-10 07:51:48	Raven67854	Beamboom, Why?
2014-12-10 07:51:57	Raven67854	More powerful of an engine than the one spiral knights or Eldevin uses
2014-12-10 07:52:01	Beamboom	I've just not seen anything impressive from it
2014-12-10 07:52:09	Raven67854	So go make something impressive with it
2014-12-10 07:52:16	Sik	Oh please, just learn how to cheat to work around limitations then
2014-12-10 07:52:25	Sik	:P
2014-12-10 07:52:50	Beamboom	haha that's what everyone says. But I want to see what I can expect from it - not explore if I am able to do something with it that's not done before.
2014-12-10 07:52:54	Sik	(bonus as that usually means being able to use weaker systems)
2014-12-10 07:53:11	Raven67854	Beamboom, can do anything you want
2014-12-10 07:53:18	Raven67854	JMonkey 3.1 is brining PBR rendering
2014-12-10 07:53:25	Beamboom	And that's what I want to get confirmed.
2014-12-10 07:53:39	liamdawe	Samsai: i think the guy is a bit of a dick
2014-12-10 07:53:40	Raven67854	I just said you can make anything you want with it
2014-12-10 07:53:52	Beamboom	And I just said I want to *see* it.
2014-12-10 07:53:52	@Samsai	liamdawe, yeah, maybe
2014-12-10 07:54:07	Raven67854	Beamboom, but nobody has made a AAA title with it yet
2014-12-10 07:54:17	Beamboom	It didn't have to be a full AAA game
2014-12-10 07:54:34	Beamboom	But some snippet of a scenery, like those Unreal demos, would be nice
2014-12-10 07:54:41	Raven67854	Not an artist
2014-12-10 07:55:40	Beamboom	Just to see that it can be done. I'm no super high level java programmer, I don't have the self esteem to think I can do what noone has done before me
2014-12-10 07:55:52	Raven67854	it can
2014-12-10 07:56:27	Beamboom	Unless I get proof I consider that an unconfirmed claim.
2014-12-10 07:57:02	Raven67854	As a game programmer I find that sentence silly
2014-12-10 07:57:42	Beamboom	It probably is. But that's noobs for you. We need to see it *can* be done, before we decide on the tools we choose
2014-12-10 07:58:04	Raven67854	Sucks to be you :)
2014-12-10 07:58:15	Raven67854	On Linux you have other choices besides JMonkey though
2014-12-10 07:58:17	tadzik	nice, a cities:skylines person replied to me about dlcs
2014-12-10 07:58:23	Beamboom	Had I had an indepth insight in how things work and would be able to consider based on mere facts on a sheet, then I'd not even start this conversation.
2014-12-10 07:58:43	Raven67854	Beamboom, Or you could just realize it's not just about the engine but also about the art you plug into it
2014-12-10 07:58:47	Raven67854	Take Eldevin for example
2014-12-10 07:58:49	Raven67854	It's a GL1 game
2014-12-10 07:58:55	Raven67854	Looks good because it has consistent art
2014-12-10 07:59:29	Raven67854	You could very easily make an ugly UE4 or Unity game
2014-12-10 07:59:33	Beamboom	True. But it's not all.
2014-12-10 07:59:33	Raven67854	All you need is bad art ^_^
2014-12-10 07:59:46	Beamboom	that's obvious
2014-12-10 07:59:51	turol	the problem with java is not that you can't make cool stuff
2014-12-10 08:00:06	turol	it's that after you get sufficiently complex the GC starts fucking you in the ass
2014-12-10 08:00:08	Beamboom	but like for example Unreal versus Cryengine: I dare say I can *clearly* see the difference from those two engines.
2014-12-10 08:00:15	turol	the microstutter can get really bad
2014-12-10 08:00:16	Beamboom	Clearly.
2014-12-10 08:00:30	Raven67854	Beamboom, Well they use different lighting models for starters
2014-12-10 08:00:39	Beamboom	Now, I bet they both have very similar specs, they can both do this and that and support this and that.*
2014-12-10 08:00:50	Raven67854	So yes they would look different visually
2014-12-10 08:01:06	Beamboom	Still, it's a huge difference. Or, Unity. A Unity game screams "UNITY" at you when you fire up the gam,e
2014-12-10 08:01:21	Raven67854	I think you're worry about silly things though
2014-12-10 08:01:23	Raven67854	I mean if you want to make games
2014-12-10 08:01:27	Raven67854	First step is learning to make games
2014-12-10 08:01:32	Raven67854	Not picking some stellar engine
2014-12-10 08:01:53	Beamboom	I agree. But at the same time, I wanna learn a framework I can grow in
2014-12-10 08:01:58	Raven67854	Jmonkey
2014-12-10 08:02:00	Raven67854	It's FOSS
2014-12-10 08:02:02	--	elysium is now known as elysium^away
2014-12-10 08:02:05	Raven67854	Can modify it for anything
2014-12-10 08:02:13	Raven67854	JMonkey also supports massive worlds out of the box for some damn reason
2014-12-10 08:02:34	Beamboom	Like, if you are a photographer, you wanna go for Photoshop even though you *could* at first do your stuff in <unsert whatever amateur tool>
2014-12-10 08:02:35	DerRidda	Godot is also a thing.
2014-12-10 08:02:43	Raven67854	There's also Esenthel, C4 Engine, Unreal Engine 4, Leadwerks, Gameplay(stupid name), Godot
2014-12-10 08:03:08	Raven67854	Ogre1 and Ogre2(if you're feeling lucky), Irrlicht

2014-12-10 08:05:10	Beamboom	But you see my point Raven67854? When all those highly professional engines are producing noteably different results, I really would love to see what jMonkey can do, when in the hands of pros
2014-12-10 08:05:55	Beamboom	I don't think that's silly
2014-12-10 08:06:56	<--	erkin (~e@unaffiliated/erkin) has quit (Client Quit)
2014-12-10 08:07:11	Raven67854	I dunno they don't use JMonkey. The reason UE4 and CryEngine look so different is because of the different lighting models
2014-12-10 08:08:05	Beamboom	I'm sure there's a reason for the differences between all engines.
2014-12-10 08:08:20	Raven67854	yes in the case of UE4 and Cryengine it's the lighting models :p
2014-12-10 08:08:36	Raven67854	They probably also do SSAO and various other postfx differently
2014-12-10 08:08:51	Beamboom	Would be real sweet to see how jMonkey would compare too. :)
2014-12-10 08:08:57	Beamboom	We're really going in circles here now :D
2014-12-10 08:09:00	Raven67854	Well find an artist willing to do that with you
2014-12-10 08:09:08	Raven67854	That's the main thing
2014-12-10 08:09:21	Raven67854	JMonkey is using UE4's way of doing PBR
2014-12-10 08:09:21	Beamboom	Yeah yeah, "why don't you do it yourself".
2014-12-10 08:09:32	Raven67854	Well nobody else is Beamboom
2014-12-10 08:09:49	Beamboom	... And that's the problem. From an engine promotional perspective
2014-12-10 08:09:57	Raven67854	So why not do it for them?
2014-12-10 08:10:10	Beamboom	When nobody's using it - could it then produce as good results?
2014-12-10 08:10:21	Raven67854	Er lots of people use JMonkey
2014-12-10 08:10:44	Beamboom	But none of them seem to have been able to produce anything like those other engines
2014-12-10 08:10:52	Raven67854	Well they haven't wanted to
2014-12-10 08:10:56	Beamboom	can't you see? That's the problem here!
2014-12-10 08:10:57	Raven67854	and it's expensive to get art like that
2014-12-10 08:10:59	DerRidda	This discussion again?
2014-12-10 08:11:04	Raven67854	ART IS EXPENSIVE Beamboom
2014-12-10 08:11:12	Raven67854	Unless you yourself happen to be an artist
2014-12-10 08:11:12	tadzik	heh, so it's lightning that makes the game look like a Source game, Unreal game or Unity game
2014-12-10 08:11:21	Raven67854	Indie's typically do not have the budget :P
2014-12-10 08:11:41	tadzik	we should have a contest where you have to guess the engine looking at the demo of something
2014-12-10 08:11:43	Raven67854	That's why they always go for the crappier pixel art style. Cheaper to produce
2014-12-10 08:11:49	Raven67854	tadzik, I'd win :P
2014-12-10 08:11:55	Beamboom	that would be interesting, tadzik!
2014-12-10 08:12:10	Raven67854	Thankfully Linux isn't that devoid of engines that are of quality anymore
2014-12-10 08:12:31	Raven67854	C4, Leadwerks, JMonkey, Esenthel, Godot all have fully features and working editors
2014-12-10 08:13:24	Beamboom	But yeah, they need big budgets and blablabla - it really doesn't differ anything in relation to my wish of seeing what it *can* do. Sucks to be jMonkey, sucks to be me, sucks to be anyone.
2014-12-10 08:13:34	Raven67854	Doesn't suck to be me
2014-12-10 08:13:36	Raven67854	or tadzik
2014-12-10 08:13:48	Beamboom	no of course - youre a professional with experience. :)
2014-12-10 08:14:13	Raven67854	I've never made a game of quality.. And the one game I have made that is of quality.. Is still TBA and is Windows Store =/
2014-12-10 08:14:18	tadzik	sucks, what sucks
2014-12-10 08:14:18	Beamboom	But to tell anyone who's not to just "go do it yourself" is really quite elitish and ignorant, if I may say so

2014-12-10 08:33:06	liamdawe	i'm not replying to an idiot like that any more
2014-12-10 08:33:36	liamdawe	someone who is insiting on complaining about a question mark in a title based on a law that the author even breaks...rather than the article content
2014-12-10 08:36:03	@Samsai	does gravity exist?
2014-12-10 08:36:07	@Samsai	of course not
2014-12-10 08:36:11	sobkas	there should be no question mark but a bang(!)
2014-12-10 08:36:24	liamdawe	Samsai: hahah
2014-12-10 08:36:34	liamdawe	Samsai: that's a perfect one

2014-12-10 08:37:29	liamdawe	that is gold
2014-12-10 08:38:16	liamdawe	also, i need to tear myself away from reassembly
2014-12-10 08:41:06	@Samsai	i should finish legend of grimrock and half-life 2 some day
2014-12-10 08:41:41	Morgawr	you never finished half-life 2?
2014-12-10 08:41:47	@Samsai	nope
2014-12-10 08:42:09	@Samsai	i've only played it under linux, and being a linux gamer these days seems quite hectic
2014-12-10 08:42:54	Morgawr	what :V
2014-12-10 08:43:22	@Samsai	it's not that i don't like half-life 2, but there have been so many games that i haven't had the time to complete it
2014-12-10 08:43:27	Morgawr	ah
2014-12-10 08:43:29	Morgawr	fair enough
2014-12-10 08:43:31	stuartm	I never finished Doom 3, become bored with it near the end after it moved to Hell (or whatever that place was), actually, for a similar reason to why a lot of people never finished the original Half-Life (Zen)
2014-12-10 08:43:43	Morgawr	yeah never finished doom 3 either because meh
2014-12-10 08:43:56	@Samsai	i should play doom 3 some day as well... thanks for reminding me
2014-12-10 08:43:59	Raven67854	I've beaten Doom 3 so many times it's insane
2014-12-10 08:44:06	Morgawr	finished doom 1 and doom 2 plenty of times when I was a kid though :D good times
2014-12-10 08:44:23	Morgawr	I wish I was a kid again, all that time to play videogames
2014-12-10 08:44:27	Raven67854	I should grab the doom 3 linux engine and get the content
2014-12-10 08:44:43	stuartm	played Doom 1 and 2 endlessly, although back then there weren't as many games to get excited about
2014-12-10 08:44:44	@Samsai	Raven67854, dhewm3 is nice
2014-12-10 08:44:51	Raven67854	Samsai, Yeah
2014-12-10 08:44:56	Raven67854	Also Doom 3 is oddly fun in coop
2014-12-10 08:45:06	@Samsai	it has co-op as well?
2014-12-10 08:45:10	Raven67854	mod
2014-12-10 08:45:13	@Samsai	oh
2014-12-10 08:46:51	tadzik	Raven67854: no, it just sucks
2014-12-10 08:46:54	Morgawr	one guy holds the torch
2014-12-10 08:46:57	Morgawr	the other holds the gun :P
2014-12-10 08:47:03	Raven67854	Morgawr, Nope
2014-12-10 08:47:04	tadzik	sometimes it's 15 KB/s, sometimes 100, sometimes it breaks up
2014-12-10 08:47:06	Raven67854	Well yeah
2014-12-10 08:47:21	tadzik	liamdawe: you care too much about random people
2014-12-10 08:47:29	Raven67854	Morgawr, Or you just run around with shotgun and not care :D
2014-12-10 08:47:36	tadzik	it's not worth to have the last word when someone is annoying
2014-12-10 08:47:46	tadzik	because you won't have the last word with such person anyway
2014-12-10 08:47:58	liamdawe	that's why im not replying to them :P
2014-12-10 08:48:08	Morgawr	(after 5 replies)

2014-12-10 09:06:45	RavenholmDX	liamdawe: what do you use for streaming?
2014-12-10 09:07:03	liamdawe	obs studio bud
2014-12-10 09:07:12	liamdawe	https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio
2014-12-10 09:07:13	GolliumBot	[ jp9000/obs-studio · GitHub ] - github.com
2014-12-10 09:08:00	@Samsai	liamdawe, made some slight changes, should be good now
2014-12-10 09:08:25	Morgawr	I have so many issues with obs
2014-12-10 09:08:31	Morgawr	I hope they fix them
2014-12-10 09:08:41	liamdawe	Samsai: ta
2014-12-10 09:08:43	Morgawr	sometimes when I drag windows around the application simply closes
2014-12-10 09:09:01	Morgawr	and when it does it the first time, then if I reopen it, it keeps crashing all the time when I drag and I have to reboot
2014-12-10 09:09:03	@Samsai	it's prone to crashing
2014-12-10 09:09:05	@Samsai	you need to treat it with care
2014-12-10 09:09:06	Morgawr	yeah
2014-12-10 09:09:07	RavenholmDX	obs is on linux now?
2014-12-10 09:09:10	Morgawr	Raven67854: yep
2014-12-10 09:09:14	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, been for a while
2014-12-10 09:09:15	RavenholmDX	I thought the linux port wasn't available yet
2014-12-10 09:09:20	Morgawr	I heard they are re-working it to be more OS-agnostic
2014-12-10 09:09:30	RavenholmDX	is this an unstable release then?
2014-12-10 09:09:30	Morgawr	also, I can't put pictures into my scenes
2014-12-10 09:09:45	Morgawr	I worked around that problem by opening a picture viewer and hooking a window capture to it
2014-12-10 09:09:47	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, yup, it's alpha code
2014-12-10 09:09:57	RavenholmDX	but it works?
2014-12-10 09:09:59	Morgawr	yes
2014-12-10 09:10:00	@Samsai	mostly, yes
2014-12-10 09:10:03	Morgawr	it works mostly
2014-12-10 09:10:08	RavenholmDX	nice, it's on AUR too
2014-12-10 09:10:09	Morgawr	if you can get around the annoyances
2014-12-10 09:10:24	Morgawr	like you set up a scene and everything, then you crash and reopen it and the scene is gone
2014-12-10 09:10:33	Morgawr	always close the program after you create a scene
2014-12-10 09:10:33	RavenholmDX	ah
2014-12-10 09:10:37	Morgawr	then reopen it and start streaming
2014-12-10 09:10:42	RavenholmDX	I wish I could get my capture card working in Linux
2014-12-10 09:10:44	Morgawr	so if you crash you can resume the stream without having to re-make it
2014-12-10 09:10:54	RavenholmDX	apparently there's a way to use a VM to capture
2014-12-10 09:11:01	RavenholmDX	but I'm not that bothered :P
2014-12-10 09:11:09	liamdawe	Morgawr: unstable or "stable" build?
2014-12-10 09:11:20	Morgawr	liamdawe: from AUR obs-studio-git I think
2014-12-10 09:11:25	Morgawr	or something like that
2014-12-10 09:11:30	@Samsai	Morgawr, how often is it updated?
2014-12-10 09:11:44	Morgawr	can't say I've seen it updated (or noticed it was updated) in a while
2014-12-10 09:11:53	@Samsai	stuff like pulseaudio fixes were in the git for a while before they made it into the PPA
2014-12-10 09:12:06	Morgawr	never had problems with pulseaudio
2014-12-10 09:12:11	@Samsai	i just compile the code straight from git these days
2014-12-10 09:12:13	Morgawr	thankfully :P
2014-12-10 09:12:21	Morgawr	I should try that as well
2014-12-10 09:12:29	Morgawr	not sure if it's different from the AUR git package
2014-12-10 09:12:39	Morgawr	but yeah, I heard from a friend that they are re-working the whole application
2014-12-10 09:12:45	Morgawr	to support not just windows
2014-12-10 09:13:06	Morgawr	because there are too many differences between OBS on linux and on windows from what I hear, they are like two different programs
2014-12-10 09:13:13	frostwork	afaik obs devs also work on nvenc implementation
2014-12-10 09:13:28	@Samsai	the os-agnostic build is already ready for mac
2014-12-10 09:13:35	Morgawr	also, on Linux I have the issue where I hook into a window to stream an opengl context and in some games it starts flickering and it's unstreamable
2014-12-10 09:13:49	Morgawr	best example is final fantasy 9 in an emulator, all the menus flicker and are invisible
2014-12-10 09:13:53	Morgawr	or streaming ziggurat
2014-12-10 09:14:01	Morgawr	I have to fall back to streaming the whole desktop/screen
2014-12-10 09:14:04	Morgawr	which is annoying
2014-12-10 09:14:16	@Samsai	ziggurat was fine for me
2014-12-10 09:14:24	Morgawr	(especially if you have only one screen like me, I had to resort to reading twitch chat from my phone as a second screen)
2014-12-10 09:14:33	Morgawr	maybe it's intel drivers, idk
2014-12-10 09:14:34	Morgawr	\o/
2014-12-10 09:14:54	@Samsai	you have obs working on intel?
2014-12-10 09:14:58	@Samsai	wow, that's something
2014-12-10 09:14:58	Morgawr	yes
2014-12-10 09:15:00	Morgawr	:V
2014-12-10 09:15:18	Morgawr	http://twitch.tv/morgonlinux I occasionally stream here

2014-12-10 09:15:20	@Samsai	my hd 3000 just complains about missing opengl stuff
2014-12-10 09:15:33	Morgawr	I've got HD4000, it works well
2014-12-10 09:15:53	@Samsai	i guess hd 4000 drivers have a newer opengl spec

2014-12-10 12:00:20	tadzik	heh, the TF2 equivalent, Stranges, is basically the worst you can get out of the crate
2014-12-10 12:00:37	tadzik	depending on what kind of crate is that
2014-12-10 12:00:39	RavenholmDX	is it just me, or is The Talos Principle a bit of a brute to run?
2014-12-10 12:02:35	disharmonic	Had no issues with a Phenom 2/HD5850(OSS drivers)

2014-12-10 12:38:21	@Samsai	but it might be a good idea to wait until it's properly out so that the porters get their share
2014-12-10 12:38:32	gnarface	i got my copy as a gift
2014-12-10 12:38:36	gnarface	like a year ago
2014-12-10 12:38:41	gnarface	not on steam
2014-12-10 12:38:44	gnarface	still shrink wrapped
2014-12-10 12:38:53	disharmonic	It's unclear who gets the money from 3rd party sales afaik
2014-12-10 12:38:53	gnarface	but you can bet i'll register it on steam if that linux port ever shows up
2014-12-10 12:39:35	linux_gamer	@ samsai,ok thats best but some might save their money
2014-12-10 12:39:56	disharmonic	Divinity is also on sale on the Humble store atm. The port has been delayed to early 2015 though
2014-12-10 12:41:11	disharmonic	Samsai: Have you seen any info on how sales from Humble, Indiegala etc get counted?

2014-12-10 12:46:15	flesk_	Humble uses your user agent by default.
2014-12-10 12:46:56	flesk_	Had some issues with that because it turned out the Dolphin browser on my phone used a Mac user agent by default.
2014-12-10 12:47:14	flesk_	But you can manually change the platform you want the sale to register for.
2014-12-10 12:47:53	flesk_	Not sure if they use some other methods internally if you e.g. download for a particular platform.
2014-12-10 12:48:18	disharmonic	flesk_: I doubt Humble deals with how the money is distributed regarding Steam sales
2014-12-10 12:48:45	flesk_	disharmonic: Yeah, I wasn't talking about that.

2014-12-10 12:49:35	flesk_	But I'm pretty sure developers have some kind of dashboard on Humble too that they use for things like OS statistics.
2014-12-10 12:49:47	disharmonic	flesk_: Humble is a key reseller. Why wouldn't steam get a cut?
2014-12-10 12:50:22	flesk_	Ah, right. It's different for the store.
2014-12-10 12:51:33	flesk_	If I recall correctly keys sold through Humble widgets are activated free of charge though.
2014-12-10 12:52:02	disharmonic	Right i wasn't very clear. I meant 3rd party store sales. Probably should have said GMG, Gamersgate, etc instead as those stores don't do bundles
2014-12-10 12:52:31	flesk_	Wouldn't those stores have similar dashboards though?
2014-12-10 12:54:41	disharmonic	I've always assumed that they bought keys from Steam and then resold them. But that may not be the way it's actually handled
2014-12-10 12:54:52	flesk_	I have no idea.
2014-12-10 12:55:09	flesk_	It would be interesting to know though.
2014-12-10 12:55:22	flesk_	But it's probably all NDA stuff.

2014-12-10 13:05:10	stuartm	apparently Aspyr overlooked it because the Mac doesn't have a Ctrl key (or similar)
2014-12-10 13:05:14	jasonm	Is it officially going to be fixed or is this speculation?

2014-12-10 13:19:19	flesk_	Along with the full release for Playstation 4.
2014-12-10 13:19:35	Morgawr	flesk_: uh... I don't remember exactly how far but the repetitive tasks at the beginning of his half were super boring
2014-12-10 13:19:39	Morgawr	I didn't get much far from there tbh
2014-12-10 13:20:16	flesk_	Morgawr: It's actually by intention. You're supposed to sort of feel the tedium he does and want to break out of that routine.
2014-12-10 13:20:46	flesk_	You don't have to do them again once you realize what you're supposed to do though.
2014-12-10 13:20:47	Morgawr	if the intent of the game is to make me feel bored and drop it, I don't know what to say
2014-12-10 13:21:16	flesk_	No, but it probably depends on your mileage with adventure games.
2014-12-10 13:21:24	Morgawr	I'm a point and click fanatic :P
2014-12-10 13:21:41	flesk_	I didn't spend much time there, but I've played those games since the late 80s.
2014-12-10 13:22:11	stuartm	might wait for the second part to be released then, see what the reviews for the complete game are like and maybe benefit from a bundle
2014-12-10 13:23:04	Morgawr	stuartm: second part is included in the first game's purchase in case you didn't know

2014-12-10 13:23:44	stuartm	Morgawr: ah, well even more reason to wait and see then
2014-12-10 13:24:04	flesk_	stuartm: They've tried to avoid relying on nostalgia with that game.
2014-12-10 13:24:15	flesk_	I appreciate both kinds though.
2014-12-10 13:24:20	stuartm	The Cave was amusing but ultimately slightly disappointing
2014-12-10 13:24:45	flesk_	Like Thimbleweed Park appeals a lot to me and that game's main thing seems to be the nostalgia.
2014-12-10 13:24:54	stuartm	still, definitely going to be getting the Grim Fandango re-release

2014-12-10 13:26:44	flesk_	Grim Fandango I mean.
2014-12-10 13:27:04	flesk_	That signpost puzzle was extremely frustrating the first time I did it though.
2014-12-10 13:27:10	gnarface	man
2014-12-10 13:27:14	gnarface	i loved grim fandango

2014-12-10 13:27:31	gnarface	it finally works great in wine last i heard, so now i have no excuses
2014-12-10 13:27:44	stuartm	disharmonic: Atlantis? Loved that game at the time, although I remember periods of intense frustration when I got stuck
2014-12-10 13:28:14	stuartm	disharmonic: sorry, for some reason I though Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis when you said Tomb Raider
2014-12-10 13:28:19	stuartm	thought
2014-12-10 13:28:47	stuartm	guess because we were talking about classic point & click adventures
2014-12-10 13:28:50	Morgawr	atlantis was 10/10
2014-12-10 13:29:01	Morgawr	my favorite point and click of all time
2014-12-10 13:29:38	disharmonic	Heh, that was indeed a great game. Would be cool if that could get  an update like the Monkey Isand games

2014-12-10 13:32:28	disharmonic	gnarface: more likely a bug. But i relaunched it to be safe
2014-12-10 13:32:33	stuartm	disharmonic: yeah, I'd be careful - seems dodgy IMHO
2014-12-10 13:33:33	stuartm	hopefully a bug, but not entirely impossible that someone has found an XSS vulnerability
2014-12-10 13:34:11	gnarface	i was thinking DNS poisoning

2014-12-10 14:08:36	flesk_	It starts off simple for sure. It gets harder when you have to deal with real code later in the game though.

2014-12-10 18:41:29	Raven67854	Happy-Ferret, Unsure wayland/mir are a fair bit different
2014-12-10 18:41:40	Raven67854	Seems they both "sandbox" apps
2014-12-10 18:43:04	Happy-Ferret	Yea. You might be right about that.
2014-12-10 18:43:40	Raven67854	Indeed
2014-12-10 18:44:01	Raven67854	I don't know how xwayland/xmir will be handled
2014-12-10 18:44:23	Raven67854	I would assume they would be potentially vulnerable but not as easily as if you were running xorg.
2014-12-10 18:44:39	Raven67854	Hopefully the move to wayland/mir will be quick. We do move rather quickly in the Linux world
2014-12-10 18:44:50	Happy-Ferret	Personally, I consider concentrating on DirectFB for my little OS.
2014-12-10 18:44:58	Raven67854	Eugh

2014-12-10 18:45:44	Raven67854	I dunno I'd rather just use wayland :p
2014-12-10 18:45:58	Raven67854	Half-Shot showed me some neat code writing a window manager in Wayland
2014-12-10 18:46:00	Raven67854	Pretty simplistic
2014-12-10 18:46:34	Raven67854	But DirectFB could work I suppose depending on what you're doing
2014-12-10 18:46:39	Happy-Ferret	I'm not competing with GNU/Linux distros, so I might as well strip my OS of all the legacy GNU/Linux stuff and call it a day.
2014-12-10 18:46:47	Raven67854	waylands not legacy

2014-12-11 03:29:56	Nothing_Much	booooooo dwdf
2014-12-11 03:32:12	stuartm	wonder what their strategy is with gifting a copy of a game that's unfinished? If they can afford to give it away, why even bother trying to sell it with all the bad press that's creating?
2014-12-11 03:34:04	tadzik	it is finished according to double fine
2014-12-11 03:34:06	tadzik	1.0 and all that
2014-12-11 03:34:42	stuartm	I like Double Fine, I don't hold the fact that they made a mistake with SP DF9 against them, every company makes mistakes and people buying games in Early Access should have known the risk they were running, but I do question their strategy of continuing to sell it
2014-12-11 03:37:10	tadzik	I don't see why they would give their work away for free, finished or not
2014-12-11 03:38:02	stuartm	yeah, it makes no sense to me
2014-12-11 03:38:26	tadzik	wait what
2014-12-11 03:38:42	tadzik	you question their strategy of continuing to sell it, but now you say it makes no sense to give it away
2014-12-11 03:39:15	stuartm	tadzik: they ARE giving it away free if you buy one of their other games
2014-12-11 03:39:28	tadzik	I think their idea of giving copies away to HnS buyers is their "We're sorry, have a cookie"
2014-12-11 03:39:31	stuartm	I'm saying they should just withdraw it entirely
2014-12-11 03:39:40	tadzik	they still sell it as a regular game
2014-12-11 03:39:45	tadzik	I don't see anything wrong with that
2014-12-11 03:40:30	stuartm	tadzik: it's bad for business, have you seen the forums for the game? Just endless complaints, calls for boycotts of Double Fine, suggestions of class action lawsuits etc
2014-12-11 03:40:31	tadzik	I wonder if anyone bothered to make a clear-headed, non-emotional review of DF9
2014-12-11 03:40:34	tadzik	I was quite interested in that game
2014-12-11 03:40:54	tadzik	stuartm: and pulling that game from the store is going to fix that how, exactly?
2014-12-11 03:41:39	Cheeseness	tadzik: I own it and have played it. I haven't written about the game, but I don't mind discussing it
2014-12-11 03:41:45	tadzik	the emotional reaction is a vocal minority of people who clearly have little understanding of what Early Access is about
2014-12-11 03:41:55	stuartm	some people are saying they built their base of 6 buildings, what happens next? Apparently the game ends with a big fleet coming along and destroying the base ... which a lot of people are understandably disappointed with
2014-12-11 03:42:05	tadzik	there is no point in trying to please them by meeting their silly demands
2014-12-11 03:42:38	tadzik	Cheeseness: is it fun to play, as a tycoon? How many hours of playing can I expect before I get bored?
2014-12-11 03:42:40	Cheeseness	stuartm: The idea is that you're meant to prevent your base from being destroyed (I agree that it's perhaps not the best endgame challenge)
2014-12-11 03:43:45	Cheeseness	tadzik: I enjoy playing it. It's definitely got some rough edges though. I've got about 30 hours in the game, and most of that was pre-release, and I don't feel like I'm done with it yet
2014-12-11 03:44:13	Cheeseness	I don't know what your tastes are like, so I can't say how long you'd be willing to play it :D
2014-12-11 03:44:36	stuartm	tadzik: as long as it's available more people are going to buy it and end up joining the ranks of the complainers, IMHO that's not the way to win future customers for their other games, it just destroys their reputation and for what? If they can afford to give the game away then they obviously don't need the income from it

2014-12-11 03:45:32	stuartm	I've not played it, so I'll reserve judgement on whether it value for money (not hard since it was free :) )
2014-12-11 03:45:35	tadzik	what Cheeseness says, I haven't seen an actually criticism of the game thus far
2014-12-11 03:45:46	tadzik	it's all "omg df you done fucked up burn"
2014-12-11 03:46:13	Cheeseness	It's a long way from amazing, but it's not terrible. It doesn't take long to dig up a "I didn't hear about this game before. It seems OK. I don't understand why everybody is angry" type user review from someone who wasn't involved in the pre-release mess
2014-12-11 03:47:06	stuartm	the one complaint I've seen is the lack of any progression, but if Cheeseness has 30 hours already then I'd say there is enough content
2014-12-11 03:47:38	Cheeseness	tadzik: People were already very disappointed by the amount of communication pre the 0.6 update, and the communication that accompanied that update seemed to imply that development would continue, so it was a surprise when the 1.0 announcement was made
2014-12-11 03:50:47	stuartm	I thought DF had conceded that not all goals for the game had been met? Or was it more than people's expectations didn't match what DF had planned?
2014-12-11 03:50:47	Cheeseness	stuartm: There's admittedly not a lot, but there's not a lot of "progression" in SimCity either (at least, the ones that I played). There are research tiers you can use to upgrade your builders, security forces and miners (I think?), which do give a little bit of a sense of progression though
2014-12-11 03:51:05	DrMcCoy	I am in so far disappointed in DF-9 in that it doesn't reach the depth of Dwarf Fortress. I had hopes that it would at first, but the further the development went, the more of that hope I lost
2014-12-11 03:51:16	tadzik	well, in simcity I played you had 150 years of game time before you got all the tech unlocks
2014-12-11 03:51:35	tadzik	I refuse to acknowledge the existence of any other simcity
2014-12-11 03:51:52	DrMcCoy	Right now, it's a middling sandbox game like hundreds of others
2014-12-11 03:51:53	Cheeseness	When they first launched on Steam Early Access, they shared a document which was presented as a wishlist that had a big long list of things they'd love to put in. It also stated pretty clearly that some of it wouldn't get in, and that with limited resources they'd have to make hard decisions
2014-12-11 03:52:09	Cheeseness	tadzik: I never played a SimCity game that had tech unlocks \o/
2014-12-11 03:52:29	DrMcCoy	And that kinda makes DF-9 mostly uninteresting for me now *shrug*
2014-12-11 03:52:31	tadzik	Cheeseness: really? :) 3000k is waiting for your attention then
2014-12-11 03:52:48	Cheeseness	I stopped being interested after 2000
2014-12-11 03:52:48	tadzik	sadly, the only realiable way to play it that I found was firing up virtualbox
2014-12-11 03:52:49	DrMcCoy	The only SimCity is SimCity 2000
2014-12-11 03:52:55	Cheeseness	I spent most of my time in the original SimCity though
2014-12-11 03:53:20	DrMcCoy	Cheeseness: Awesome 7DFPS article, btw :)
2014-12-11 03:53:27	stuartm	somewhere I've still got a copy of  SimCity 2000, the one game from the past I didn't throw out (only because it was hidden in a box of stuff which I only recently found)
2014-12-11 03:53:33	Cheeseness	DrMcCoy: Thanks. I'm glad you appreciated it :)
2014-12-11 03:53:59	tadzik	I fear that in my expectations there will never be another city building game after 3k, no matter what Skylines turns out to be
2014-12-11 03:54:10	DrMcCoy	Cheeseness: As much as I can appreciate an article throwing about a thousand interesting links I have to follow at me ;)
2014-12-11 03:54:11	Cheeseness	DrMcCoy: Oh, also. Were you interested in my text adventure. I can get you in on some early builds if you're super excited about the concept
2014-12-11 03:54:33	DrMcCoy	I am
2014-12-11 03:54:55	Cheeseness	Cool cool. What's the best way to shoot you stuff?
2014-12-11 03:55:29	DrMcCoy	drmccoy(at)drmccoy(dot)de, I guess
2014-12-11 03:55:43	Cheeseness	Alrighty
2014-12-11 03:55:54	Cheeseness	I'll jot that down and give you a nudge next time I'm sending stuff out
2014-12-11 03:56:00	DrMcCoy	Thanks :)
2014-12-11 03:57:01	Cheeseness	If I can pull it all together and make something interesting, I'd like to make the engine available so that people can do similar things

2014-12-11 03:58:23	Cheeseness	I'm still working out how to approach things. If it works as a solid experience, then I'd like to see whether I can make the game commercial or crowdfund its development or something

2014-12-11 03:59:41	DrMcCoy	Well, depending on how deep your script / engine rift is, I'd say go for AGPLv3 for the engine, but I am one of those freetards as jaycee likes to say

2014-12-11 04:02:37	Cheeseness	I'm still working out what would best suit the project
2014-12-11 04:02:56	Cheeseness	From the perspective of making it accessible to people who want to make games
2014-12-11 04:03:15	DrMcCoy	Sure, entirely your choice. For better and for worse ;)
2014-12-11 04:03:21	Leftmost	Which project is this? I'm too intoxicated to do backread.
2014-12-11 04:03:22	Cheeseness	^_^
2014-12-11 04:03:49	Cheeseness	Leftmost: I've been making a first person text adventure. I'm considering making the engine available

2014-12-11 05:42:44	RavenholmDX	Is it just me, or is it a pretty demanding game?
2014-12-11 05:42:46	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, guess that means you didn't do the puzzle that requires another puzzle :P
2014-12-11 05:43:01	Raven67854	It can be demanding. It does run on the Serious Sam 3 engine
2014-12-11 05:43:12	norbert	SS4 engine, if I'm not mistaken
2014-12-11 05:43:18	Raven67854	No
2014-12-11 05:43:26	Raven67854	Serious Engine 3.5 same as SS3 :P
2014-12-11 05:43:27	norbert	pretty sure is't the SS4 engine
2014-12-11 05:43:29	RavenholmDX	On Ultra, 8xAA, I was probably getting like 40FPS in the forest
2014-12-11 05:44:15	RavenholmDX	and yeah, it's on the SS4 engine
2014-12-11 05:44:19	RavenholmDX	according to Croteam
2014-12-11 05:44:30	Raven67854	But there's not serious sam 4 0_o

2014-12-11 05:49:15	Raven67854	Should be

2014-12-11 05:49:22	RavenholmDX	it's LED
2014-12-11 05:49:26	RavenholmDX	TN panel I believe

2014-12-11 05:50:20	Raven67854	but sold it to a friend
2014-12-11 05:50:25	Raven67854	and bought this over a recent sale
2014-12-11 05:50:34	Raven67854	I literally just got it
2014-12-11 05:50:40	RavenholmDX	I'm waiting until they get more affordable
2014-12-11 05:50:49	RavenholmDX	€3-400 euro
2014-12-11 05:50:50	Raven67854	I don't notice much of a difference between this and my other one honestly
2014-12-11 05:51:09	tadzik	I'd buy one for €3
2014-12-11 05:51:32	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, Thankfully though with that high of resolution not having AA on is barely noticeable
2014-12-11 05:51:50	RavenholmDX	I only have a GTX 970 though
2014-12-11 05:52:02	Raven67854	Plenty of power
2014-12-11 05:52:15	RavenholmDX	How does it compare to the Titan-Z?
2014-12-11 05:52:24	tadzik	if you can put out 240 fps at fullhd you should be fine on 4k, no?
2014-12-11 05:52:28	Raven67854	Marginally slower than 1 of the titan-z's GPU's with less vram
2014-12-11 05:52:48	RavenholmDX	tadzik, 240fps?
2014-12-11 05:52:56	tadzik	4*60
2014-12-11 05:52:58	RavenholmDX	sure
2014-12-11 05:53:06	Raven67854	tadzik, Not necessarily no.. It's not linear growth.
2014-12-11 05:53:11	RavenholmDX	I feel going 4K now
2014-12-11 05:53:18	RavenholmDX	demands more regular GPU upgrades though
2014-12-11 05:53:26	Raven67854	Yeah
2014-12-11 05:53:37	Raven67854	But coding on a 4k screen is just a beautiful experience
2014-12-11 05:53:44	RavenholmDX	that's why I'd like it
2014-12-11 05:53:54	RavenholmDX	RavenholmDX, do you turn the DPI up?
2014-12-11 05:54:02	Raven67854	Everythings at default
2014-12-11 05:54:08	RavenholmDX	text not too small?
2014-12-11 05:54:14	Raven67854	Well I use Ubuntu
2014-12-11 05:54:21	Raven67854	It seems to handle it okay
2014-12-11 05:54:33	Raven67854	I haven't hit any cases yet where it's sucked
2014-12-11 05:55:06	Raven67854	I wouldn't get a 20" 4k screen :p
2014-12-11 05:55:17	RavenholmDX	lol
2014-12-11 05:55:18	Raven67854	28" seems to be the sweet spot if you ask me
2014-12-11 05:55:39	RavenholmDX	I'm also considering a 21:9 screen

2014-12-11 06:59:41	mirv_	always wanted to visit there
2014-12-11 06:59:49	mirv_	I'll be able to next year, yay!
2014-12-11 07:00:49	RavenholmDX	Haha, it's a nice country
2014-12-11 07:00:56	RavenholmDX	Dublin is a cool city to visit
2014-12-11 07:01:02	RavenholmDX	and it's only 30 minutes from the UK
2014-12-11 07:01:59	mirv_	I consider it close if it's less than 1.5 hours by plane
2014-12-11 07:02:21	RavenholmDX	 I know people who live in Dublin
2014-12-11 07:02:25	RavenholmDX	but work in London
2014-12-11 07:02:35	RavenholmDX	fly there every morning
2014-12-11 07:02:40	RavenholmDX	fly back in the evening
2014-12-11 07:02:42	mirv_	damn, they're keen
2014-12-11 07:03:10	RavenholmDX	they're getting the right money :P
2014-12-11 07:03:35	RavenholmDX	They're getting an inner city London salary, and get to live in a relatively cheaper part of Dublin
2014-12-11 07:03:35	mirv_	yeah, (good) jobs in London pay quite well
2014-12-11 07:03:40	tadzik	I'm surprised they're willing to put up with the annoyance that air travel is
2014-12-11 07:04:53	DrMcCoy	they should ask their employer for a private helicopter ;)
2014-12-11 07:06:42	RavenholmDX	I think they have it set up in a way that they don't have to go through security
2014-12-11 07:06:52	RavenholmDX	basically some form of pre-clearance
2014-12-11 07:07:01	RavenholmDX	so that cuts the majority of the time off the flight
2014-12-11 07:07:19	tadzik	wow, awesome
2014-12-11 07:07:29	RavenholmDX	I think it's about 90minutes each way for them
2014-12-11 07:07:32	tadzik	it's like living in a normal world
2014-12-11 07:07:53	RavenholmDX	Dublin Airport security is great though
2014-12-11 07:07:56	RavenholmDX	best I've seen in the world
2014-12-11 07:08:09	RavenholmDX	I can get in the airport doors, and be on the other side of security within 10 minutes

2014-12-11 10:12:02	warPenguin	I still have the borderlands presequel barely untouched and had to stop playing bl2 after beating it once because the games kept piling up... even tho I was enjoying the multiplayer part
2014-12-11 10:12:05	warPenguin	u.u
2014-12-11 10:12:31	warPenguin	the witcher 2 untouched as well

2014-12-11 10:12:51	@Samsai	i'll add that to my "gotta play someday" list
2014-12-11 10:12:55	tadzik	heh, witcher 2 is easily 24 hours of gameplay
2014-12-11 10:13:02	warPenguin	tadzik: yeah... I had my fair share of hours in tf2 too... I bought the game when it came out
2014-12-11 10:13:08	tadzik	for one branch of the campaign, that is
2014-12-11 10:13:55	warPenguin	yeah... I dont want to really look up at empire or those strat games... they seem like they could sunk a lot of hours
2014-12-11 10:14:45	warPenguin	battle block theater was amazing, btw... I would love to play castle crushers as well
2014-12-11 10:15:38	tadzik	heh, I started playing tf2 last december, clocked about 700 hours so far
2014-12-11 10:16:02	frostwork	yeah bbt was great, warPenguin
2014-12-11 10:16:02	tadzik	just formed a 6s team, so it's only gonna get worse :P
2014-12-11 10:16:20	warPenguin	ahahah tadzik
2014-12-11 10:16:35	warPenguin	seriously, my productivity is going down the toilet
2014-12-11 10:16:45	mirv_	be interested in how well Metro works, seeing as it's GL4
2014-12-11 10:16:49	@Samsai	no productivity, only games now
2014-12-11 10:16:57	warPenguin	I wanted to start doing some work in debian on my free time... but I dont have freetime anymore
2014-12-11 10:17:01	tadzik	I practically don't do any opensource since steam on linux is out
2014-12-11 10:17:17	sigz	lol samsai, i'm sure you never complete any game ;)
2014-12-11 10:17:24	tadzik	hmm, I wasn't planning to get Metro LL Redux, since it probably isn't any better than the regular LL
2014-12-11 10:17:32	@Samsai	sigz, i have completed some games!
2014-12-11 10:17:44	tadzik	the bundle is barely any more expensive than the base game though..
2014-12-11 10:17:46	@Samsai	14 to be precise
2014-12-11 10:17:59	sigz	over how many
2014-12-11 10:18:06	@Samsai	... out of my 231
2014-12-11 10:18:09	sigz	:D
2014-12-11 10:18:15	Dezponia	Metro Retro working well?
2014-12-11 10:18:17	tadzik	also, I enjoy how it's on Linux but not on mac :P
2014-12-11 10:18:29	warPenguin	tadzik: i was thinking the same... but checkout the comments on the redux games... they are all very positive
2014-12-11 10:18:41	warPenguin	so ill have to buy them... and maybe play them... dunno
2014-12-11 10:18:48	@Samsai	i guess even LL uses gl4
2014-12-11 10:18:56	sigz	@tadzik i'm thinking like you for Metro LL, but seeing bundle price, why not...
2014-12-11 10:18:57	@Samsai	so it might look prettier than the original port
2014-12-11 10:19:03	tadzik	well, I played and enjoyed Metro LL, but I don't feel like playing it for the second time really
2014-12-11 10:19:05	frostwork	Dezponia, it is not yet downloadable
2014-12-11 10:19:11	tadzik	so I don't see much point in buying LL Redux

2014-12-11 10:46:46	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, i'll do a quick test run
2014-12-11 10:47:13	warPenguin	MisterBubbles: but wait until we check it out first... its not even downloadable yet :(
2014-12-11 10:47:45	warPenguin	btw, what was new on the new trine that came out last month?
2014-12-11 10:47:57	warPenguin	I had already played because it was already out, wasnt it?
2014-12-11 10:48:05	RavenholmDX	Samsai: I have it downloaded
2014-12-11 10:48:10	frostwork	yes as beta, warPenguin
2014-12-11 10:48:20	frostwork	today the official release
2014-12-11 10:48:22	MisterBubbles	warPenguin: Well the new Metro doesn't run on Intel cards.
2014-12-11 10:48:28	MisterBubbles	So it doesn't matter if its better :P
2014-12-11 10:50:01	warPenguin	MisterBubbles: The game is perfectly optimized so that low end pc's can easly run this on low with atleast 50fps witch is a BIG PLUS also.
2014-12-11 10:50:29	MisterBubbles	warPenguin: It is OpenGL 4 so only proprietary drivers work.
2014-12-11 10:50:36	warPenguin	from dravenzo positivew review of  metro 2033 redux
2014-12-11 10:51:18	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, well, i guess you can test it out by yourself
2014-12-11 10:51:35	@Samsai	but based on my short test run it seems to run very well
2014-12-11 10:51:57	liamdawe	the Scrolls devs (mojang) would rather link to a windows download, than the in-testing linux client on their site <_<
2014-12-11 10:52:44	qweqwe	Is metro going to work with open sauce drivers?
2014-12-11 10:52:57	MisterBubbles	qweqwe: apparently not.
2014-12-11 10:53:33	@Samsai	if it requires gl4, then nope
2014-12-11 10:53:59	@Samsai	libre drivers can only do 3.3 if i recall correctly
2014-12-11 10:54:13	qweqwe	I have the original version of Metro: Last Light and it keeps crashing with catalyst
2014-12-11 10:56:26	RavenholmDX	I need some more Linux people on Steam
2014-12-11 10:56:52	RavenholmDX	at least to provide better recommendations on the store :P

2014-12-11 11:59:02	@Samsai	Saleck, i guess nvidia drivers just broke

2014-12-11 11:59:18	liamdawe	Saleck: (laptop)
2014-12-11 11:59:31	Saleck	no

2014-12-11 11:59:47	Saleck	ok
2014-12-11 11:59:49	liamdawe	mine did that on mint and something just didn't install correctly
2014-12-11 12:00:12	Dezponia	My solution is to simply not keep windowws around at all
2014-12-11 12:00:23	@Samsai	yeah, windows breaks stuff
2014-12-11 12:00:27	@Samsai	let's just blame windows
2014-12-11 12:00:28	liamdawe	or have different machines for different os
2014-12-11 12:00:34	liamdawe	it's what i would do
2014-12-11 12:00:34	Dezponia	Yepp
2014-12-11 12:00:57	DrMcCoy	Dunno, in that case, it might actually just be the Mint update that broke things, not the booting into Windows
2014-12-11 12:01:31	@Samsai	DrMcCoy, can't be, mint has its stable updates, which are always 100% stable
2014-12-11 12:01:51	@Samsai	it's like debian, if it were more stable
2014-12-11 12:01:53	DrMcCoy	Hmm, okay. I admit, I know next to nothing about Mint
2014-12-11 12:02:04	@Samsai	and i'm being sarcastic
2014-12-11 12:02:34	liamdawe	hey i got that one :D
2014-12-11 12:02:43	@Samsai	in all honesty, windows probably had nothing to do with it
2014-12-11 12:02:51	@Samsai	but it's fun to blame it anyway
2014-12-11 12:02:59	Dezponia	Samsai: So you're saying it was ACTUALLY the NSA?
2014-12-11 12:03:05	liamdawe	#gamingonlinux where windows is blamed for everything

2014-12-11 12:03:25	Dezponia	Hes better now though
2014-12-11 12:03:30	@Samsai	Dezponia, my theory is that swedes broke the drivers

2014-12-11 12:04:41	Dezponia	mETz: Probably windows faullt
2014-12-11 12:04:48	mETz	nope
2014-12-11 12:04:49	@Samsai	or NSA
2014-12-11 12:04:54	@Samsai	probably NSA

2014-12-11 12:05:59	Saleck	will do :) I had to install the drivers manually which was something I'd never done before. I'm on a GTX 970 and Mint's driver manager doesn't grab functional drivers for me automatically

2014-12-11 12:09:59	liamdawe	it's looking soooo good, can't wait to put it live for you all <3
2014-12-11 12:10:21	liamdawe	I will run a beta of the new site first, to make sure we iron issues out
2014-12-11 12:10:48	flesk_	liamdawe: Do you have an ETA?
2014-12-11 12:12:39	liamdawe	flesk_: hard to say, waiting on a few minor button images from the designer, sales page needs some adjustments too, and I need to turn our carousel uploader into the new background image uploader
2014-12-11 12:12:56	liamdawe	tbh i've got the majority of it all done in 2 days ive had off from work
2014-12-11 12:13:03	liamdawe	so, not lng

2014-12-11 12:13:35	flesk_	Cool. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
2014-12-11 12:13:52	liamdawe	im tempted to put the beta up tonight
2014-12-11 12:14:10	flesk_	I've seen the teasers but it will be something else to experience it live I think.
2014-12-11 12:14:45	liamdawe	there's one up at the moment, but it's very broken, i've had to add in checks in literally every single link for pretty apache urls, or normal links so i can use it on my local machine
2014-12-11 12:14:52	liamdawe	thats taken a fair bit of time to do
2014-12-11 12:15:38	liamdawe	fuck it, i will try to put up a working beta for people tonight

2014-12-11 13:43:00	stqn	stuartm: Dead Island works "great" for me (nvidia gtx 660 + core i3 + arch linux), but you can’t repair weapons to 100% (and thus can’t improve them), and the things you find in corpses and crates are always the same.
2014-12-11 13:43:38	RavenholmDX	stqn: that seems like bugs in the actual game that can be patched I presume
2014-12-11 13:44:11	stqn	RavenholmDX: not sure what you mean.
2014-12-11 13:44:22	RavenholmDX	just googled, seems like it's an issue in the Windows version too

2014-12-11 13:53:17	RavenholmDX	what a stupid bug
2014-12-11 13:53:31	RavenholmDX	I have no idea how one could be related to the other :P
2014-12-11 13:53:32	stqn	it’s weird
2014-12-11 13:54:23	stqn	perhaps changing the video options causes the game to save/reload its state, which fixes things
2014-12-11 13:55:36	stqn	being stuck at 99% seems like a floating point bug to me
2014-12-11 13:55:37	gnarface	sounds like a bug from like quake2
2014-12-11 13:56:09	gnarface	does it happen on non-intel cpus?

2014-12-11 15:32:30	Yamagata	Morgawr, MisterBubbles i've got it and messed around with it quite a lot. it's really neat and development is proceeding at a super fast pace, but it's still pre-alpha
2014-12-11 15:33:15	Yamagata	they only have a small island available that's not on any world maps currently. it primarily has content to demo and test game mechanics and systems. even given that though i've dunked 36 hours into and and had a ton of fun
2014-12-11 15:33:53	Morgawr	Yamagata: interesting, thanks for sharing

2014-12-11 15:34:01	Morgawr	although that doesn't help me ;_; now I want to get it lol
2014-12-11 15:34:14	Yamagata	it will *definitely* be worth grabbing when they hit beta or get closer to the official release
2014-12-11 15:34:20	Morgawr	yus
2014-12-11 15:34:24	Morgawr	will keep an eye on it
2014-12-11 15:34:36	Yamagata	so if you don't think you'll enjoy some half-broken stuff and massive, sweeping changed and db resets deleting your character every month, avoid it for now
2014-12-11 15:34:48	Yamagata	*changes
2014-12-11 15:35:03	Morgawr	I don't mind that, I put up with a lot of bullshit from path of exile closed beta in the early days
2014-12-11 15:35:08	Morgawr	but I'll wait for it to be a bit more mature
2014-12-11 15:35:10	Morgawr	I guess
2014-12-11 15:35:18	Morgawr	unless it gets cheap enough this sale :P
2014-12-11 15:35:33	Yamagata	yeah, if it's cheap it's worth nabbing. even if for the future
2014-12-11 15:35:40	Morgawr	exactly
2014-12-11 15:35:55	Yamagata	they've had monthly releases like clockwork and it's kind of surprising how much of a really novel and interesting mmo they've mad in such a short time
2014-12-11 15:36:07	Yamagata	it feels a lot like the game everyone was hoping ESO would be, tbh
2014-12-11 15:38:03	Morgawr	aww come on don't say this, now I want to buy it
2014-12-11 15:38:12	Yamagata	haha
2014-12-11 15:38:37	Yamagata	i've enjoyed it, but i apparently spend too much on steam, got 306 games in my linux list alone
2014-12-11 15:38:46	Yamagata	$40 is kinda steep for a glorified mmo demo atm
2014-12-11 15:39:20	Yamagata	but the devs know that at least. they had it open to backers and such outside of steam, they just wanted to grow the potential audience. it warns you constantly it's UNDER CONSTRUCTION heh

2014-12-11 17:28:32	stqn	so no
2014-12-11 17:29:49	gnarface	Happy-Ferret: just get the tar.gz file from adobe directly and manually copy the libflashplayer.so file into your plugins directory over top the old one
2014-12-11 17:29:53	gnarface	you don't need the rest of it

2014-12-11 17:33:39	gnarface	Happy-Ferret: they have their reasons, but i even recommend that you remove the wheezy flash package manually first, and purge it completely, after first verifying where it put the libflashplayer.so file (so you know you've put it in the right directory; there are several valid ones but not all of them are treated equally)

2014-12-11 17:38:27	liamdawe	ImperialXT: it was a lot bigger :P
2014-12-11 17:38:37	gnarface	too big
2014-12-11 17:38:43	gnarface	too much jquery

2014-12-11 17:38:46	ImperialXT	and it looks ok...
2014-12-11 17:38:55	gnarface	too little adherence to w3c standards

2014-12-11 17:39:22	stqn	the font is the correct size though
2014-12-11 17:39:28	gnarface	liamdawe: you have unscaped amperands in a feed of links in there that jump right out at me
2014-12-11 17:39:46	liamdawe	gnarface: ooo, where exactly?
2014-12-11 17:39:46	gnarface	liamdawe: in my experience that's a warning sign of a lot worse issues
2014-12-11 17:40:20	gnarface	liamdawe: viewing source on the link you posted, starting at line 149
2014-12-11 17:40:22	liamdawe	ah checking now
2014-12-11 17:40:37	liamdawe	fixing now
2014-12-11 17:41:11	gnarface	its commonly assumed that ampersands don't need to be escaped when they're part of an attribute value, but that's a false assumption and i have no idea where it came from
2014-12-11 17:42:37	gnarface	i also see jquery included on a lot of pages 'just cause' to do stuff you could do with a few lines of css&js
2014-12-11 17:43:08	gnarface	but loading the 5+MB of jquery files just for some mouseover and fading effects really cripples your loading times and usability on mobile
2014-12-11 17:43:24	gnarface	also drains battery like you wouldn't believe
2014-12-11 17:43:52	liamdawe	fixed the & errors
2014-12-11 17:44:04	gnarface	(not to mention the extra cost for people who don't have unlimited mobile bandwidth)
2014-12-11 17:44:39	liamdawe	all our js comes at under 200kb
2014-12-11 17:44:53	liamdawe	where are you seeing 5mb :S
2014-12-11 17:45:14	gnarface	really? not loading all of jquery then? i just saw the string 'jquery' in your script includes and assumed you were loading it all like most people do, sorry
2014-12-11 17:46:25	liamdawe	down to 31 errors on html checker, from 600 because of ampersands...
2014-12-11 17:46:47	gnarface	you should use the official one: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamingonlinux.com%2Fbeta%2Findex.php&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0

2014-12-11 17:46:50	liamdawe	gnarface: no, we only load the base lib, and then include small jquery based stuff as needed
2014-12-11 17:47:20	liamdawe	all js will be minified when live too, this is just for quick editing of the js as needed
2014-12-11 17:47:39	gnarface	meh, i'm not a big fan of minification
2014-12-11 17:47:53	gnarface	inline gz compression usually eats newlines pretty efficiently
2014-12-11 17:48:22	gnarface	if you're not including all of jquery i guess that's the right way to do it
2014-12-11 17:48:38	EXetoC	bacon
2014-12-11 17:48:49	gnarface	getting rid of the validation errors will magically fix a ton of compatibility issues in more obscure browsers
2014-12-11 17:48:57	liamdawe	gnarface: our js and images are all on cache anyway :)
2014-12-11 17:49:19	liamdawe	ill need to ask the designer about most of the errors left up there
2014-12-11 17:49:26	liamdawe	about not allowing src
2014-12-11 17:51:58	gnarface	hmm. not sure what that's about, but it looks like he's pulling in an alternate namespace's tag definitions so he can load svg images
2014-12-11 17:52:36	gnarface	maybe he needs to do the namespace identifier on the tag name too, or maybe he just needs it on the src attribute too, or maybe he just forgot to set the extra namespaces in the header
2014-12-11 17:52:45	gnarface	its been a while since i've screwed with that
2014-12-11 17:55:45	gnarface	yea i think i recall vaguely that you'd want that xlink namespace declared in the header
2014-12-11 17:56:11	gnarface	i never used svgs a lot because you sabotage cross-platform compatibility using them
2014-12-11 17:56:26	gnarface	they're really slick for animated graphics that look super high res but save a ton of bandwidth
2014-12-11 17:56:40	gnarface	but they're unfortunately very poorly supported outside of linux
2014-12-11 17:56:49	gnarface	maybe that's what you're going for though :)
2014-12-11 17:57:46	liamdawe	thats why he put in png as well though to be fair
2014-12-11 17:58:07	BTRE	oh? I hadn't noticed but steam is doing a new thing now
2014-12-11 17:58:12	BTRE	steam auction for a few days
2014-12-11 17:58:20	liamdawe	i've sent him the error report, so we can fix the remaining ones tomorrow, but hey ~30 errors down frm 600 is great
2014-12-11 17:59:52	gnarface	yea most of them will be repetitive
2014-12-11 18:00:21	liamdawe	most are the svg errrs, and a few naming errors with id's being re-used, but not sure the best way to solve that when id is used for some js
2014-12-11 18:00:50	gnarface	personally, i use classes instead
2014-12-11 18:01:05	gnarface	you're not supposed to use an id more than once on a given page
2014-12-11 18:01:37	liamdawe	yeah i know
2014-12-11 18:01:41	gnarface	though most browsers will forgive it, they work around the collisions in different ways, which has chain-reaction type compatibility issues that might be hard to trace
2014-12-11 18:01:58	gnarface	i just try to use a class for everything i can instead basically
2014-12-11 18:02:50	liamdawe	thanks for the feedback :)
2014-12-11 18:02:57	gnarface	yea, no problem
2014-12-11 18:03:22	gnarface	if you test primarily in firefox and don't care how badly the whole thing breaks in IE, alot of the concerns evaporate
2014-12-11 18:03:38	gnarface	safari, chrome, and opera can mostly be trusted to behave themselves
2014-12-11 18:03:59	stqn	So people are saying Metro Redux is downloading now.
2014-12-11 18:04:30	liamdawe	yup

2014-12-11 18:30:46	cr0ne	metro last light redux
2014-12-11 18:31:02	Raven67854	I prefer 2033 but last light's dlc is nicer. I like that tower thing.

2014-12-11 19:47:24	stqn	720p???
2014-12-11 19:47:58	Yamagata	that's what it looks like. the config reverts itself when the game runs but also lists a resolution my monitor won't do (16:10 1920x1200)
2014-12-11 19:48:34	Yamagata	i'm sure that will get worked out, in the mean-time SSAA improves image quality massively. just wish i could go above 2x without tanking my framerate xD

2014-12-12 00:46:46	RavenholmDX	(GTAV)
2014-12-12 00:46:50	RavenholmDX	it's really good
2014-12-12 00:47:28	RavenholmDX	I generally don't look down on console games like a lot of PC gamers do, so I don't mind going with console versions over PC versions if there isn't a linux version
2014-12-12 00:47:47	RavenholmDX	sometimes I actually prefer consoles
2014-12-12 00:48:30	-->	linux_gamer_ (~dominik@p5B028450.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #gamingonlinux
2014-12-12 00:49:08	Leftmost	My issue with consoles is the planned obsolescence.
2014-12-12 00:49:21	Sik	PC gamers who look down on consoles (in general) are just people with a huge ego that deserve being completely ignored
2014-12-12 00:49:25	Sik	Seriously
2014-12-12 00:49:31	Sik	(well, at least when that ego kicks in)
2014-12-12 00:49:33	NuSuey	I do like my ps3, but .. don't want to buy more games for it..maybe last game I would want to play on it would be the diablo 3: ultimate evil edition .. which I could play coop with my gf ..
2014-12-12 00:49:54	NuSuey	but haven't got to buying that yet
2014-12-12 00:50:25	Sik	Leftmost: eh, I'd argue PC in some ways has it worse, computers go outdated insanely fast (sure, they may have backwards compatibility, but try using your current computer 5 years from now and watch how slow it becomes... and 10 years, and forget about running anything new on it)
2014-12-12 00:51:17	Leftmost	Sik, sure, but there are ways to play the games I own that are ten years old. I can't do that with the Playstation games I own.
2014-12-12 00:51:17	Sik	PC has the advantage of backwards compatibility being a given most of the time (for consoles that's the exception), but that doesn't really solve the planned obsolence part
2014-12-12 00:51:31	Sik	It still encourages buying new hardware all the time
2014-12-12 00:52:03	Sik	Not having planned obsolence would mean not encouraging people to ditch their old hardware constantly ;P
2014-12-12 00:52:36	Beamboom	RavenholmDX, I don' tmind consoles either. it's just another platform for games.
2014-12-12 00:52:52	NuSuey	I've come to the conclusion that I dont want to spend more money on consoles, since I have a library of hundreds of games.. in my steam library.. can any console library compare to that? nope..
2014-12-12 00:53:26	<--	trousermonkey (~na@70.134.66.99) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2014-12-12 00:53:33	Leftmost	I'd call it two different kinds of planned obsolescence. Both have the issue of hardware going out of date, but that's pretty much taken for granted considering the nature of computer hardware. Consoles, however, are structured in such a way that you have one hardware provider and have to pay for the same games again if you want to keep playing them.
2014-12-12 00:53:57	Beamboom	Well, the PS3 library could, easily. I've owned at *least* 250 games on the ps3 over the years
2014-12-12 00:54:06	Beamboom	And that's just the games I chose to purchase
2014-12-12 00:54:20	Beamboom	(reply to NuSuey)
2014-12-12 00:56:08	NuSuey	Beamboom: I know but most of them would be discs which you need to store somewhere (or have a reaaally big hdd) or you would have to buy it digitaly..but then you would have to ALLWAYS keep the ps3 to be able to play it
2014-12-12 00:56:43	NuSuey	steam? you just install it anywhere
2014-12-12 00:57:29	linux_gamer_	anyone testesd Metro Redux on mobile nvidia chips?
2014-12-12 00:58:44	chesneyhawkes	should be fine right?
2014-12-12 00:58:51	Beamboom	Yeah of course. That is the annoying thing, but at the same time it's kinda charming. I got my PS3 in the cabin now, offline, with a STACK of good old covers w/discs in them. I like it.
2014-12-12 01:01:22	Sik	Leftmost: um no, you can still use your old console for old games... if anything, the issue is that those games aren't available on newer consoles either (releases on newer platforms are the exception to the rule), so you have to get the old consoles as well. It's more planned obsolence in being locked out of new games than being locked out of old games
2014-12-12 01:01:45	Sik	And the fact the need to buy a new console arises every generation rather than every year or two also helps
2014-12-12 01:01:47	Leftmost	My Playstation is no longer functioning. I can't use my old console for old games.
2014-12-12 01:02:30	Sik	OK, so if the fact that the system I use right now doesn't work in 20 years is planned obsolence then anything is planned obsolence
2014-12-12 01:02:35	RavenholmDX	NuSuey, I have ~200+ digital PS3 games
2014-12-12 01:02:43	RavenholmDX	the only disk games I own, are those not available on PSN
2014-12-12 01:02:47	Sik	(also chances are that PS can be fixed anyway, the drives are fixable a least)
2014-12-12 01:02:48	Leftmost	That's not at all what I said.
2014-12-12 01:03:25	Sik	Yes but it seems like just about anything that would stop you from playing games you owned before and new ones at the same time is planned obsolence
2014-12-12 01:03:29	Sik	:/
2014-12-12 01:03:54	Sik	Which happens even on PC anyway because upgrading the operating system tends to break old games eventually
2014-12-12 01:04:06	Leftmost	Nintendo and Sony have now both made a business out of selling games from previous generations on their newer generations. They have found a way to profit from lack of backward compatibility.
2014-12-12 01:04:14	RavenholmDX	As history have shown us, there'll be ways to play all these old games in the future
2014-12-12 01:04:15	Leftmost	It breaks them, but there are usually workarounds.
2014-12-12 01:04:27	Sik	Not always
2014-12-12 01:04:35	RavenholmDX	PS3 emulation is being worked on
2014-12-12 01:04:47	Leftmost	Anyhow, I have no interest in telling you what to do. I'm arguing my personal position on it.
2014-12-12 01:04:47	Sik	With DOS games pretty much the only reliable thing once the Win9x line was killed was to use DOS emulators
2014-12-12 01:05:05	RavenholmDX	At some point PCs are going to change CPU architecture
2014-12-12 01:05:09	Sik	And even many Windows games accessed the hardware directly so they broke down as well
2014-12-12 01:05:11	RavenholmDX	nothing is safe
2014-12-12 01:05:54	Sik	Eh, PCs would have done it already if it wouldn't blow a huge hole because of breaking some old Windows programs
2014-12-12 01:06:11	RavenholmDX	We're reaching the limitations of x86
2014-12-12 01:06:11	Sik	Remember Intel tried to get rid of x86, didn't work out, then AMD made a 64-bit extension to x64 and that is what took off
2014-12-12 01:06:31	Sik	So it's not like Intel wasn't aware of the issues with x86 either
2014-12-12 01:06:44	RavenholmDX	Well, IMO, it's going to happen sooner or later
2014-12-12 01:06:56	RavenholmDX	and I'm sure they'll work on an x86 compatability layer at first
2014-12-12 01:07:01	Sik	And Microsoft at first tried to encourage developers to switch to javascript for Metro apps (I remember the documentation back then)
2014-12-12 01:07:06	RavenholmDX	possibly even including an x86 processor on the die
2014-12-12 01:07:08	Sik	That didn't take off for some reason
2014-12-12 01:07:22	Sik	(you can still use it, but most use C++ instead)
2014-12-12 01:07:41	RavenholmDX	alot of mobile development seems to be moving that way
2014-12-12 01:07:42	Sik	The original idea was to deploy the same exact app to Windows 8 and to Windows RT
2014-12-12 01:07:53	RavenholmDX	Sik, isn't that the case though?
2014-12-12 01:07:59	RavenholmDX	everything is available on both
2014-12-12 01:08:04	Sik	You need different binaries without javascript
2014-12-12 01:08:10	Sik	(since one runs on x86 and the other on ARM)
2014-12-12 01:08:20	RavenholmDX	oh, makes sense
2014-12-12 01:08:22	Sik	The idea was to avoid that situation in the first place
2014-12-12 01:08:49	Sik	On mobile everybody insists on doing that too but in practice native binaries are pretty much king anyway
2014-12-12 01:08:59	Sik	Apple constantly changing the rules isn't helping matters
2014-12-12 01:09:17	RavenholmDX	I wonder will ARM ever have a place on desktops
2014-12-12 01:09:42	tadzik	well, I know people who have arm laptops
2014-12-12 01:09:43	Sik	Honestly? Backwards compatibility on PC is pretty much the only reason it hasn't already
2014-12-12 01:09:48	Sik	:/
2014-12-12 01:09:57	RavenholmDX	tadzik, yeah, Chromebooks etc.
2014-12-12 01:09:59	Sik	Not like there aren't ARM-based computers
2014-12-12 01:10:12	RavenholmDX	but I mean widespread
2014-12-12 01:10:12	Sik	Heck, even early one :P (Acorn computers were ARM-based)
2014-12-12 01:10:17	Sik	*early ones
2014-12-12 01:10:32	Sik	But yeah, the problem is that the current PC architecture is pretty much the only big one
2014-12-12 01:10:46	tadzik	from a desktop user perspective, I don't see a reason to care about arm on the desktop
2014-12-12 01:10:53	Sik	Though maybe non-64-bit x86 goes down the drain if UEFI becomes spread enough to be safe to assume it
2014-12-12 01:10:58	tadzik	cluttured instruction set? Power consumption? Pfft, who cares
2014-12-12 01:11:06	Sik	(since UEFI can set up the processor for you, avoiding having to go through real mode)
2014-12-12 01:11:15	tadzik	it's a desktop, it pretty much eats a megawatt of power anyway
2014-12-12 01:11:18	Sik	(may as well just boot UEFI right in 64-bit mode)
2014-12-12 01:11:23	tadzik	erm, kilowatt
2014-12-12 01:11:39	RavenholmDX	I wish there was an ARM version of Steam
2014-12-12 01:11:41	Sik	tadzik: pretty much toolset and such
2014-12-12 01:11:44	RavenholmDX	purely for home streaming
2014-12-12 01:11:45	Sik	Compatibility stuff
2014-12-12 01:11:55	Sik	Power usage benefits and such wouldn't really matter in this case
2014-12-12 01:11:56	Beamboom	I agree with tadzik. But then again, I *always* agree with that guy. He speaks truth and logic.
2014-12-12 01:12:00	tadzik	:D
2014-12-12 01:12:09	tadzik	good to hear that :)
2014-12-12 01:12:14	RavenholmDX	I reckon my PC probably uses about 400w
2014-12-12 01:12:19	RavenholmDX	if not less

2014-12-12 01:12:57	RavenholmDX	Sik, OC'd 4670k + GTX 970, 1 SSD, 1 HDD
2014-12-12 01:13:04	Sik	Hmmm OK
2014-12-12 01:13:05	RavenholmDX	about 5 fans + fan controller
2014-12-12 01:13:20	Sik	The SSD should not eat much power though (it should be even less than the hard disk)
2014-12-12 01:13:29	RavenholmDX	Aren't they like, 1w? :P
2014-12-12 01:13:33	Sik	(actually hard disk eats a lot due to the spinning drive :P)
2014-12-12 01:13:35	Sik	lol
2014-12-12 01:13:43	Sik	I wouldn't be surprised if it's below 1W :P
2014-12-12 01:13:48	RavenholmDX	yeah
2014-12-12 01:13:51	Sik	It's pure electronics
2014-12-12 01:14:03	Sik	And not one that's pushing insanely large amounts of calculation, either
2014-12-12 01:14:15	RavenholmDX	You guys see those new 8TB hard drives coming out next year?
2014-12-12 01:14:20	RavenholmDX	new tech
2014-12-12 01:14:32	Sik	CPUs and GPUs use up so much power only because of the speeds at which they run and how much circuit is enabled in the process

2014-12-12 01:26:19	Sik	But c'mon, why are things so slow?
2014-12-12 01:26:30	tadzik	because it's cheaper :)
2014-12-12 01:26:51	Sik	At least it stopped being as bad on mobile because 1) it becomes annoying with touch UIs and 2) it eats battery like hell
2014-12-12 01:27:06	Sik	Now, if we could get that on PCs too... :P

2014-12-12 01:27:54	Sik	Eh, tiny screens still make that hard

2014-12-12 01:41:02	linux_gamer	hi
2014-12-12 01:48:16	tropiko	hi
2014-12-12 01:48:21	tropiko	any of you play Source games on linux?
2014-12-12 01:48:42	tropiko	my linux mint install runs half life 2 pretty poorly, and gets worse the longer it runs
2014-12-12 01:48:45	tropiko	and it's not a heat issue

2014-12-12 01:50:55	gkeen	tropiko: all the source games run perfectly
2014-12-12 01:51:01	gkeen	best ports ever :P
2014-12-12 01:51:14	gkeen	300+ fps
2014-12-12 01:51:29	tropiko	it's a driver issue most likely
2014-12-12 01:51:32	gnarface	hmmm. i remember having a problem with fullscreen antialiasing
2014-12-12 01:51:33	tropiko	I now have artifacts everywhere
2014-12-12 01:51:38	tropiko	and it's not even mildly hot

2014-12-12 01:52:14	tropiko	anyone know how to restart video driver from terminal?
2014-12-12 01:52:17	gkeen	tropiko: everything else run? unigine heaven demo for example?
2014-12-12 01:52:40	gkeen	you mean restart the whole graphical ui? sudo killall xorg ?
2014-12-12 01:52:40	tropiko	it's a quadro fx 570m 256 mb gddr3 (8600m gt equivalent)
2014-12-12 01:53:00	Sik	Hm, weird, Source usually doesn't have issues with hardware (even old one if you ignore the part of requiring GL3)
2014-12-12 01:53:00	tropiko	xorg not found, weird
2014-12-12 01:53:02	Sik	Does anything else break?
2014-12-12 01:53:02	gkeen	the 8000* series sucked :/
2014-12-12 01:53:04	gnarface	that's a pretty old card though...
2014-12-12 01:53:11	tropiko	It runs just fine in windows
2014-12-12 01:53:18	Sik	Windows uses Direct3D though
2014-12-12 01:53:21	tropiko	left 4 dead could run at 60-90 fps on low to mediu
2014-12-12 01:53:27	Sik	Source on Linux uses OpenGL, completely different driver
2014-12-12 01:53:27	gnarface	you're using the official drivers not the nouveau ones right, tropiko ?
2014-12-12 01:53:31	tropiko	and warcraft runs fine in opengl AND d3d

2014-12-12 01:53:52	tropiko	yes I'm using nvidia-current from software manager
2014-12-12 01:53:56	gkeen	old card, may be broken
2014-12-12 01:54:02	Sik	Dying VRAM?
2014-12-12 01:54:10	Sik	Though that'd be an issue even when not running games
2014-12-12 01:55:07	gkeen	Sik: like this? 10:53:45 <tropiko> brb restarting, I can't see text because of artifacts

2014-12-12 01:56:16	tropiko	this one has a good card
2014-12-12 01:56:16	Sik	If the artifacts happen even without running Source then that immediately says something else is broken

2014-12-12 01:56:28	tropiko	it's the linux driver I tell you, cause windows runs just fine
2014-12-12 01:56:45	Sik	tropiko: running Source results in things breaking up permanently until restart, right?
2014-12-12 01:56:46	tropiko	half life 2 at a lower res looks great on opengl somehow
2014-12-12 01:56:50	tropiko	no
2014-12-12 01:56:58	Sik	Well, it was meant for lower resolutions originally...
2014-12-12 01:57:01	tropiko	just had artifacts randomly, not running anything 3d
2014-12-12 01:57:07	gkeen	tropiko: try a newer version?
2014-12-12 01:57:08	Sik	Did you run Source before?
2014-12-12 01:57:11	tropiko	yes
2014-12-12 01:57:13	Sik	OK
2014-12-12 01:57:21	gkeen	also make sure the driver is also working/being used
2014-12-12 01:57:23	tropiko	and I had an older version of ubuntu run it better in wine than this native one
2014-12-12 01:57:48	tropiko	I can't install steam propely on ubuntu though, I had to go through many hoops on ubuntu, linux mint was just 2 clicks with soft manager
2014-12-12 01:57:56	Sik	Hmmm, ask Valve support? (·· ) (dunno how much attention they pay to it)
2014-12-12 01:58:06	Sik	And huh weird
2014-12-12 01:58:07	tropiko	on ubuntu I could install windows, had to kill nouveau and xorg or whatever and install it manually from nvidia
2014-12-12 01:58:19	Sik	Steam should install really easily on Ubuntu
2014-12-12 01:58:19	tropiko	and after driver was installed, and I guarantee you it was installed
2014-12-12 01:58:22	tropiko	steam just wouldn't start
2014-12-12 01:58:35	tropiko	on linux mint I just used software manager on driver and steam and it works
2014-12-12 01:58:43	tropiko	though not the performance I was expecting
2014-12-12 01:58:46	tropiko	WINE was running them better
2014-12-12 01:58:48	tropiko	something is wrong
2014-12-12 01:58:54	Sik	Steam isn't exactly the best performant thing either...
2014-12-12 01:58:59	tropiko	no
2014-12-12 01:59:03	tropiko	but steam on wine ran better than native
2014-12-12 01:59:04	tropiko	that's my issue
2014-12-12 01:59:14	gkeen	what ubuntu version is this?
2014-12-12 01:59:17	Sik	I remember that with my previous computer big screen would immediately lock me out of any video
2014-12-12 01:59:29	Sik	Not anymore on this laptop
2014-12-12 01:59:32	Sik	Oh and yeah that
2014-12-12 01:59:35	tropiko	granted it was on ubuntu 10.04 many years ago, and I use linux mint latest
2014-12-12 01:59:41	tropiko	now
2014-12-12 01:59:42	Sik	Needs 12.04
2014-12-12 01:59:49	Sik	Even on 11.10 it'll refuse to install
2014-12-12 01:59:54	Sik	(yeah, explicit check)
2014-12-12 01:59:57	tropiko	no, I mean I used wine on ubuntu before and it was better than native on linux mint now
2014-12-12 02:00:02	Sik	Oh
2014-12-12 02:00:11	tropiko	how do I make sure the driver is initialized
2014-12-12 02:00:16	Sik	Huh
2014-12-12 02:00:19	Sik	It should initialize with X
2014-12-12 02:00:21	tropiko	and how the hell can graphics work if it isn't
2014-12-12 02:00:33	tadzik	csgo still has some issues, but they generally work pretty well
2014-12-12 02:00:35	tadzik	(source games)
2014-12-12 02:00:46	Sik	Graphics can work with VESA >.> ...sometime
2014-12-12 02:00:47	tadzik	(slowpoke)
2014-12-12 02:00:48	Sik	*sometimes
2014-12-12 02:00:57	Sik	But that means the driver hasn't been booted
2014-12-12 02:01:00	gkeen	tadzik: csgo issues??
2014-12-12 02:01:02	Sik	And will require restarting X to boot
2014-12-12 02:01:11	tropiko	csgo is the most demanding source game for my laptop, least playable even in windows
2014-12-12 02:01:25	tadzik	gkeen: yeah, framerate drops when showing the scoreboard, mostly
2014-12-12 02:01:35	tropiko	on old cpus yeah I've noticed that
2014-12-12 02:01:43	tadzik	and once I had my framerate drop to like 2 fps during a competitive match, that wasn't fun
2014-12-12 02:01:48	gkeen	tadzik: yeah i noticed that too, but thats a "new" bug it didnt used todo that :/
2014-12-12 02:01:59	tadzik	on the other hand, a windows teammate crashed to desktop twice during that same match, so linux still wins
2014-12-12 02:02:02	gkeen	get a better pc :P
2014-12-12 02:02:11	tadzik	it's a 770 >:(
2014-12-12 02:02:16	tropiko	lol
2014-12-12 02:02:17	Sik	Wait, the scoreboard slows it down?
2014-12-12 02:02:22	gkeen	my friends game dropped to 0 fps yesterday, on the new Train map
2014-12-12 02:02:25	gkeen	he uses Windows :P
2014-12-12 02:02:26	tropiko	my 770 in windows = 200-300 fps
2014-12-12 02:02:27	Sik	I think the last time I saw UI slowing down the game was in Duke Nukem 3D :P
2014-12-12 02:02:31	gkeen	i was way up in 300 fps
2014-12-12 02:02:34	Sik	(since the 3D engine is in asm but the UI is in C)
2014-12-12 02:02:45	tadzik	you know what helps? removing some .swf from the game files
2014-12-12 02:02:55	Sik	...
2014-12-12 02:02:59	Sik	It uses Flash?
2014-12-12 02:03:06	gkeen	what? :O
2014-12-12 02:03:07	tadzik	apparently
2014-12-12 02:03:13	Sik	That explains A LOT

2014-12-12 02:09:19	tropiko	I get 50-160 fps in 740x480 and looks decent even though it's so small res
2014-12-12 02:09:22	Dezponia	gkeen: Both games?
2014-12-12 02:09:23	gkeen	Dezponia: gonna see if i can get it cheap somewhere :P
2014-12-12 02:09:27	tropiko	but 30-60 fps in 1280x800 native
2014-12-12 02:09:33	tropiko	I had 60-90 on windows
2014-12-12 02:09:35	tropiko	so bleh
2014-12-12 02:09:39	Dezponia	gkeen: Its on sale on steam. Don think you'll find it much cheaper
2014-12-12 02:09:44	tropiko	at least half life 1 is native opengl
2014-12-12 02:09:59	gkeen	Dezponia: you can always find cheaper than steam :P

2014-12-12 02:13:15	Dezponia	gkeen: Think they wanted to change how the repo package naming was working so they just frooze the name mid release. I'm sure they'll give it a version-agnostic name eventually

2014-12-12 02:23:14	tadzik	there's no netflix in 2nd world countries too :/
2014-12-12 02:23:22	NuSuey	RavenholmDX: not slovak subitles
2014-12-12 02:23:29	RavenholmDX	oh
2014-12-12 02:23:52	RavenholmDX	Netflix is overrated anyway
2014-12-12 02:23:59	RavenholmDX	it's nice to have when you have no idea what to watch
2014-12-12 02:24:01	NuSuey	i'm trying out http://subflicks.com/ to get past that and put the subtitles in netflix, but some subtitles work, some don't .. need to fiddle with it a bit
2014-12-12 02:24:03	GolliumBot	[ SubFlicks - Subtitles for Netflix ] - subflicks.com
2014-12-12 02:24:03	Dezponia	NuSuey: I get that. But I then opt to not consume that content. If the content is not available in a DRM free form (or effectively DRM free like DVD's outside the US with libdvdcss) I dont consume it. This goes for media though. Games are tricker but its also one of the only exceptions I still make
2014-12-12 02:24:04	RavenholmDX	but the selection isn't great
2014-12-12 02:24:45	tadzik	well, I don't really see any legal way to watch series I want
2014-12-12 02:25:05	RavenholmDX	Buy them on DVD?
2014-12-12 02:25:26	Dezponia	Yepp, DVD is surely an option. If its not out on DVD yet then I dont watch it until it is
2014-12-12 02:25:46	RavenholmDX	I generally don't pirate movies
2014-12-12 02:25:53	RavenholmDX	I have an unlimited pass for the cinema
2014-12-12 02:25:59	RavenholmDX	so get to see everything I want to
2014-12-12 02:26:15	Dezponia	I will buy bluray/DVD combo packs if available since I'm looking forward to the day GNU/Linux will support bluray well. But I dont buy exlusivley bluray since unlike DVD's they dont work well yet
2014-12-12 02:26:17	RavenholmDX	and by the time I might want to rewatch any of them
2014-12-12 02:26:25	RavenholmDX	they're usually on Netflix/Rental services
2014-12-12 02:26:31	NuSuey	lol last time I wanted to buy something on DVD it was available .. but they would deliver it within 2-3 WEEKS! fuck WEEKS
2014-12-12 02:26:39	Dezponia	At least blurays dont work well yet with Free Software which is something I want to stick with
2014-12-12 02:26:52	RavenholmDX	there's ways to watch them isn't there?
2014-12-12 02:27:03	RavenholmDX	like streaming the video stream right off the disk
2014-12-12 02:27:14	Dezponia	NuSuey: Not a problem for me. I order stuff from the US all the time and wait for it to arrive since the selection on amazon.com etc is much bigger there

2014-12-12 02:28:22	Dezponia	RavenholmDX: I never said it was cheap but my principles are stronger than that. And money is not a huge concern for me luckily
2014-12-12 02:28:23	RavenholmDX	I remember last christmas, I ordered books from Amazon.com
2014-12-12 02:28:28	RavenholmDX	paid more for shipping

2014-12-12 02:28:52	RavenholmDX	so it's easy to decide :P
2014-12-12 02:29:22	RavenholmDX	The only media I buy physically these days are current generation console games
2014-12-12 02:29:32	RavenholmDX	because screw downloading 50+GB
2014-12-12 02:29:34	Dezponia	I totally understand that people less fortunate opt for piracy etc and I do belive culture should be shared freely for non-commercial benefit. However until the laws are changed to reflect that I will abide by them
2014-12-12 02:30:03	RavenholmDX	Piracy shouldn't be criminalized anyway
2014-12-12 02:30:08	RavenholmDX	Distribution should
2014-12-12 02:30:46	NuSuey	Dezponia: I have no problem with paying for stuff.. I buy games (have ~ 300 games in steam) but TV series and movies are something that is a) not available for months b) overpriced as fuck  in my country

2014-12-12 02:30:56	NuSuey	mostly a)
2014-12-12 02:30:59	Dezponia	Luckily we have the pirate party which is a nice way of pushing for those legislation changes politically. Its a uphill fight but with the recent developments regarding privacy online etc I dont think a few % of votes on PP could hurt :)
2014-12-12 02:31:17	NuSuey	but I guess google movies are now available and they keep putting some movies in with slovak subtitles too
2014-12-12 02:31:29	NuSuey	it's slow.. it's coming
2014-12-12 02:31:32	NuSuey	*but
2014-12-12 02:31:46	RavenholmDX	If there was a service offering DRM free movies
2014-12-12 02:31:54	RavenholmDX	I'd spend so much money
2014-12-12 02:32:10	RavenholmDX	(GOG.com has a small selection I know)
2014-12-12 02:32:16	Pyrus	I'm reasonably glad that piracy is perfectly legal here
2014-12-12 02:32:23	RavenholmDX	Where's here?
2014-12-12 02:32:26	Pyrus	austria
2014-12-12 02:32:51	RavenholmDX	ah
2014-12-12 02:32:53	Dezponia	RavenholmDX: for me I use DVD's like that. Not as conveniant as online but at least I can legally rip them to DRM free backups in my country and I can do so using only free software since patent laws are not insane here and the DMCA is not a thing :)
2014-12-12 02:33:07	Dezponia	Pyrus: Great!
2014-12-12 02:33:16	RavenholmDX	Piracy is illegal here I guess
2014-12-12 02:33:22	RavenholmDX	but in practice, nobody cares
2014-12-12 02:33:29	Dezponia	Anyway I'm off to do WORK snd stuff. Cant imagine why that would be needed but whatever, apparently its something that needs to be done for food and whatnot
2014-12-12 02:35:00	RavenholmDX	do what I do
2014-12-12 02:35:05	RavenholmDX	work AND IRC

2014-12-12 02:39:31	RavenholmDX	the market is far bigger outside of North America
2014-12-12 02:40:08	RavenholmDX	almost everyone I know doesn't have a cable subscription any more
2014-12-12 02:40:09	RavenholmDX	it's crazy
2014-12-12 02:40:21	RavenholmDX	Netflix and OTA
2014-12-12 02:40:32	NuSuey	I want to be able to come home, sit on the couch - open something, pay some euros to buy it - watch it instantly with ton of various language / subtitles available
2014-12-12 02:41:19	RavenholmDX	pity Netflix doesn't just hook in with OpenSubtitles or whatever
2014-12-12 02:41:21	NuSuey	or watch something I want - with some ad breaks
2014-12-12 02:41:41	NuSuey	RavenholmDX: like I said - there is a way how to get subtitles in there
2014-12-12 02:41:43	RavenholmDX	and say like, here's our official subtitles, but if you want, here's subtitles available on OpenSubtitles
2014-12-12 02:41:47	NuSuey	RavenholmDX: http://subflicks.com/ for example

2014-12-12 02:42:11	RavenholmDX	NuSuey, only on PC though right?
2014-12-12 02:42:18	NuSuey	you need to press CTRL, ALT, SHIFT + T ..and you can put subtitles in netflix window
2014-12-12 02:42:32	NuSuey	nah you can put external subtitles in it.. buy you have to convert them to that format
2014-12-12 02:42:56	RavenholmDX	yeah, but I mean, it only works with Netflix through a PC web browser right?
2014-12-12 02:42:58	NuSuey	and you need to use the correct timing which can be a pain in the ass
2014-12-12 02:43:08	RavenholmDX	it's not a solution for TV/console apps

2014-12-12 02:50:26	NuSuey	wait you can't coop the campaign
2014-12-12 02:50:33	tropiko	no, but there's custom maps for that

2014-12-12 02:51:57	xpander69	someone said my name..yes redux works.. performance is so so .. everything at default is smooth.. but cranking up higher makes the game choke... well my gpu is pretty weak also (660TI) so its expected really
2014-12-12 02:52:14	tropiko	metro eats up graphics cards like it's nothing
2014-12-12 02:52:27	tropiko	doesn't look that good to be honest but whatever

2014-12-12 02:52:30	xpander69	tesselation is the thing that kills it i think
2014-12-12 02:52:31	tropiko	redux should work better than 2033
2014-12-12 02:52:41	xpander69	but like always we linux users dont have slider for it

2014-12-12 02:53:32	xpander69	gkeen, shadows have some weird pixels in redux
2014-12-12 02:53:38	xpander69	no matter how high the quality is cranked

2014-12-12 02:56:47	tropiko	just start smaller?
2014-12-12 02:56:53	RavenholmDX	I'm just lazy
2014-12-12 02:56:56	tropiko	or have a clear goal, else motivation will fail you

2014-12-12 03:00:41	RavenholmDX	wondering how my 970 will do
2014-12-12 03:00:46	xpander69	sebbu, 8600GT is even weaker i guess...
2014-12-12 03:00:51	sebbu	xpander69, yep :p
2014-12-12 03:01:00	xpander69	im quite sure 970 will run it perfectly

2014-12-12 03:01:07	xpander69	its in my buy list as well:D

2014-12-12 03:01:14	sebbu	:p
2014-12-12 03:01:21	xpander69	it was?
2014-12-12 03:01:24	xpander69	i dont recall
2014-12-12 03:01:27	RavenholmDX	sebbu, 7 years ago :P
2014-12-12 03:01:37	sebbu	my pc is 7 years old :p
2014-12-12 03:01:38	xpander69	i used 8800GTS and that even wasnt the best back in the days:D well it was ok for most things
2014-12-12 03:01:42	tropiko	7 years ago I had a dual pentium 3 machine with geforce ti4200
2014-12-12 03:01:44	tropiko	so don't complain
2014-12-12 03:01:51	RavenholmDX	xpander69, 8600GT was decent
2014-12-12 03:02:00	RavenholmDX	was the 750Ti of it's day
2014-12-12 03:02:00	xpander69	decent yeah
2014-12-12 03:02:00	sebbu	xpander69, well, the game i play aren't the most ressources hungry
2014-12-12 03:02:05	xpander69	like todays 650Ti or something
2014-12-12 03:02:13	xpander69	or that
2014-12-12 03:02:13	tropiko	idd
2014-12-12 03:02:14	xpander69	yeah
2014-12-12 03:02:25	gkeen	tropiko: added u i think
2014-12-12 03:02:28	gkeen	:P
2014-12-12 03:02:33	xpander69	750Ti is bare minimum for gaming imo :D
2014-12-12 03:02:37	tropiko	I'd reccomend you always buy the second highest tier you can
2014-12-12 03:02:38	tropiko	just save money
2014-12-12 03:02:42	tropiko	it will save you money in the long run
2014-12-12 03:02:50	tropiko	like buy a 970 if you're on a hd monitor or 1440p
2014-12-12 03:03:01	tropiko	even though amd is more tempting atm
2014-12-12 03:03:04	sebbu	civ5 works with default settings with the hd 4000 in 1280*800 (default screen resolution)
2014-12-12 03:03:06	tropiko	btw which is better for linux at the moment?
2014-12-12 03:03:07	xpander69	i recomment to not waste on CPU and use the money for better GPU instead always
2014-12-12 03:03:09	tropiko	amd or nvidia?
2014-12-12 03:03:11	xpander69	if you are gamer
2014-12-12 03:03:40	xpander69	100-140€ CPU and 200-400€ GPU
2014-12-12 03:03:41	xpander69	:D
2014-12-12 03:04:10	tropiko	something like that
2014-12-12 03:04:34	tropiko	100 past 2 weeks oO
2014-12-12 03:05:09	xpander69	100?
2014-12-12 03:05:25	tropiko	hours, nvm
2014-12-12 03:05:32	xpander69	ohh
2014-12-12 03:06:01	sebbu	100 hours is doable in A week
2014-12-12 03:06:18	tropiko	dunno I don't play much multiplayer
2014-12-12 03:06:23	xpander69	i freaking got sucked back into World of Warcraft...stupid friends:D ..didnt play it since 2010 ...now they made me play again:D

2014-12-12 03:06:36	xpander69	at least it runs superbly under linux..like a native game..but all the time it takes:D

2014-12-12 03:07:13	tropiko	mack & mesh, these guys could've been the pewdiepie of today if they weren't sucked into WoW
2014-12-12 03:07:56	xpander69	too lazy to watch the entire video:D
2014-12-12 03:08:29	xpander69	i dont like pwediepie
2014-12-12 03:08:47	xpander69	i dont like hes screaming and trying to be funny
2014-12-12 03:09:06	xpander69	but many people do like..so yeah
2014-12-12 03:10:08	tropiko	I mean as in viewer numbers
2014-12-12 03:10:21	tropiko	wow is a hell of a drug
2014-12-12 03:10:44	xpander69	it is...but i dont think it will last long
2014-12-12 03:10:54	xpander69	cause i dont care about PvE content much..dungeons and raids are not for me
2014-12-12 03:11:03	xpander69	and WoW lacks serious PvP stuff
2014-12-12 03:11:06	tropiko	I'm dissapointed (since 2004) that blizzard won't be making a proper rts like warcraft 3 anymore
2014-12-12 03:11:22	tropiko	yes, I am hipster like that
2014-12-12 03:11:49	Cheeseness	You don't like SC2 much?
2014-12-12 03:11:51	xpander69	warcraft 3 is still the best rts game for me
2014-12-12 03:12:00	tropiko	I liked sc2 ladder for a bit
2014-12-12 03:12:01	xpander69	i dont like starcraft sadly
2014-12-12 03:12:07	tropiko	the campaign was bland compared to wc3
2014-12-12 03:12:19	Cheeseness	I found it hard to get into WC3
2014-12-12 03:12:36	tropiko	and you can't have medieval cool rpgs like in wc3 with the vanilla resources of Sc2
2014-12-12 03:12:36	Cheeseness	(story, that is - Arthas is so lame it's offputting)
2014-12-12 03:12:51	tropiko	I got into it easily cause I was like 6-7 when I first tried it
2014-12-12 03:12:56	tropiko	learning english and all
2014-12-12 03:13:13	Cheeseness	:)
2014-12-12 03:13:13	xpander69	ohh i feel so old now
2014-12-12 03:13:15	xpander69	:(
2014-12-12 03:13:18	Cheeseness	lol
2014-12-12 03:13:35	xpander69	thanks for ruining my day :D
2014-12-12 03:13:38	tropiko	I still remember the joy of finding the custom maps, me and my sister were so bored WarChasers was like a totally new game
2014-12-12 03:13:54	tropiko	old and wise :)
2014-12-12 03:14:20	xpander69	i was 14 when i played warcraft 3 i think
2014-12-12 03:14:58	tropiko	I link all my childhood memories (though I still am a kid, at 18) with the games I played at the time
2014-12-12 03:15:17	tropiko	and every year or two I replay them
2014-12-12 03:15:22	xpander69	but i remember seeing WoW advertisment on TV where Tauren was Fishing etc...and i was still into wc3 back then...and then when i saw the advertisment i was like..wooow..that game i have to get:D
2014-12-12 03:15:24	linux_gamer	is Redux playable with 650m?
2014-12-12 03:15:34	xpander69	i always wondered what would it be to play WC3 in thirdperson mode:D
2014-12-12 03:15:44	tropiko	there's a wc3 first person custom map
2014-12-12 03:15:50	xpander69	i know
2014-12-12 03:16:00	tropiko	it's amazing how people can make stuff like that

2014-12-12 03:16:05	xpander69	yeah
2014-12-12 03:16:10	tropiko	hell, icefrog didn't even make dota and now has a career at Valve
2014-12-12 03:16:17	linux_gamer	btw send request to you xpander
2014-12-12 03:16:32	xpander69	linux_gamer, the minimum is 460 ..so 650 desktop version should be pretty much same perf as 460
2014-12-12 03:16:39	xpander69	but m i think is weaker
2014-12-12 03:16:45	xpander69	linux_gamer, accepted
2014-12-12 03:16:47	linux_gamer	its mobile but 2gb
2014-12-12 03:16:53	linux_gamer	ty
2014-12-12 03:16:56	tropiko	650 is technically weaker but it's newer so it should be faster than 460
2014-12-12 03:16:58	tropiko	I've tried both
2014-12-12 03:17:02	tropiko	(in windows)
2014-12-12 03:17:06	xpander69	gigabytes doesnt matter really if its not up to speed
2014-12-12 03:17:14	xpander69	it cant fill those gigabytes fast enough:D
2014-12-12 03:17:20	tropiko	didn't the first 512bit card came out in 2007 or something
2014-12-12 03:17:25	tropiko	2900xt
2014-12-12 03:17:29	linux_gamer	but is min req. 2BiB
2014-12-12 03:17:32	linux_gamer	GiB
2014-12-12 03:17:38	tropiko	WHY DO YOU USE GiB
2014-12-12 03:17:40	tropiko	it's GB
2014-12-12 03:17:42	tropiko	GIGABYTES
2014-12-12 03:17:48	tropiko	what even is GiB

2014-12-12 03:18:18	xpander69	GB is like metric :D
2014-12-12 03:18:40	linux_gamer	2^10>1000
2014-12-12 03:19:03	tropiko	oh
2014-12-12 03:19:07	tropiko	damn
2014-12-12 03:19:11	tropiko	I just realized the difference
2014-12-12 03:19:12	tropiko	yeah
2014-12-12 03:19:24	xpander69	linux world is operating in GiB, MiB  etc mostly
2014-12-12 03:19:26	linux_gamer	Gb is used by hard drive companies
2014-12-12 03:19:36	xpander69	Hard Disk vendors ofc like to put GB cause its higher number then:D
2014-12-12 03:19:38	xpander69	or TB
2014-12-12 03:19:41	tropiko	that's why gb in hard drives tells you 1tb but in reality windows sees 970 or less
2014-12-12 03:19:47	linux_gamer	yes
2014-12-12 03:20:00	tropiko	i thought that was a filesystem problem
2014-12-12 03:20:15	linux_gamer	and some space is reserved, but thats a scam to me
2014-12-12 03:20:22	xpander69	filesystem problem is also..2TB disk means you loose ~25GB on ext4
2014-12-12 03:20:32	xpander69	you can ofc change it
2014-12-12 03:20:32	Sik	<xpander69> linux world is operating in GiB, MiB  etc mostly
2014-12-12 03:20:35	Sik	Unless it's Ubuntu
2014-12-12 03:20:46	Sik	Then it's metric system for byte sizes and no way to change it back
2014-12-12 03:20:47	Sik	>:(
2014-12-12 03:20:52	tropiko	I guess ubuntu isn't viewed nicely in this chat eh?
2014-12-12 03:20:55	linux_gamer	7,7 GiB
2014-12-12 03:21:02	xpander69	tropiko, why?:D
2014-12-12 03:21:03	linux_gamer	info @ubuntu
2014-12-12 03:21:12	tropiko	dunno, it's too mainstream :P ?
2014-12-12 03:21:12	linux_gamer	strange
2014-12-12 03:21:20	tropiko	I had a bunch of problems with ubuntu I don't have now with mint
2014-12-12 03:21:21	xpander69	doesnt matter if its mainstream
2014-12-12 03:21:27	xpander69	if people like it then what ever:D
2014-12-12 03:21:33	tropiko	on a new install
2014-12-12 03:21:34	xpander69	we have choices
2014-12-12 03:21:35	xpander69	:P
2014-12-12 03:21:45	tropiko	do we? I see so many distros based on ubuntu
2014-12-12 03:21:57	xpander69	you dont see enough then:D
2014-12-12 03:21:58	tropiko	it's spreading like cancer
2014-12-12 03:22:01	tropiko	I don't that's true
2014-12-12 03:22:30	xpander69	ofc it has more distros that are based off of it..because its popular
2014-12-12 03:22:35	linux_gamer	Metro,i think ill buy it and then we see, if theres a new pc someday thats even better, dont have much time but try to push linux sales
2014-12-12 03:22:35	xpander69	but that doesnt mean we dont have others
2014-12-12 03:22:39	Sik	Er, just check the last survey
2014-12-12 03:22:49	Sik	There were two distro branches taking everything
2014-12-12 03:22:50	tropiko	2nd popular after mint
2014-12-12 03:22:54	Sik	So yeah it's not just Ubuntu
2014-12-12 03:22:57	tropiko	zorinOS is ubuntu I think
2014-12-12 03:23:05	xpander69	linux_gamer, i think it will work... and on medium or low settings it might be playable also
2014-12-12 03:23:32	tropiko	anyone use steamOS?
2014-12-12 03:23:33	tropiko	or tried
2014-12-12 03:23:34	linux_gamer	ill try if its more optimized it may run better than original LL
2014-12-12 03:23:41	xpander69	tropiko, no
2014-12-12 03:23:49	xpander69	i dont like console approach:D
2014-12-12 03:24:16	xpander69	linux_gamer, i'd say vice versa for me... original LL ran flawlessly for me
2014-12-12 03:24:19	linux_gamer	shouldn't be worse than ubunt, hopefully better driver updates
2014-12-12 03:24:23	xpander69	while thisone has some drops here and there
2014-12-12 03:24:28	tadzik	LL even ran for me on HD4000 :)
2014-12-12 03:24:49	tropiko	ewww
2014-12-12 03:24:54	linux_gamer	didnt't try sometimes i miss the optirun %command%

2014-12-12 04:12:21	tadzik	but working 60%
2014-12-12 04:12:24	tadzik	(yay for more playtime)
2014-12-12 04:12:33	tropiko	do you have a fixed schedule or?
2014-12-12 04:12:39	tadzik	yeah, 3 full days a week
2014-12-12 04:12:43	tadzik	(usually)
2014-12-12 04:13:07	tropiko	I was going to make a sarcastic remark but I don't know how tough it is
2014-12-12 04:13:18	tadzik	don't worry, I have a thick skin ;)
2014-12-12 04:13:52	tropiko	what do you program, and what do you use?
2014-12-12 04:14:01	tadzik	server side stuff, and mostly python these days
2014-12-12 04:14:06	tropiko	python for servers?
2014-12-12 04:14:09	tadzik	yeah
2014-12-12 04:14:27	tropiko	I'm curious cause I might want to do something like that on the side
2014-12-12 04:14:54	tadzik	it's okay. The devops part is a bit annoying though
2014-12-12 04:15:09	tadzik	quite often it's 20% time spent coding, then 80% fightning with servers
2014-12-12 04:15:13	tropiko	I just got out of highschool and am studying for medschool, getting in will be easy but I want to keep my passion for computers
2014-12-12 04:15:39	tropiko	I was thinking of studying for a cisco cert to get into that side of the business
2014-12-12 04:15:39	tadzik	it may be easier if you don't do that proffesionally :)
2014-12-12 04:15:46	tropiko	which
2014-12-12 04:15:54	tadzik	I mean, I lost a lot of fun from doing this stuff when I started doing it for money
2014-12-12 04:16:01	tropiko	oh
2014-12-12 04:16:05	tadzik	might be just me
2014-12-12 04:16:22	tadzik	but when I was studying I'd get back home after classess and do coding for fun
2014-12-12 04:16:30	tadzik	now I get back from work and I don't feel like it anymore

2014-12-12 04:37:57	gkeen	:P
2014-12-12 04:38:12	RavenholmDX	NuSuey, how does Diablo 3 work on Wine?
2014-12-12 04:38:44	xpander69	NuSuey, i dont think it will be super tiny..im quite sure there are lots of linux players who play this...the other question is..how to find them :D
2014-12-12 04:40:20	xpander69	if we take steam hardware survey it says roughly 1% linux gamers..that would meen 100k for WoW if it has 10 mil active players atm...so now we take that GoL survey... ~33% use wine for gaming also...that would mean we got like 20-30k linux players:D
2014-12-12 04:40:53	xpander69	i know its random stats though:D

2014-12-12 04:43:04	RavenholmDX	I just really don't like using Wine :P
2014-12-12 04:43:06	NuSuey	don't have it .. but it should
2014-12-12 04:43:38	RavenholmDX	What's the best way to install/setup Wine these days?
2014-12-12 04:43:52	RavenholmDX	I remember PlayOnLinux being the big one back in the day
2014-12-12 04:44:35	xpander69	i dont like POL myself im using standalone scripts like that:

2014-12-12 04:44:46	stqn	I’ve had more success with POL than straight Wine for The Witcher 1, but usually I just use Wine.
2014-12-12 04:44:51	xpander69	so i can change prefixes and wine versions how i want
2014-12-12 04:46:02	RavenholmDX	how about Wine bottles?
2014-12-12 04:46:07	sigz	diablo works fine on my end on POL, but framerate does never go over 50fps ( i have a 770gtx and a i5 4690k ), when on windows it is stable at more than 120fps
2014-12-12 04:46:13	stqn	he, IIRC the gl threaded optims were making WoW super slow here
2014-12-12 04:46:23	stqn	-he+eh
2014-12-12 04:46:30	xpander69	for me its making super fast :D
2014-12-12 04:46:32	stqn	but I have the 32 bit version
2014-12-12 04:46:40	xpander69	but i do have AMD FX which sucks at singlethreading
2014-12-12 04:46:40	xpander69	so :D
2014-12-12 04:46:52	RavenholmDX	Hmm, stqn that's disappointing
2014-12-12 04:46:52	xpander69	32bit version has microstutter for me
2014-12-12 04:46:54	stqn	ah, good. I have Core i3
2014-12-12 04:46:56	xpander69	64bit is smooth
2014-12-12 04:47:00	RavenholmDX	last time I played Diablo, I was getting like 180FPS
2014-12-12 04:47:02	xpander69	well that explains
2014-12-12 04:47:05	xpander69	i3 is just 2 cores?
2014-12-12 04:47:11	xpander69	1 for wow and other for wineserver
2014-12-12 04:47:17	xpander69	so no spare for GL_THREADED

2014-12-12 04:47:28	RavenholmDX	stqn, 4690k is an i5
2014-12-12 04:47:37	RavenholmDX	oh, sigz said that
2014-12-12 04:47:41	RavenholmDX	oops
2014-12-12 04:47:59	xpander69	yes yours should be fine with GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS
2014-12-12 04:48:03	xpander69	quite a boost
2014-12-12 04:48:24	RavenholmDX	should GL_THREADED* fix low GPU usage in games?
2014-12-12 04:48:31	RavenholmDX	In BL2, I only see like 30% GPU usage
2014-12-12 04:48:32	linux_gamer	to me the command did not work strangly didnt start
2014-12-12 04:48:36	xpander69	not really
2014-12-12 04:48:44	xpander69	all it does its pushing the rendering to another thread
2014-12-12 04:48:51	xpander69	and shader compiling
2014-12-12 04:49:08	stqn	RavenholmDX: it helps in BL2 yes, BL2 is purely single-threaded (or at least "single-cored" :P)
2014-12-12 04:49:24	xpander69	yes it helps..but not with GPU usage:D
2014-12-12 04:49:27	sigz	how do you activate gl_threaded on bl2 ?
2014-12-12 04:49:43	xpander69	GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command%
2014-12-12 04:49:44	stqn	xpander69: well if it draws more frames per second, it must use the GPU more
2014-12-12 04:49:46	RavenholmDX	in the steam launch properties I believe
2014-12-12 04:49:47	xpander69	into steam launch options
2014-12-12 04:49:55	sigz	oh ok
2014-12-12 04:50:04	xpander69	__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 %command%
2014-12-12 04:50:06	xpander69	like that
2014-12-12 04:50:12	xpander69	forgot __ :D
2014-12-12 04:50:20	RavenholmDX	will that work for all games?
2014-12-12 04:50:27	sigz	and is this a tweak also for wine  ?
2014-12-12 04:50:32	xpander69	yes
2014-12-12 04:50:35	xpander69	with export on front
2014-12-12 04:50:42	xpander69	and no %command%
2014-12-12 04:50:48	stqn	RavenholmDX: yes, it’s the nvidia driver that detects this env-var
2014-12-12 04:50:51	NuSuey	hmm I have only one problem with wine.. It opens the battle.net client on my 3rd monitor (TV) which is turned off mostly, so I need to ALT F7 the window and move it to the left till I see it :/
2014-12-12 04:50:53	xpander69	just like export __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 wine /your/program.exe

2014-12-12 04:51:21	xpander69	cause AMD cards dont have it
2014-12-12 04:51:25	NuSuey	GLORIOUS NVIDIA MASTER RACE!
2014-12-12 04:51:30	stqn	RavenholmDX: because depending on the hardware and game it makes things slower :)
2014-12-12 04:51:38	RavenholmDX	ah okay
2014-12-12 04:51:47	xpander69	and with i3 it might make slower
2014-12-12 04:52:01	xpander69	some games use it by default though
2014-12-12 04:52:20	xpander69	like Metro Games... Serious Sam 3, Unity5(not unity4 sadly) games
2014-12-12 04:52:26	stqn	or really?
2014-12-12 04:52:36	xpander69	yes
2014-12-12 04:52:46	xpander69	when you put that command for unity5 game you get crash:D
2014-12-12 04:52:49	xpander69	because its double then:D
2014-12-12 04:52:59	stqn	err it makes no sense
2014-12-12 04:53:25	NuSuey	xpander69: tried out heroes of the storm yet?
2014-12-12 04:53:35	stqn	setting a variable twice shouldn’t make anything crash
2014-12-12 04:53:39	xpander69	what is heroes of storm?
2014-12-12 04:53:48	xpander69	ahh that MOBA of blizz?..not intersted
2014-12-12 04:54:08	xpander69	stqn, welcome to world of unity :D
2014-12-12 04:54:18	xpander69	other games that use that by defualt dont do that
2014-12-12 04:54:24	NuSuey	ah okay :) just tried it out and it was super fun, and much quicker match than dota
2014-12-12 04:55:02	xpander69	with moba's we have choices for native ones:D..if i really wanted to play that type of game
2014-12-12 04:55:06	xpander69	Strife, HoN, Dota 2
2014-12-12 04:55:19	Jesta	Strife is fun
2014-12-12 04:55:20	xpander69	with MMORPG's we dont have so..
2014-12-12 04:55:33	xpander69	i dont count Planeshift and Regnum:D
2014-12-12 04:56:59	xpander69	though i know what you mean... we have native music producing programs for linux also like Renoise, Bitwig Studios and LMMS and so on..but i still use FL Studio via wine
2014-12-12 04:57:05	xpander69	because its too hard to start learning new one:D
2014-12-12 04:57:34	stqn	Musagi! :P
2014-12-12 04:58:47	xpander69	iim also using JACK audio 24/7 on my system..playing games and stuff like that through that...the trick is with pulseaudio jack sink and jack source..so programs know where to connect :D
2014-12-12 04:59:00	stqn	uhh
2014-12-12 04:59:09	stqn	so you have alsa + jack + pulseaudio?
2014-12-12 04:59:14	xpander69	yea
2014-12-12 04:59:32	xpander69	still lower latency than alsa+pulse
2014-12-12 04:59:41	xpander69	in fact 6ms only
2014-12-12 04:59:44	stqn	games don’t work with just jack?
2014-12-12 05:00:11	xpander69	maybe with thinkering they can be put working..but its pain in the ass to configure
2014-12-12 05:00:18	stqn	too bad
2014-12-12 05:00:33	stqn	I wanted to try jack some day because alsa is a pain to configure… :P
2014-12-12 05:00:34	xpander69	so pulse is needed to take control of the situation for this stuff
2014-12-12 05:00:41	xpander69	makes life easier
2014-12-12 05:01:06	stqn	what about oss4, does anyone use that?
2014-12-12 05:01:27	xpander69	i have so bad memories of it that i dont want to touch it anymore
2014-12-12 05:01:31	xpander69	even it its improved now:D

2014-12-12 05:13:44	RavenholmDX	can't you edit an .ini or something?
2014-12-12 05:15:07	FutureSuture	Nope
2014-12-12 05:15:58	xpander69	you can

2014-12-12 05:16:05	xpander69	r_res_vert 1600
2014-12-12 05:16:29	@Samsai	there is a user.cfg file in the steam folder
2014-12-12 05:16:31	xpander69	user.cfg file located in metro folder and your user id
2014-12-12 05:16:54	xpander69	like ~/Steam/SteamApps/common/Metro 2033 Redux/110000102d99129/user.cfg
2014-12-12 05:17:01	@Samsai	no FOV settings though
2014-12-12 05:17:09	@Samsai	and the FPS counter no longer exists
2014-12-12 05:17:16	xpander69	FOV setting is there
2014-12-12 05:17:26	xpander69	r_base_fov 70.0
2014-12-12 05:17:35	xpander69	fps is also there
2014-12-12 05:17:37	xpander69	fps on
2014-12-12 05:17:52	xpander69	you are looking into wrong user.cfg i think
2014-12-12 05:18:06	FutureSuture	"I've tried modifying user.cfg and the changes are nullified when I start the game again. "
2014-12-12 05:18:14	@Samsai	well, let me try these out then...
2014-12-12 05:18:16	xpander69	mark read  only
2014-12-12 05:18:25	xpander69	and dont use the user.cfg in metro directory
2014-12-12 05:18:35	xpander69	go to the id directory...theres correct user.cfg
2014-12-12 05:19:03	xpander69	the metro dir user.cfg is fallback i think..to default settings
2014-12-12 05:19:44	xpander69	you can turn tess on and off from the cfg also
2014-12-12 05:20:35	@Samsai	fps counter still doesn't work
2014-12-12 05:20:43	Raven67854	I'd turn tessellation off
2014-12-12 05:23:19	xpander69	fps doesnt show yeah..with the option enabled or disabled
2014-12-12 05:23:23	xpander69	glxosd works though:D
2014-12-12 05:23:32	@Samsai	doesn't work for me
2014-12-12 05:23:35	xpander69	and res gets reset because quality options probably
2014-12-12 05:23:36	@Samsai	crashes every time
2014-12-12 05:24:08	RavenholmDX	So it's a non-issue xpander69 :P
2014-12-12 05:24:14	RavenholmDX	just UI control would be a nice to have
2014-12-12 05:25:00	xpander69	hmm ok crashes for me also with glxosd i think i accidentaly started metro LL where it works
2014-12-12 05:25:11	xpander69	so glxosd doesnt have opengl4 stuff to operate i guess?
2014-12-12 05:25:24	hidekin	i have a camera problem with metro 2033 redux , the camera turn around without doing anything. Maybe something to do with mouse acceleration ?
2014-12-12 05:25:26	@Samsai	i haven't heard of limitations like that
2014-12-12 05:25:55	xpander69	Samsai, yeah because unreal4 games are gl4 also? and there it works
2014-12-12 05:26:06	xpander69	hidekin, maybe you have gamepad attached?
2014-12-12 05:26:24	hidekin	i detached it to see but same problem
2014-12-12 05:26:36	xpander69	restart game after you detached
2014-12-12 05:26:43	Raven67854	xpander69, GL3 actually
2014-12-12 05:26:52	Raven67854	UE4 just has GL4 support but it's still a tad buggy on Linux
2014-12-12 05:26:55	Raven67854	so most run in GL3
2014-12-12 05:27:28	hidekin	already done ... iI'll also try to quit steam
2014-12-12 05:27:58	xpander69	but the strange thing is that redux doesnt look that good as LL does imo:D
2014-12-12 05:28:32	xpander69	but marking the config file read only works
2014-12-12 05:28:46	xpander69	you cant change video settings ingame anymore also then :D
2014-12-12 05:29:03	@Samsai	for me the game seems to mark the file read-write every time i launch it
2014-12-12 05:29:19	xpander69	uhm
2014-12-12 05:29:39	xpander69	i know now why i had bad perf... it was 2560x1600 reso somehow
2014-12-12 05:29:48	xpander69	forcing to 1920x1080 and it runs suprbly:D

2014-12-12 05:32:54	FutureSuture	So what is the verdict? Do these suggested changes work now...or not?
2014-12-12 05:33:20	@Samsai	hmm... i'm still not happy with the fact that the game changes my file permissions
2014-12-12 05:33:33	xpander69	if you look closer to that white thingy: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28788188/ss_12122014_15.31.57.png
2014-12-12 05:33:35	RavenholmDX	xpander69, what GPU do you have again?
2014-12-12 05:33:43	xpander69	theres some sort of shadow grid:D..or some fade in effect gone wrong
2014-12-12 05:34:17	xpander69	GTX 660TI only
2014-12-12 05:34:20	xpander69	its weak
2014-12-12 05:34:26	RavenholmDX	what settings you playing at?
2014-12-12 05:34:29	RavenholmDX	medium?
2014-12-12 05:34:43	xpander69	High
2014-12-12 05:34:45	RavenholmDX	660Ti is still decent
2014-12-12 05:34:59	xpander69	midrange
2014-12-12 05:35:01	xpander69	it is
2014-12-12 05:35:02	RavenholmDX	sure
2014-12-12 05:35:13	RavenholmDX	but you don't need much more than midrange
2014-12-12 05:35:19	xpander69	i do

2014-12-12 05:35:35	RavenholmDX	hopefully I can hit that
2014-12-12 05:35:43	Raven67854	wont be doing that with a 660Ti

2014-12-12 05:35:51	RavenholmDX	some areas really slow down
2014-12-12 05:35:53	xpander69	BL2 runs superbly on my machine
2014-12-12 05:35:57	xpander69	after GL_THREADDED
2014-12-12 05:36:01	RavenholmDX	I shall try that
2014-12-12 05:36:14	RavenholmDX	I get stutter in parts
2014-12-12 05:36:16	@Samsai	a lot of games run really well with GL_THREADED
2014-12-12 05:36:19	xpander69	someone want to buy my 660TI?:D
2014-12-12 05:36:22	@Samsai	like interstellar marines for example
2014-12-12 05:36:26	RavenholmDX	not necessarily frame drops
2014-12-12 05:36:35	xpander69	135€? it should still have warranty for 1 year:D
2014-12-12 05:36:36	@Samsai	runs like crap without, mostly solid 60 fps with
2014-12-12 05:36:53	xpander69	yeah interstellar gains shitlaods
2014-12-12 05:36:58	xpander69	well all unity4 games do
2014-12-12 05:36:58	Raven67854	xpander69, could probably buy a GTX750Ti cheaper than that :P
2014-12-12 05:37:08	@Samsai	hah! suck it metro!
2014-12-12 05:37:13	xpander69	750Ti is weaker also:D
2014-12-12 05:37:18	Raven67854	Not sure
2014-12-12 05:37:24	@Samsai	i changed the config file owner to root, what are you going to do about that!?
2014-12-12 05:37:34	xpander69	and you are talking about US prices Raven67854 :D
2014-12-12 05:37:49	xpander69	750Ti here is 160€ the cheapest
2014-12-12 05:38:19	RavenholmDX	I can get a 750Ti here for €108
2014-12-12 05:38:26	xpander69	:(
2014-12-12 05:38:31	RavenholmDX	Gigabyte 2GB
2014-12-12 05:38:37	stqn	Samsai: I don’t think the game cares about being able to write or not to the file… it must be forcing the resolution at load
2014-12-12 05:38:45	stqn	time
2014-12-12 05:38:53	@Samsai	stqn, yeah, and it sucks
2014-12-12 05:39:02	xpander69	ahh ok 139€ is cheapest here..with some nasty cooling
2014-12-12 05:39:13	@Samsai	i want my game to use my settings, i know better than the game
2014-12-12 05:39:37	RavenholmDX	Samsai, what specs you running on?
2014-12-12 05:39:38	xpander69	Samsai, i think the quality slider is the resolution
2014-12-12 05:39:48	xpander69	its running on higher resolution on higher settings and downscaling it
2014-12-12 05:40:02	@Samsai	RavenholmDX, gtx 760, intel i5 2500k, 8GB of RAM
2014-12-12 05:40:18	Raven67854	it seems to run at my res
2014-12-12 05:40:21	Raven67854	I think
2014-12-12 05:40:28	@Samsai	check the config file
2014-12-12 05:40:36	Raven67854	I don't have any jagged edges
2014-12-12 05:40:41	Raven67854	So I'll assume I do
2014-12-12 05:40:48	RavenholmDX	I find it funny that they feel the need to nerf settings in the linux version, even though linux users are the most comfortable with tweaking stuff
2014-12-12 05:40:53	xpander69	it runs your res but it downscales from higher res
2014-12-12 05:40:58	RavenholmDX	maybe they expect people to go into the config files
2014-12-12 05:40:58	xpander69	well depends what monitor you have ofc:D
2014-12-12 05:40:59	Raven67854	Windows options menu is also annoying
2014-12-12 05:41:16	@Samsai	at least the game now has to use my resolution settings
2014-12-12 05:41:21	xpander69	for 1920x1080 when you set to High quality it changes 2560x1600 and downscales it
2014-12-12 05:41:24	@Samsai	because it can't change the file anymore
2014-12-12 05:41:25	Raven67854	Metro games have always had stupid options menu
2014-12-12 05:42:01	Raven67854	Sure it's not SSA set to 2x that does that
2014-12-12 05:42:37	Raven67854	I turned tesselation off
2014-12-12 05:42:43	hidekin	ok the camera is working now , i had to remove the gamepad dongle ... even if the gamepad is off
2014-12-12 05:42:44	Raven67854	Not worth being on
2014-12-12 05:43:10	xpander69	SSA A is off for me..it caused huge drops... well 0.5x was fine though
2014-12-12 05:43:16	xpander69	2x was epic slowdown
2014-12-12 05:43:28	xpander69	motion blur is off cause i hate it
2014-12-12 05:43:33	Raven67854	I assume SSAA stands for SuperSampling Anti-Aliasing
2014-12-12 05:43:40	xpander69	yeah it scales resolution
2014-12-12 05:43:47	Raven67854	It's for AA
2014-12-12 05:44:07	Raven67854	0.5 would be half res =/
2014-12-12 05:44:51	xpander69	ahh i dont know..i dont really care much...works mostly fine anyway... but i need new GPU :D
2014-12-12 05:44:55	xpander69	who gives me money?:D
2014-12-12 05:45:25	hidekin	i have a gtx 770 it's really smooth on it :-)
2014-12-12 05:45:32	RavenholmDX	960 is out soon
2014-12-12 05:45:46	xpander69	dont want...this time i wont do same mistake:D
2014-12-12 05:45:56	xpander69	dont buy midrange card anymore
2014-12-12 05:45:57	RavenholmDX	I'll never buy high end again
2014-12-12 05:46:06	xpander69	you have to upgrade too often :D

2014-12-12 05:46:39	xpander69	now 660Ti is also 1 year a bit more...and i need upgrade already
2014-12-12 05:46:47	RavenholmDX	the *70 is the sweet spot IMO
2014-12-12 05:46:52	xpander69	if i'd went for 670 i would be still 1 year fine:D
2014-12-12 05:46:52	RavenholmDX	wouldn't really consider it high end
2014-12-12 05:47:12	xpander69	i consider *70 high end
2014-12-12 05:47:16	xpander69	80 extreme:D
2014-12-12 05:47:25	RavenholmDX	I'd say *80 is high end
2014-12-12 05:47:30	RavenholmDX	and *90/Titan is extreme
2014-12-12 05:47:46	xpander69	maybe:D
2014-12-12 05:47:50	xpander69	anyway '60 is too weak:D
2014-12-12 05:47:53	hidekin	titan z is extreme extreme lol
2014-12-12 05:48:02	RavenholmDX	AKA pointless :P
2014-12-12 05:48:03	Raven67854	Yeah but it's wonderful
2014-12-12 05:48:29	RavenholmDX	I had SLI GTX 580s
2014-12-12 05:48:31	Raven67854	GTX980 is faster than a titan-z on Linux. Unless you happen to be running something that's CUDA/OpenCL
2014-12-12 05:48:38	RavenholmDX	never again
2014-12-12 05:48:57	RavenholmDX	I know in Windows, my GTX 970 beats out the GTX 980
2014-12-12 05:49:00	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, I like mine.. Renders stuff really fast and it's fun to play around with physics
2014-12-12 05:49:01	RavenholmDX	OC'd of course
2014-12-12 05:49:14	RavenholmDX	sure Raven67854, if you can afford it, why not
2014-12-12 05:49:22	RavenholmDX	I'd get it myself if I could afford it :P
2014-12-12 05:49:28	Raven67854	Eh at this point get a 980
2014-12-12 05:49:35	Raven67854	or whatever's coming early next year
2014-12-12 05:49:45	RavenholmDX	I was considering a second 970 for a while
2014-12-12 05:49:52	xpander69	my biggest mistake with GPU's was when i bought 5770 ..it wasnt even midrange and it was nasty ATI  with driver problems

2014-12-12 05:50:48	RavenholmDX	8800GTX was a killer card
2014-12-12 05:50:49	Raven67854	Card ran hot though

2014-12-12 05:51:02	xpander69	mine went to oven 2 times:D
2014-12-12 05:51:05	xpander69	worked fine after:D
2014-12-12 05:51:08	RavenholmDX	8800 Ultra was the "Ti" version wasn't it?
2014-12-12 05:51:16	Raven67854	Sure
2014-12-12 05:51:19	hidekin	i still have it , but not using it anymore

2014-12-12 05:51:53	Raven67854	idled at 65c late in it's life and ran at 105c when playing a game
2014-12-12 05:52:09	RavenholmDX	sounds like my old 290x
2014-12-12 05:52:11	Raven67854	No real point to that though RavenholmDX

2014-12-12 05:52:50	Morgawr	and cut off all the shitty background noise from my fan (all my friends were complaining over teamspeak about it)

2014-12-12 05:53:08	xpander69	and then it died...then 200°C 10 min in furnace and then it worked 1 year for more..then once again it died and one more time into Furnace and worked more..then i sold it..so i dont know how it was then:D

2014-12-12 05:53:33	Raven67854	But I may pick up a GTX980 in the spring when the prices drops a bit more to replace my TitanZ
2014-12-12 05:53:37	RavenholmDX	Well if we start getting UT4 games next year
2014-12-12 05:53:38	Morgawr	(please kill me)
2014-12-12 05:53:42	RavenholmDX	and I upgrade to a 4K monitor
2014-12-12 05:53:50	RavenholmDX	will need to get something a bit beefier
2014-12-12 05:53:54	Raven67854	Why?
2014-12-12 05:54:00	Raven67854	I play games at 4k with my titan
2014-12-12 05:54:03	Raven67854	It's fine
2014-12-12 05:54:21	RavenholmDX	at highest settings? :P
2014-12-12 05:54:23	RavenholmDX	60FPS?
2014-12-12 05:54:24	Raven67854	Yes
2014-12-12 05:54:42	xpander69	Raven67854, except many games under linux dont support 4k resolutions
2014-12-12 05:54:44	xpander69	many unity games
2014-12-12 05:54:50	Raven67854	xpander69, I don't play Unity games
2014-12-12 05:55:03	Raven67854	The few that I do I play in Windowed
2014-12-12 05:55:08	RavenholmDX	Raven67854, have you tried something like Dolphin?
2014-12-12 05:55:10	RavenholmDX	or PCSX2?
2014-12-12 05:55:18	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, CPU bound and it works fine
2014-12-12 05:55:27	RavenholmDX	nice
2014-12-12 05:55:32	hidekin	currently i have 2 24" ips screens i'm thinking about getting a gaming screen in 144hz or a screen in 2560x1600 , difficult to choose. I don't know if i could get used to TN screens again i'm used to IPS
2014-12-12 05:55:35	Raven67854	I7-5960x emulates things nicely

2014-12-12 05:55:48	Raven67854	hidekin, I wouldn't bother with a 2560x1600 screen. I'd just go 4k
2014-12-12 05:55:58	Raven67854	25600x1600 screens are same or more than a 4k screen

2014-12-12 05:56:09	Raven67854	2560*
2014-12-12 05:56:17	RavenholmDX	get a 120FPS 2560x1440 screen
2014-12-12 05:56:43	Raven67854	I'd still rather have a 4k screen than a 120hz screen :p
2014-12-12 05:56:46	Raven67854	All that space is hard to go back from
2014-12-12 05:57:05	xpander69	just use multiple monitors:D
2014-12-12 05:57:19	Raven67854	Eh I don't really like odd resolution monitors
2014-12-12 05:57:20	hidekin	currently i have 2 1920x1200 24" screens
2014-12-12 05:57:42	RavenholmDX	I don't have the space for multiple monitors
2014-12-12 05:57:46	xpander69	i have 3 1920x1080..and im fine with that:D
2014-12-12 05:57:52	RavenholmDX	live in a small apartment

2014-12-12 05:58:00	RavenholmDX	with a small desk :P
2014-12-12 05:58:10	Raven67854	I'd go 4k then :p
2014-12-12 05:58:13	Raven67854	1 28" 4k
2014-12-12 05:58:15	Raven67854	mmm tasty
2014-12-12 05:58:18	RavenholmDX	Was thinking 21:9

2014-12-12 05:58:26	Raven67854	Fuck ultrawide
2014-12-12 05:58:39	Raven67854	vertical space is also important
2014-12-12 05:58:44	hidekin	4k seems nice but i'm waiting for an IPS one :-)
2014-12-12 05:58:49	Raven67854	hidekin, already make IPS ones
2014-12-12 05:58:56	Raven67854	about ~$700
2014-12-12 05:59:06	hidekin	nice :-)
2014-12-12 05:59:27	Raven67854	I hate ultrawide screens.. I don't know why people don't want vertical space too =/
2014-12-12 05:59:52	xpander69	because you have 2 eyes which see better to the sides
2014-12-12 05:59:52	hidekin	i really like 16:10
2014-12-12 06:00:00	RavenholmDX	well at 3840x1440, you still have the vertical space of a 2560x1440 resolution
2014-12-12 06:00:45	hidekin	better for coding and photography works
2014-12-12 06:01:23	Sik	16:10: you get the missing horizontal space you wish you had, but without sacrificing vertical space
2014-12-12 06:01:28	Sik	Well, when it's implemented properly
2014-12-12 06:01:38	Sik	Generally it's just a chopped 4:3 resolution instead >:(
2014-12-12 06:01:51	Sik	(and all widescreen resolutions follow that pattern)

2014-12-12 06:41:34	linux_gamer	lol

2014-12-12 06:42:00	RavenholmDX	or including libraries in the binary

2014-12-12 06:42:40	xpander69	if the perf is fine then i dont care if its wrapper or not
2014-12-12 06:42:40	linux_gamer	maybe some additional libraries in it sounds legit
2014-12-12 06:42:47	NuSuey	xpander69: +1
2014-12-12 06:42:53	hidekin	but usually it's not the case ...
2014-12-12 06:43:01	xpander69	like?
2014-12-12 06:43:09	hidekin	the performance with witcher 2 is not that good
2014-12-12 06:43:17	xpander69	didnt have problems with it
2014-12-12 06:43:26	xpander69	and over time it got even better
2014-12-12 06:43:26	hidekin	the fps are ok but i've a lot of stuttering
2014-12-12 06:43:32	linux_gamer	yes that hindered me from buying it dont have titan
2014-12-12 06:43:32	xpander69	no such issue here
2014-12-12 06:43:53	xpander69	i dont have titan also:D
2014-12-12 06:43:55	EXetoC	meep meep
2014-12-12 06:44:11	linux_gamer	there is no need for a game to be slower on linux if its OGL
2014-12-12 06:44:53	xpander69	well for example some unity3d games run better in wine than "native" ones
2014-12-12 06:44:55	stqn	to be fair as long as there is no "proper" port we can’t know if it’s any slower with eON
2014-12-12 06:44:56	linux_gamer	yes but if its 10% of its frames its unplayable for 99%
2014-12-12 06:45:07	hidekin	in witcher 2 i've between 50-70fps and for windows it's between 90 and 110 fps but the stuttering are a lot worse
2014-12-12 06:45:19	linux_gamer	almost 50%
2014-12-12 06:45:25	stqn	and also as JC was saying, Valve and others (don’t remember) are also using a DX->GL translation layer
2014-12-12 06:45:30	xpander69	i dont have windows to compare but i have 50-80 fps also in witcher
2014-12-12 06:45:36	xpander69	and no stuttering
2014-12-12 06:45:58	NuSuey	lol 	gloriouslinuxmasterrace.com	Available .. hmhmhmhm :D

2014-12-12 06:46:15	linux_gamer	be quick
2014-12-12 06:46:33	xpander69	hidekin, now also run some source game on windows vs linux..like dota 2 and see that you have same fps difference with win and linux :D

2014-12-12 06:55:19	NuSuey	I look forward to the new engine for dota2 :o
2014-12-12 06:55:28	@Samsai	in one area
2014-12-12 06:55:38	RavenholmDX	are they making an actual cross platform engine?
2014-12-12 06:55:40	@Samsai	ubuntu killed windows in the other :P
2014-12-12 06:55:44	liamdawe	cheapest keyboard on play.com is a MS keyboard, sure why not
2014-12-12 06:55:50	Raven67854	RavenholmDX, yep
2014-12-12 06:56:06	xpander69	Samsai, yeah nice to see thatone..i have seen it back in days though... but most games still run better under windows
2014-12-12 06:56:08	RavenholmDX	liamdawe, they have a £10 off £40 voucher at the moment
2014-12-12 06:56:19	xpander69	but its ofc the problem that linux version is not tested enough etc
2014-12-12 06:56:25	liamdawe	RavenholmDX: i wont be spending that much :P
2014-12-12 06:56:41	hidekin	also drivers can still become better on linux
2014-12-12 06:56:47	xpander69	yeah ofc
2014-12-12 06:57:06	xpander69	but there are some games that run better under linux
2014-12-12 06:57:38	xpander69	for example Metro LL ..when i tweak the settings same on Windows it runs still worse...tested with friend at lan party..with pretty much same hardware
2014-12-12 06:57:45	xpander69	different ram and motherboard only

2014-12-12 06:59:25	hidekin	what linux is still lacking for games are mods , so much to do with them on windows
2014-12-12 06:59:27	RavenholmDX	like 200-300% better
2014-12-12 07:00:01	hidekin	and graphic enhancement mods like enb or sweetfx but they're directx only

2014-12-12 07:03:19	RavenholmDX	like seriously
2014-12-12 07:03:30	RavenholmDX	games have been increasingly moving towards 64bit only
2014-12-12 07:03:34	RavenholmDX	which is a good thing
2014-12-12 07:03:37	Dezponia	"Watch out my dad works at Nintendo" is the gamer counterpart
2014-12-12 07:03:43	Dezponia	Or "My dad works at Valve" for modern times

2014-12-12 07:06:05	RavenholmDX	I still feel 4GB is somewhat sufficient for Linux
2014-12-12 07:06:10	RavenholmDX	but RAM is cheap
2014-12-12 07:06:20	Dezponia	I did like the "what year is this" image with Terminator, Jurasic Park, Star Wars movies comming out :P
2014-12-12 07:06:23	NuSuey	well 40euros for another 4gb
2014-12-12 07:06:23	tadzik	there's no reason to not have tons of it :)
2014-12-12 07:06:34	tadzik	NuSuey: sounds expensive
2014-12-12 07:06:39	tadzik	or maybe not
2014-12-12 07:06:39	RavenholmDX	NuSuey, I think I paid €80 for 16GB
2014-12-12 07:06:40	xpander69	i dont..but thats me who has 60+ tabs open in browser all the time
2014-12-12 07:06:46	xpander69	4GB would run out super fast
2014-12-12 07:06:50	xpander69	and i dont like swap
2014-12-12 07:06:51	tadzik	let me tell you about bookmarks
2014-12-12 07:06:53	RavenholmDX	I like not having to have a swap

2014-12-12 07:07:05	xpander69	i like insta access
2014-12-12 07:07:06	tadzik	I don't have swap since I got 2GB of ram
2014-12-12 07:07:12	Dezponia	I run 16GB of RAM in my gaming rig, my main laptop, my secondary laptop has 8GB. My KVM server has 32GB (and this is actually not enough, RAM is the most critical part of a hypervisor box)
2014-12-12 07:07:51	NuSuey	well I'll be thinking then about getting more ram then >.< hopefully there will be some good deals during year's end
2014-12-12 07:07:58	tadzik	well, I used to create a swapfile to hibernate a laptop to
2014-12-12 07:08:20	Morgawr	I have run out of 8GB of ram when having 2 drawing programs, 1 editor, two browsers, OBS + jack sound plugins for microphone all running at the same time
2014-12-12 07:08:22	xpander69	i have 16GB and its pretty normal that 10GB is taken when im not even gaming:D
2014-12-12 07:08:28	xpander69	but ofc most is cached also
2014-12-12 07:08:28	tadzik	"taken" :)
2014-12-12 07:08:29	Morgawr	(drawing programs were Mypaint + krita)
2014-12-12 07:08:37	Dezponia	I think 8GB is probably sufficent for most games right now and 16GB if you want to future proof
2014-12-12 07:08:38	Morgawr	also an HTTP server
2014-12-12 07:08:47	RavenholmDX	I typically see 10% usage on my machine
2014-12-12 07:08:56	RavenholmDX	3% on a cold boot
2014-12-12 07:08:57	tadzik	I only upgraded from 2GB to be able to compile vcmi
2014-12-12 07:08:59	RavenholmDX	with 16GB
2014-12-12 07:09:05	tadzik	or rakudo perl 6 without having to close the browser :P

2014-12-12 07:10:06	RavenholmDX	If I had 32GB
2014-12-12 07:10:15	RavenholmDX	I'd probably run root from a ram disk :P
2014-12-12 07:10:48	tadzik	that's an awesome idea
2014-12-12 07:10:49	NuSuey	I bought my 240 GB ssd ..and the guys who recommended  were like .. NO the prices won't go down.. after just a few months..boom :/ meh, much cheaper now .. but guess that happens in tech :)
2014-12-12 07:11:01	tadzik	they're still expensive as fuck :P
2014-12-12 07:11:03	hidekin	sorry 32GB :-) i should try to do that
2014-12-12 07:11:06	Morgawr	"the price won't go down"
2014-12-12 07:11:10	Morgawr	who says that lol

2014-12-12 07:23:08	Morgawr	linux_gamer: it's true, we had a talk at our university last year with a google engineer telling us the scale of things

2014-12-12 07:23:14	Morgawr	and those were some numbers he gave us, I think
2014-12-12 07:23:17	xpander69	i upload with like 1-2 minutes and then it takes forever

2014-12-12 07:28:30	Morgawr	lol
2014-12-12 07:28:34	Morgawr	been here since august
2014-12-12 07:28:42	RavenholmDX	I just passed three years
2014-12-12 07:28:46	RavenholmDX	where are you from orginally?
2014-12-12 07:28:51	RavenholmDX	originally*
2014-12-12 07:29:06	Morgawr	I don't frequent the parts of the city next to my apartment though, cause whenever I go out it's with my colleagues that are all close to the office (in grand canal)
2014-12-12 07:29:13	Morgawr	I'm from Italy but I've been studying in Amsterdam
2014-12-12 07:29:19	RavenholmDX	OH

2014-12-12 07:31:17	Morgawr	which is idiotic cause a) I might not have a phone at all and b)I don't need to have a phone from the same country to live in such country
2014-12-12 07:31:25	Morgawr	so I ended up giving my address as "Dublin, Netherlands"
2014-12-12 07:31:25	Morgawr	:^)

2014-12-12 07:31:51	Morgawr	idk, it kept complaining about the length or something
2014-12-12 07:31:58	Morgawr	so I just changed the country (didn't think it'd work)
2014-12-12 07:32:00	Morgawr	the famous Dutch Dublin
2014-12-12 07:32:50	RavenholmDX	haha
2014-12-12 07:32:56	RavenholmDX	How do you like Dublin?
2014-12-12 07:33:09	liamdawe	amazon it is then...
2014-12-12 07:33:56	Morgawr	RavenholmDX: Dublin itself isn't too bad, around the city it's really nice, been to Howth, Dun'Laoghaire and Bray and they are lovely
2014-12-12 07:34:06	Morgawr	my apartment is a piece of shit though, but I have to survive :P
2014-12-12 07:34:09	RavenholmDX	alot of junkies though :P
2014-12-12 07:34:21	RavenholmDX	Well, we live in the 'bad part of the city'
2014-12-12 07:34:23	Morgawr	I prefer Amsterdam all in all, as far as services and cleanliness go, I have to be honest
2014-12-12 07:34:30	Morgawr	yeah, true
2014-12-12 07:34:42	RavenholmDX	as soon as you go south of the river
2014-12-12 07:34:47	RavenholmDX	everything is posh and fancy :P
2014-12-12 07:34:53	Morgawr	I was pleasantly surprised by the widespread availability of public wifi spots (also on buses) overall, that was really nice
2014-12-12 07:35:07	Morgawr	we don't have that in Amsterdam (or Italy)
2014-12-12 07:35:08	RavenholmDX	Yeah, Ireland is getting pretty good with internet
2014-12-12 07:35:14	RavenholmDX	I'm rocking 200Mb at home now
2014-12-12 07:35:24	RavenholmDX	vs the 7Mb max you can get in Clare :P
2014-12-12 07:35:38	Morgawr	I have a pretty average ISP in my apartment, unfortunately wifi only cause it's shared by everyone in the building but it works
2014-12-12 07:35:43	Morgawr	I miss my 100/100 in NL though
2014-12-12 07:36:08	Morgawr	I think I have 50/10 here
2014-12-12 07:36:39	RavenholmDX	not bad
2014-12-12 07:36:40	RavenholmDX	UPC?
2014-12-12 07:36:54	Morgawr	no idea, it's all managed by my landlord
2014-12-12 07:36:59	Morgawr	I just connected to it \o/
2014-12-12 07:37:29	Morgawr	although hilariously the router has no password so I could log into it to open a port once to play Risk of Rain with a friend over the net
2014-12-12 07:37:38	Morgawr	but I closed it right after cause the landlord would kill me if he found out
2014-12-12 07:37:57	tadzik	why would he?:)
2014-12-12 07:38:05	RavenholmDX	I doubt he's even technically competent if it's open
2014-12-12 07:38:13	Morgawr	RavenholmDX: yeah
2014-12-12 07:38:13	tadzik	if the router has no password, he'd have zero idea what that means and why it happened
2014-12-12 07:38:23	Morgawr	tadzik: well, that goes into the "he will never find out"
2014-12-12 07:38:31	Morgawr	but if he does, he wouldn't be happy
2014-12-12 07:38:36	RavenholmDX	Morgawr, put a password on it
2014-12-12 07:38:39	Morgawr	lol
2014-12-12 07:38:43	RavenholmDX	enjoy 100% of the bandwidth
2014-12-12 07:38:51	Morgawr	I thought about it, mostly cause I was getting pissed at some connection problems a few months ago
2014-12-12 07:38:56	tadzik	change essid to "YellPenisForPassword"
2014-12-12 07:39:01	tadzik	enjoy the hilarity of the situation
2014-12-12 07:39:23	Morgawr	RavenholmDX: how are you enjoying the water protests?
2014-12-12 07:42:32	RavenholmDX	I haven't been :P
2014-12-12 07:42:48	RavenholmDX	haven't really cared
2014-12-12 07:42:59	RavenholmDX	I have a job and can afford taxes if they assure me good quality water
2014-12-12 07:43:57	Morgawr	I was mostly talking about inconveniences due to the protests
2014-12-12 07:44:08	Morgawr	the other day I had to walk 50 minutes from the office back home because all the buses were blocked
2014-12-12 07:44:22	Morgawr	either tuesday or wednesday, I don't remember
2014-12-12 07:44:27	stqn	I wonder why publishers typically release their games at a big discount. I’ve read somewhere that it’s a great way to lose money because people who want to buy the game at day one would probably buy it at full price anyway.
2014-12-12 07:44:57	stqn	The Witcher 2, Dead Island, Metro Redux, all released at a big discount.
2014-12-12 07:45:04	<--	tropiko (~tropiko@109.103.168.31) has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2014-12-12 07:45:05	Morgawr	stqn: yeah, the logic probably is that the game at discount is counted as the "real" price and they just sell it a big higher on release so suckers get to pay more :P
2014-12-12 07:45:20	stqn	eh
2014-12-12 07:45:27	Morgawr	they could just lower all game prices, now that there's far less retail price overhead due to digital distribution (and steam is, in-fact, doing exactly this)
2014-12-12 07:47:29	stqn	I don’t really mind though as I don’t like TW, already finished Dead Island and Metro 2033 on Xbox 360…

2014-12-12 07:50:21	stqn	Only problem: not enough disk space to install them.
2014-12-12 07:50:45	tadzik	if they lowered all prices they couldn't bait people with discounts
2014-12-12 07:51:20	Morgawr	tadzik: exactly
2014-12-12 07:51:28	tadzik	it makes a lot of sense; overprice games, some people will still buy them, good for you, then you can safely put on a -50% for everyone else
2014-12-12 07:51:46	Morgawr	I was super interested in metro redux but I alreayd played 2033 on windows back in the day and I have Metro TLL (didn't finish it yet) already
2014-12-12 07:51:55	Morgawr	plus apparently they dropped support for intel cards so out of my league
2014-12-12 07:52:04	mirv_	do we know how well Metro plays yet?
2014-12-12 07:52:11	tadzik	there are reports on reddit
2014-12-12 07:52:23	Morgawr	Metro TLL plays wonderfully so I'd say it'll play fairly well too in the remakes?
2014-12-12 07:52:31	Morgawr	(as long as you don't have intel card like me)
2014-12-12 07:52:44	stqn	some people report crashes, others that everything’s fine
2014-12-12 07:52:48	mirv_	hmm
2014-12-12 07:53:06	mirv_	maybe I'll buy it if I complete borderlands 2 this weekend
2014-12-12 07:53:11	stqn	(except for the no resolution selection and no tesselation option and only very slow FSAA)
2014-12-12 07:53:21	mirv_	wait, what, no resolution selection?
2014-12-12 07:53:35	stqn	yes, like the original last light…
2014-12-12 07:53:40	Morgawr	mirv_: you playing borderlands 2 too? I'm still at the beginning (just found Lilith)
2014-12-12 07:53:54	mirv_	Morgawr, just wrapping up the DLCs
2014-12-12 07:54:02	stqn	I can’t be bothered to finish BL2… I had fun for a while but not anymore.
2014-12-12 07:54:10	mirv_	damn BL2 is a grind of a game
2014-12-12 07:54:32	Morgawr	I was having a lot of fun playing alone (I love grinding, sue me, although I'm not a fan of doing that in FPS and there are a few "aggro" bugs in BL2)
2014-12-12 07:54:46	Morgawr	but now other irl stuff and projects have come up so I haven't gotten the chance to continue
2014-12-12 07:55:09	Morgawr	I started working on a visual novel engine to rival ren'py :D
2014-12-12 07:55:13	mirv_	Morgawr, the game length is inflated because of having to retrace your steps so often
2014-12-12 07:55:14	Morgawr	it's been fun
2014-12-12 07:55:21	Morgawr	mirv_: yeah that stuff is annoying
2014-12-12 07:56:03	stqn	I find programming to be more fun than gaming… when I have the motivation and energy for it.
2014-12-12 07:56:41	mirv_	my head can't focus on programming right now
2014-12-12 07:56:59	mirv_	can't wait to be off these tablets
2014-12-12 07:57:41	Morgawr	stqn: same, it definitely has its benefits... but sometimes I just get back home after work, sit in front of the PC staring at the screen for a couple of hours thinking "I want to work on X!" or "I want to play Y" but in the end I just realize it's too late and I need to get to bed :(

2014-12-12 08:52:30	Dezponia	What are we talking about?
2014-12-12 08:52:36	RavenholmDX	Jolla/SailfishOS
2014-12-12 08:52:48	Dezponia	Not a fan because the GUI is propritary
2014-12-12 08:53:00	Dezponia	If they release that under a free license then I'll be all for it
2014-12-12 08:53:00	RavenholmDX	Dezponia, for now
2014-12-12 08:53:08	RavenholmDX	they're opening more and more

2014-12-12 08:53:32	Dezponia	I wont buy into a promis of freedom
2014-12-12 08:53:33	RavenholmDX	Dezponia, I think when they get 'stable' they will
2014-12-12 08:54:01	RavenholmDX	Dezponia, what other alternative is there?
2014-12-12 08:54:09	Dezponia	Replicant
2014-12-12 08:54:13	Dezponia	Firefox OS
2014-12-12 08:55:04	Dezponia	Though Firefox OS is a weird one since they dont require apps to show their license in the store. Just because the HTML5 code they're made of is open does not mean its opensource or free software so I'd be careful there
2014-12-12 08:56:08	Dezponia	Hell even Cyanogenmod is more free than Jolla. Both have locked down firmwares and drivers because of the hardware (even Replicant is limited by that) but at least Cyanogenmods GUI and android runtime is free software
2014-12-12 08:57:31	RavenholmDX	still a great OS

2014-12-12 11:10:34	Yamagata	stqn AA is controlled by the generic quality setting, and it's only FXAA (the super fast, inaccurate shader-based type)
2014-12-12 11:10:56	Yamagata	the AA metro has as a separate option is super sample AA, which renders the game at a higher resolution and then downsamples to your native
2014-12-12 11:11:27	Morgawr	no santa for gaben this year
2014-12-12 11:11:41	Yamagata	(assuming you're at 1080p native) so 0.5x is 1080p scaled down to 720p, 2x is rendering the game at double 1080p and scaling down. 4x renders the game at 4k and scales down to 1080p, which is why SSAA is a MASSIVE performance hit

2014-12-12 11:13:25	stqn	too demanding
2014-12-12 11:13:58	Yamagata	stqn i run it at 0.5x which has nearly zero performance hit, but makes a nice looking 720p image. it's a setting meant for people with SLI systems that can push massive frame-buffers
2014-12-12 11:15:10	Yamagata	the game without it has more jaggies than some other games because of the way i suspect they're compositing their final frame. it prevents sampling of some edges because they're in separate buffers or objects and it doesn't appear to do any sampling through alpha. the SSAA setting is applied to the final frame unlike other AA types, so it gets not just jaggies but other artifacts

2014-12-12 11:17:42	Yamagata	it seems like it gets performance *very* comprable to windows though. the specs for windows are lower for min, but it also runs terribly below recommended spec even on low apparently
2014-12-12 11:17:58	Yamagata	seems like the linux min are not the actual min, but they'll get you decent, playable performance

2014-12-12 12:15:17	mETz	I just disconnected my gamepad since the game constantly switched labels for actions
2014-12-12 12:15:37	mETz	it could not decide if it wanted to show gamepad labels or keyboard labels :)

2014-12-12 13:33:19	flesk_	A game that released on Steam today is already giving out coupons for 80% off.
2014-12-12 13:33:33	flesk_	That seems rather strange.
2014-12-12 13:34:05	flesk_	Looks like a good game too. I put it on my wishlist earlier today.

2014-12-12 15:26:22	gnarface	to the linux client you mean? yea that annoyed me too
2014-12-12 15:26:28	stqn	yes of course :)
2014-12-12 15:26:29	gnarface	i mean
2014-12-12 15:26:40	gnarface	it would be nice if they at least moved the linux releases to the top of the queue
2014-12-12 15:27:00	gnarface	they don't have to stop promoting the windows ones altogether to me, necessarily
2014-12-12 15:27:16	gnarface	but its a given that i don't want to have to dig through them
2014-12-12 15:27:19	stqn	well I don’t use windows, so… it’s just a nuisance
2014-12-12 15:27:44	gnarface	i don't either, but before there was a linux steam i was known to buy a game or two that works in wine
2014-12-12 15:28:53	RavenholmDX	Did they raise the price of the Metro bundle?
2014-12-12 15:29:08	gnarface	now that there is a linux and mac steam, it does seem that at the very least they could push games your client/platform can't play down to the bottom of the promotion list
2014-12-12 15:29:51	gnarface	yes, RavenholmDX, it was i think $16.99 yesterday.  ow.  I should have bought it
2014-12-12 15:29:58	RavenholmDX	whew
2014-12-12 15:30:02	RavenholmDX	thankfully I grabbed it
2014-12-12 15:30:06	RavenholmDX	€13 yesterday
2014-12-12 15:30:08	RavenholmDX	€20 today
2014-12-12 15:30:17	gnarface	i'm seeing $24.98
2014-12-12 15:30:39	gnarface	apparently "weekend deal" isn't as good as a random thursday deal
2014-12-12 15:30:57	gnarface	(actually most likely a ton of people bought it and so they decided to raise the price, would be my guess)
2014-12-12 15:32:12	stqn	well it’s still a good price, even if you got last light already
2014-12-12 15:32:23	stqn	but surprising, yes
2014-12-12 15:33:34	gnarface	i never played either but the trailer certainly made ~17$ look like a great value
2014-12-12 15:33:55	gnarface	how is it for co-op multiplayer? i didn't research much, i just watched the trailer
2014-12-12 15:35:06	stqn	no idea, I don’t even know if it has multiplayer
2014-12-12 15:39:43	@liamdawe	okay

2014-12-12 15:41:39	gnarface	"Lagre" means "save" right?
2014-12-12 15:43:24	tadzik	oh wtf :(

2014-12-12 16:23:10	gnarface	(or whatever ubuntu calls them)
2014-12-12 16:23:19	gnarface	probably 2 or 3 other libs too
2014-12-12 16:23:24	gnarface	it'd be the same setup you'd need to run wine

2014-12-12 16:30:26	gnarface	if it only outputs amd64 you'll have to enable i386 first to even see them in the repo

2014-12-12 16:32:49	gnarface	the names of stuff is often different, as well as versions and patch levels, but more or less yes
2014-12-12 16:33:06	linux_gamer	you have the game and it runs?
2014-12-12 16:34:17	gnarface	uh, no not this one yet, i admit i'm merely speculating that the developers made a mistake and included some 32-bit libraries in what should have been a 64-bit only version of their release, because if you have a properly setup multiarch system that's an easy mistake to make
2014-12-12 16:34:33	gnarface	what you should do is send them a bug report
2014-12-12 16:35:02	gnarface	what i was giving you was "one last thing" you could try to potentially work around the apparent bug
2014-12-12 16:35:17	linux_gamer	yes thanks
2014-12-12 16:35:29	gnarface	good luck
2014-12-12 16:37:59	gnarface	linux_gamer: if you find out what the problem is i'd like to know
2014-12-12 16:38:08	gnarface	i'm very curious now
2014-12-12 16:38:25	linux_gamer	yes np
2014-12-12 16:38:56	linux_gamer	90% is understanding the error message

2014-12-12 16:43:57	gnarface	yes, that is what i think too, but enabling multiarch on your system could serve as a temporary fix
2014-12-12 16:44:29	gnarface	someone should probably report the issue though
2014-12-12 16:44:38	linux_gamer	that wont fix it or, if i have two libraries with same name it wont find the fitting
2014-12-12 16:44:47	gnarface	yea it will
2014-12-12 16:44:54	linux_gamer	have to set the path somehoe
2014-12-12 16:45:01	gnarface	i don't think so...
2014-12-12 16:45:05	linux_gamer	ill try
2014-12-12 16:45:29	linux_gamer	how was the command of checking the bit of lib?
2014-12-12 16:45:45	linux_gamer	is it possiblewith ldd?
2014-12-12 16:45:50	gnarface	not sure
2014-12-12 16:45:59	gnarface	dpkg --print-foreign-architectures
2014-12-12 16:46:04	gnarface	what does that output?
2014-12-12 16:46:47	linux_gamer	i386
2014-12-12 16:46:51	gnarface	ok that's good
2014-12-12 16:46:54	linux_gamer	should be right
2014-12-12 16:47:04	gnarface	yes
2014-12-12 16:47:15	linux_gamer	maybe an LD_PRELOAD=... fix
2014-12-12 16:47:36	linux_gamer	or i hardlink it but break all other games maybe
2014-12-12 16:47:50	gnarface	this might help? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultiArch

2014-12-12 16:48:42	gnarface	i can tell you the exact commands for debian, but the package names in ubuntu are different
2014-12-12 16:49:07	stqn	the game is 64 bit only, why would it require 32 bit libs?
2014-12-12 16:49:21	gnarface	stqn: i'm hypothesizing the developers made a mistake packaging it
2014-12-12 16:49:26	linux_gamer	yes thats the problem some wrong link i assume
2014-12-12 16:49:44	gnarface	stqn: if their dev environment is multiarch, they could have accidentally mixed some 32-bit libs in with the 64-bit libs and not noticed
2014-12-12 16:49:49	linux_gamer	or i did the hardlink prior cause of reverse error
2014-12-12 16:50:09	gnarface	stqn: furthermore, anyone testing it on a fully multiarch system would not have noticed either
2014-12-12 16:50:10	linux_gamer	./metro looks good all 64

2014-12-12 16:56:19	gnarface	no, with multiarch you should safely be able to have 32-bit and 64-bit libs installed together
2014-12-12 16:56:28	gnarface	i'm actually kindof surprised you have made much use of wine without it

2014-12-20 06:50:07	azizLIGHT	I didnt complete bl2 with sequels yet

2014-12-20 06:50:39	tadzik	and I like to think that I bought that GOTY for a reaosn :)
2014-12-20 06:50:45	azizLIGHT	And then I bought the day, after I heard the tiny Tina one is great

2014-12-20 06:51:36	azizLIGHT	Hmmm I'm in the same boat as you then
2014-12-20 06:51:58	tadzik	if you're in europe somewhere you can join me and Beamboom playing them :)
2014-12-20 06:52:10	azizLIGHT	We both played bl2, and have yet to play dlc, though we both own them
2014-12-20 06:52:11	tadzik	We've just started the pirate booty, beaten the first boss, whatever his name is
2014-12-20 06:52:25	tadzik	Smash? Sandman?
2014-12-20 06:52:29	azizLIGHT	Is there an order to the dlc?
2014-12-20 06:52:30	Dezponia_	If you enjoyed the base BL2 game you'll love the DLC because its signifcantly better
2014-12-20 06:52:49	--	Dezponia_ is now known as Dezponia
2014-12-20 06:53:28	Dezponia	Only the order they came out in. Non of them have any particular story relation between them. The only one that could be arguably be good to play last is Tiny Tinas Attack on Dragon Keep
2014-12-20 06:53:34	azizLIGHT	tadzik: my steam id is
2014-12-20 06:53:55	Dezponia	Because its the only one that ties into the main story and it ties up some loose ends around Tiny Tina
2014-12-20 06:54:02	Dezponia	So its a nice closer
2014-12-20 06:54:15	tadzik	Dezponia: do they scale up nicely to the players' levels?
2014-12-20 06:54:27	Dezponia	tadzik: They scale to the level you first entered them as
2014-12-20 06:54:33	tadzik	makes sense
2014-12-20 06:55:36	Dezponia	As someone who thinks Tiny Tina is the best character in BL2 her DLC was great. It also helps that its by far the the DLC with the most new content and most time put into it

2014-12-20 11:05:02	Morgawr	EllusionSK: wine is a compatibility layer that tries to run windows games on Linux, sometimes it works really well, some other times the games are buggy though
2014-12-20 11:05:22	Morgawr	you can check on winehq.org for user-written support summaries of various games and programs

2014-12-27 13:23:08	Sik	Although with the source code out and using SDL2 I wouldn't put it past people to eventually port it...
2014-12-27 13:23:21	Sik	(it's mostly fixing a few paths I think?)
2014-12-27 13:26:28	@Samsai	well, linking the libs and compiling it for the platform
2014-12-27 13:26:28	liamdawe	sobkas: we already have that info though

2014-12-27 13:26:28	@Samsai	i'm okay with that
2014-12-27 13:26:28	@Samsai	Sik, it has!
2014-12-27 13:26:28	Sik	Amusingly I think it may run on the Pandora out of the box
2014-12-27 13:26:28	@Samsai	it runs raspbian
2014-12-27 13:26:28	Sik	Although on the Pandora I'd make changes anyway to make it behave more like a handheld console :P
2014-12-27 13:26:28	Sik	(I don't think Sol would be playable on that keyboard)
2014-12-27 13:26:28	@Samsai	once you have the full version out, i'm going to try to throw some arm libraries at it and recompile the source for arm
2014-12-27 13:26:28	Sik	Sure :D
2014-12-27 13:26:28	Sik	It should be 32/64-bit clean if you wonder :S (since on Linux it's 64-bit but on Windows it's 32-bit)

2014-12-27 23:43:57	Thatsafy	damn, have nvidia linux drivers pumped up the performance or what? metro 2033 runs smooth almost maxed out, dead island works works great too and serious sam 3 runs so smooth all on ultra :D
2014-12-27 23:52:32	von	Thatsafy, what hardware and what driver version?
2014-12-27 23:57:22	Thatsafy	i7 4790, gtx 760 2GB with 340.65
2014-12-27 23:57:40	von	ah, okay
2014-12-27 23:58:09	von	I still can't SS3 smoothly on linux
2014-12-27 23:58:09	Thatsafy	last I tried SS3 before this I could run it fairly smooth at medium settings
2014-12-27 23:58:12	von	but on max
2014-12-27 23:58:34	Thatsafy	now fps is around 50-70, even when shooting enemies all around
2014-12-27 23:59:13	von	I still have to disable some fancy stuff
2014-12-27 23:59:18	von	to get more than 60 fps
2014-12-27 23:59:21	Thatsafy	got to admit that Dead Island port (while still being a shit game) runs great also
2014-12-27 23:59:32	von	I don't like Dead Island
2014-12-28 00:00:14	Thatsafy	which gpu do you have?
2014-12-28 00:00:58	von	gtx660 and i5-3570
2014-12-28 00:01:19	von	so yeah, I don't expect to squeeze out same performance as you have
2014-12-28 00:01:31	Thatsafy	ok, so not too far from mine as i7 isn't that much of a performance boost in gaming and 760 isn't too far from 760
2014-12-28 00:02:00	Thatsafy	you use the latest nvidia driver?
2014-12-28 00:02:22	von	yes, 343.36
2014-12-28 00:02:58	Thatsafy	those are beta drivers right?
2014-12-28 00:03:04	von	no, short lived branch
2014-12-28 00:06:46	von	oh, by the way
2014-12-28 00:07:04	von	Thatsafy, if fps varies too much in SS3 or The Talos Principle, try locking fps at 60
2014-12-28 00:07:13	von	limiting, rather
2014-12-28 00:07:43	von	for some reason their engine stutters without fps limit on linux
2014-12-28 00:08:55	Thatsafy	hmm, well it doesn't (for me) vary too much but might give it a try
2014-12-28 00:09:23	von	gfx_imaxfpsactive=60 in console
2014-12-28 00:13:10	Thatsafy	gave it a try, same smoothness as without for me, just "removed" 60 and over framerates, min. fps no difference
2014-12-28 00:13:49	Thatsafy	and only dips to that 50 when explosions happen anyway

2014-12-28 05:38:47	gnarface	NuSuey, stqn that happened to me after several hours of play time as well (i think it was between 6 and 9 hours that it occurred) do you guys also happen to have soundcards using the snd_hda_intel driver?
2014-12-28 05:39:29	NuSuey	I guess? but what I had was an issue when I start the game.. so guess it's something different
2014-12-28 05:39:39	gnarface	oh, yea i think thats different
2014-12-28 05:40:04	gnarface	but that is a problem i've also had with the hda_intel driver, many versions (years) ago
2014-12-28 05:40:23	xpander69	what problem
2014-12-28 05:40:30	gnarface	choppy sound
2014-12-28 05:40:42	xpander69	ohh ok
2014-12-28 05:40:49	gnarface	choppy/crackly i guess
2014-12-28 05:40:55	xpander69	i have hda_ati it seems
2014-12-28 05:41:17	xpander69	dont remember having problems with it
2014-12-28 05:41:19	gnarface	i recall there was a fix by overriding some buffer and period size settings in your ~/.asoundrc
2014-12-28 05:41:29	gnarface	but they fixed the driver and i never had that problem again
2014-12-28 05:42:05	gnarface	that was an issue with the thing buckling under too many sound streams/channels or whatever competing
2014-12-28 05:42:23	gnarface	the issue i had with civ5 is different, its fine for hours then eventually starts crackling
2014-12-28 05:42:30	gnarface	restarting the game fixes it
2014-12-28 05:42:42	xpander69	i think it might be the issue of /etc/pulse/daemon.conf fragment sizes are not correct for your soundcard then
2014-12-28 05:42:51	gnarface	oh i wasn't using pulse
2014-12-28 05:42:59	gnarface	but NuSuey and stqn may be...
2014-12-28 05:43:02	xpander69	ahh
2014-12-28 05:43:44	NuSuey	xpander69: yeah .. now it somehow works, don't want to mess with it anymore.. but I will get angry if it starts again after next reboot
2014-12-28 05:44:11	stqn	gnarface: yes, intel
2014-12-28 05:44:45	stqn	Civ 5 is the only game where it happens, although I don’t play most games more than 2 hours at a time…
2014-12-28 05:45:03	stqn	and not using pulse audio
2014-12-28 05:45:06	stqn	(alsa)
2014-12-28 05:45:37	xpander69	people always blamed pulseaudio for those issues
2014-12-28 05:45:42	xpander69	so it seems to be lower level issue then
2014-12-28 05:46:21	gnarface	i remember reading about it at one point in reference to something else and it was described as an issue with when the software opens a single audio stream to the hardware and keeps it open indefinitely
2014-12-28 05:46:49	xpander69	and spawns new ones constantly?=
2014-12-28 05:47:11	gnarface	no i think it like, just opens one stream and software muxes all the music and effects into it
2014-12-28 05:47:21	stqn	I’m pretty sure I played prison architect and game dev tycoon for many hours at a time, no sound issue with them.
2014-12-28 05:48:05	gnarface	which, i guess is different from how say world of warcraft and most other games do it, where they open many parallel streams and let the hardware/driver mux them, but also they close the streams when that particular sound effect or music sample ends
2014-12-28 05:48:09	xpander69	i have had similar issue with game called FORCED that when i start up the game its making weird noises for like 5 sec then goes back to normal
2014-12-28 05:48:16	xpander69	but thats the only game i know that makes this
2014-12-28 05:48:19	xpander69	and i have loooots of games
2014-12-28 05:48:55	gnarface	it shouldn't matter either way but i remember the hda_intel driver guys pointing fingers everywhere but at themselves
2014-12-28 05:49:20	xpander69	hmm
2014-12-28 05:49:35	gnarface	but i've had LOTS of issues in the old days with that driver on different hardware
2014-12-28 05:49:36	stqn	gnarface: every programmer does that :)
2014-12-28 05:49:40	xpander69	yesterday i played wow  like 6 hours in a row with music player playing as well and teamspeak3 etc... no issues
2014-12-28 05:49:48	gnarface	and its hard to say whether the issue is actually the driver even, or a problem with the hardware
2014-12-28 05:50:45	xpander69	dmesg doesnt show anything during that time?
2014-12-28 05:50:46	gnarface	since it apparently encompasses a whole bucket of different low-price onboard sound cards of dubious pedigree using a semi-standardized interface so they can use the same driver
2014-12-28 05:50:52	xpander69	like buffer underrunds or similar?
2014-12-28 05:50:57	xpander69	underruns*
2014-12-28 05:51:45	gnarface	hmmm...
2014-12-28 05:51:53	gnarface	good idea to check
2014-12-28 05:51:59	gnarface	i didn't think of that for some reason
2014-12-28 05:52:23	stqn	I’m not playing Civ 5 anymore so I don’t care :P
2014-12-28 05:52:29	xpander69	lol
2014-12-28 05:52:57	xpander69	and that is the reason it never gets fixed stqn :D
2014-12-28 05:53:02	xpander69	because you are not playing anymore :D
2014-12-28 05:53:05	stqn	eheh
2014-12-28 05:54:07	gnarface	hmm. not seeing anything in dmesg about it right now
2014-12-28 05:54:14	gnarface	but since it was a few days ago it might have already scrolled off
2014-12-28 05:54:14	stqn	anyway if it gets fixed then next year they’ll be using another chipset and another driver with other bugs
2014-12-28 05:54:35	stqn	(yes I’m optimistic like that)
2014-12-28 05:55:40	xpander69	oh it seems hda_ati is using also hda_intel driver:D

2014-12-28 06:42:43	stuartm	stqn: if it's anything like Last Light, the alternate endings are decided by how you play the game - kill lots of people, ignore chance of doing good deeds and don't listen to conversations  you get one ending and vice-versa

2014-12-28 06:43:57	stqn	it’s not like it’s possible to not kill everything/one in 2033
2014-12-28 06:44:02	ImperialXT	doing all the side non-essential/hidden ones now, which are much harder

2014-12-28 06:45:07	DerRidda	The bad "kill all the things" ending is the canonical one anyway.

2014-12-28 09:46:01	Leftmost	Happy-Ferret, all of their LEGO ports appear to be on Steam and to be SteamPlay.
2014-12-28 09:47:42	Happy-Ferret	Leftmost, wow. You're right! Must be new. The Hobbit definitely wasn't available for Mac on Steam when I bought it in late October. :)

2014-12-28 09:48:56	Happy-Ferret	Lego Lord of the Rings still appears to be Windows only though.
2014-12-28 09:58:36	kkit_	the lego games are good?
2014-12-28 09:58:49	Leftmost	In a sense.
2014-12-28 09:58:52	kkit_	the only lego game i've ever played was lego island, enough to sour me on the whole bunch
2014-12-28 09:59:02	Leftmost	They're all a bit samey-samey, but they're fun and amusing.
2014-12-28 09:59:23	Leftmost	There are some technical glitches, but not enough to keep me from buying pretty much every one of them.
2014-12-28 10:10:40	Happy-Ferret	Only played Indiana Jones (came with my XBOX360 Elite) and the demo of The Hobbit. Liking it very much. A must have for every completionist

2014-12-28 10:14:48	stqn	which one is worse?
2014-12-28 10:14:55	stqn	ah nice
2014-12-28 10:15:09	stqn	too bad nobody uses dailymotion
2014-12-28 10:15:16	Happy-Ferret	Yea. Shame
2014-12-28 10:15:22	gnarface	is dailymotion using html5 instead of flash?
2014-12-28 10:15:41	@Samsai	it's flash
2014-12-28 10:15:54	@Samsai	and the player they use eats all of your cpu
2014-12-28 10:15:55	linux_gamer	stuartm, you can get bioth endings by watching the video in steam folder ;-)
2014-12-28 10:16:18	linux_gamer	why does flash live on??
2014-12-28 10:16:36	gnarface	has to be brainwashing
2014-12-28 10:16:37	linux_gamer	was shit 10 years ago
2014-12-28 10:16:53	stqn	windows was also shit 10 years ago
2014-12-28 10:17:10	stqn	obviously no a criteria
2014-12-28 10:17:13	stqn	not
2014-12-28 10:17:41	gnarface	part of it is just installation density inertia
2014-12-28 10:18:02	gnarface	wasn't too long ago that flash was the only way to feasibly DO it that was already installed 97% of places

2014-12-28 10:18:43	Happy-Ferret	Perhaps it's just me, but I feel like Dailymotion's is a lot less compressed.
2014-12-28 10:19:18	gnarface	the other part of it is that the people who actually do the work in most companies (graphical artists and video editors) *REAAAALY* just think Adobe (and macromedia before them)  could do no wrong, but they're not the types of people who are on a whole known for being objective about technical decisions
2014-12-28 10:19:57	gnarface	Happy-Ferret: or it could just be compressed at a much higher quality, which could explain why it takes longer
2014-12-28 10:20:05	stqn	Happy-Ferret: at least the video isn’t being downloaded fast enough for me to watch it!
2014-12-28 10:20:36	stqn	but I also haven’t much success with 1080p videos on youtube

2014-12-28 10:33:06	stuartm	linux_gamer: flash mostly lives on because of video, and because HTML 5 video has until very recently lacked the capability for DRM
2014-12-28 10:34:40	stuartm	and of course html 5 video is a patent minefield, with some browser developers not wanting to implement H.264 decoding when it may mean paying future royalties to MPEG-LA
2014-12-28 10:36:39	stuartm	html video was also missing true streaming support, although there now seems to be momentum behind DASH for that, which is good - but altogether it's still a lot of hassle compared to just using flash to do the job
2014-12-28 10:43:49	linux_gamer	stuartm, ty

2014-12-29 11:06:32	gnarface	ok this is weird, i can no longer bind a key to push-to-talk in mumble
2014-12-29 11:06:49	gnarface	i can bind a mouse button just fine though
2014-12-29 11:07:26	gnarface	initial googling suggests that i would not be the first person to see this as a result of the way i set up permissions for my roccat mouse,
2014-12-29 11:07:42	gnarface	but it appears to be a bug in mumble
2014-12-29 11:08:11	gnarface	what is doubly weird though is i have the exact opposite problem in mangler (push-to-talk only now accepts a keyboard key, whereas before with my old mouse i was using a mouse button)
2014-12-29 11:08:33	gnarface	its a minor annoyance, since i probably would rather use a mouse button in most cases
2014-12-29 11:08:39	gnarface	but very weird
2014-12-29 11:09:22	gnarface	and nothing i see from my roccat mouse device permissions have affected any other device permissions that i can tell
2014-12-29 11:09:32	gnarface	...so weird
2014-12-29 11:11:01	gnarface	anyone else seeing this issue?
2014-12-29 11:12:01	gnarface	it might have something to do with the way these programs treat mice that look like usb hid keyboards, so it might also affect some razer mice
2014-12-29 11:12:33	gnarface	(like, maybe they just latch on to the first "keyboard" they find and ignores input from the others)
2014-12-29 11:13:19	gnarface	ideally i'd want to bind a keyboard *and* mouse button to push-to-talk

2014-12-30 08:15:13	frostwork	tadzik, it rocks!
2014-12-30 08:24:05	@Samsai	liamdawe, still quite crashy
2014-12-30 08:29:35	linux_gamer	aha now ther is activity in BI
2014-12-30 08:30:56	gnarface	battleblock theater is great
2014-12-30 08:31:03	linux_gamer	doesn't seem to be released this year but 2K should be right by early 2015
2014-12-30 08:31:29	gnarface	best played with a controller though
2014-12-30 08:31:40	gnarface	its one of those platformers that keyboard play is crippling on
2014-12-30 08:32:02	gnarface	personally i use an old Wii classic controller (with the mayflash usb adapter)
2014-12-30 08:32:39	kkit_	i just wish it had online multiplayer
2014-12-30 08:32:40	gnarface	most people without my particular prejudices though probably would want to go for the xbox360 controller, as its better supported in linux as well as steam (oh the irony)
2014-12-30 08:32:50	gnarface	battleblock theater? it doesn't have online multiplayer?
2014-12-30 08:32:53	kkit_	i didn't think so
2014-12-30 08:32:58	kkit_	i thought it was couch only
2014-12-30 08:33:03	gnarface	nah, its both
2014-12-30 08:33:38	gnarface	well, full disclosure, i haven't tested it outside my LAN, but the interface suggests it would work with anyone
2014-12-30 08:33:51	kkit_	i couldn't get it to work with a friend the time i tried
2014-12-30 08:33:59	gnarface	hmmm. odd
2014-12-30 08:34:12	gnarface	possibly a firewall issue, like i said, hadn't tested
2014-12-30 08:34:14	stuartm	do we know for certain yet whether BI is going to be native, or using eON (or similar)?
2014-12-30 08:34:53	tadzik	no
2014-12-30 08:34:59	tadzik	it's all speculation
2014-12-30 08:35:10	kkit_	i assume that firewall isn't an issue, since every other game manages it just fine
2014-12-30 08:35:46	gnarface	oh? how about hammerwatch?
2014-12-30 08:36:06	gnarface	*most* the games don't require port forwarding, but i know at least hammerwatch does
2014-12-30 08:36:21	kkit_	i don't know anyone who actually plays that
2014-12-30 08:36:29	kkit_	i beat it once and i'm never playing it again
2014-12-30 08:37:04	kkit_	i would have felt real ripped off if i had payed full price
2014-12-30 08:37:50	gnarface	yea it is a great idea but it could have used a lot more content, and it really didn't need to be made with mono, that was an insult
2014-12-30 08:38:02	gnarface	its better for multiplayer
2014-12-30 08:39:08	kkit_	it would have some replayability if there were some procedurally-generated elements to it, perhaps
2014-12-30 08:39:18	gnarface	perhaps
2014-12-30 08:39:22	kkit_	or a greater variety of any of the gameplay elements
2014-12-30 08:39:33	kkit_	it's kind of a one-trick pony
2014-12-30 08:39:46	gnarface	but anyway, battleblock theater *says* you can create a public or friends-only game, but i only tested it with a friend who happened to also be on my lan
2014-12-30 08:39:52	gnarface	never started a public game
2014-12-30 08:40:02	gnarface	but i DID once see *one* in the list
2014-12-30 08:40:08	gnarface	i just didn't try to join it
2014-12-30 08:40:22	kkit_	i dunno, i doubt we tried that hard to make it work
2014-12-30 08:40:36	gnarface	the interface is not very explicit about how to do it
2014-12-30 08:40:41	gnarface	it is strangely confusing
2014-12-30 08:41:54	gnarface	but if it requires port forwarding, then that would explain why the public game list was so empty; only someone without a firewall would show up
2014-12-30 08:42:54	 *	guig33k has bought serious sam 3 gold for linux
2014-12-30 08:43:05	kkit_	it seems like the sort of thing you shouldn't have to mess with, given that other games manage to do it right
2014-12-30 08:43:19	gnarface	but if i recall correctly, i think you have to go all the way through the character&item selection screen to the "stage" prompt for your game to show up on your friend's search
2014-12-30 08:43:42	kkit_	weird
2014-12-30 08:43:47	kkit_	maybe i'll give it another crack sometime
2014-12-30 08:43:56	gnarface	something about the interface makes that confusing, like you expect the game to be joinable before you're on the stage
2014-12-30 08:44:08	kkit_	you'd think you join at the character selection screen
2014-12-30 08:46:30	gnarface	i've played it multiplayer across the lan with my gf like 6 or 7 times now and every single time she can't find it and i have to walk over and help her
2014-12-30 08:46:43	gnarface	maybe it needs some better tooltips or narration for that process
2014-12-30 08:50:36	stuartm	starting to remember why I don't game through wine, it's just obnoxious - changing my screen resolution to 800x600, disabling my other monitors then crashing without restoring the previous state?
2014-12-30 08:51:16	stuartm	gee thanks Wine for that truely authentic Windows experience
2014-12-30 08:52:06	gnarface	stuartm: in winecfg check "emulate virtual desktop" and then set it to a static resolution (i recommend matching your native desktop resolution) then you should be able to set the games to "fullscreen" without jacking up your linux desktop
2014-12-30 08:52:46	gnarface	but for first-person shooters then you also have to check the option to lock the mouse to the window, and then you're stuck in it until you exit the game
2014-12-30 08:53:12	gnarface	(not required for all FPS games though; Rage seems to manage to do this without any help from wine)
2014-12-30 08:55:50	stuartm	thanks, might get me a little further before I decide to douse Wine in lighter fluid :)
2014-12-30 08:56:47	gnarface	its just about essential for dual-head configurations
2014-12-30 08:57:22	kkit_	there are linux games that will do that too
2014-12-30 08:57:30	kkit_	postal 2 holds on to my mouse and won't let go

2014-12-30 08:58:19	gnarface	try it ;)

2014-12-30 10:31:24	flesk_	Yeah, seems like they were pretty optimistic themselves with the last update.

2014-12-30 10:45:33	@Samsai	well, hamish is being hamish, nothing i can do about it
2014-12-30 10:46:23	FutureSuture	Samsai, no, I am saying that that is a legitimate concern.
2014-12-30 10:46:31	@Samsai	FutureSuture, oh
2014-12-30 10:46:37	@Samsai	well, i have to agree with that
2014-12-30 10:47:14	FutureSuture	The person arguing against your article on the previous page seemed to have talked you out of being concerned about this matter.
2014-12-30 10:47:23	FutureSuture	It clearly is a worrisome issue, though.
2014-12-30 10:47:34	FutureSuture	Hence why I am pointing your attention toward it, Samsai.
2014-12-30 10:49:46	@Samsai	let's see what happens
2014-12-30 10:51:29	@Samsai	but i do need to find more topics to write about, my recent non GOL Cast articles have been full of controversy and negativity
2014-12-30 10:53:14	FutureSuture	My last one was, too, Samsai.
2014-12-30 10:53:14	stuartm	it ain't DRM though, hate that term being mis-used
2014-12-30 10:53:22	FutureSuture	My next one will probably be too.
2014-12-30 11:05:38	flesk_	Have any of you considered writing about Star Wars: Battlecry? It's an interesting project but not really my kind of game.
2014-12-30 11:06:30	flesk_	Could be nice to accompany it with a short interview, asking the developers about legal worries and their view on the upcoming official Battlefront game.
2014-12-30 11:06:56	Dezponia	Why would they use RAR out of all formats...
2014-12-30 11:06:57	flesk_	And things like what kind of tools they use, if they are Linux users, etc.
2014-12-30 11:08:07	flesk_	There's also this game that hasn't been covered: http://zomboko.com/crossingtheline.php

2014-12-30 11:37:34	@Samsai	liamdawe, does this new client have anything to even write about?
2014-12-30 11:37:45	@Samsai	i downloaded it, it's exactly like the previous one
2014-12-30 11:37:45	gnarface	RAR is the compression format of remorseless evildoers
2014-12-30 11:37:54	@Samsai	it even crashes just the same
2014-12-30 11:38:08	liamdawe	Samsai: not sure, but the fact that it's properly open source again is noteworthy enough
2014-12-30 11:38:27	@Samsai	liamdawe, that's true
2014-12-30 11:39:08	gnarface	one day someone was like "wow, this ZIP stuff is ubiquitous, free, open, reliable, and completely platform independent.  how can we fix all that?" bam! RAR
2014-12-30 11:39:48	@Samsai	rawr
2014-12-30 11:39:49	gnarface	the devil's own compression format
2014-12-30 11:40:29	gnarface	more malware, nagware, scamware, and piracy has been transported in RAR than in any other compression format

2014-12-30 12:07:15	gnarface	eh... could be done just annoying
2014-12-30 12:07:38	gnarface	like, when one person brings up vats, the other players would basically have to be forced into pause until they finished queueing up their shots
2014-12-30 12:08:01	gnarface	but that's basically how the arcade D&D games work when you play with a mage, so its doable
2014-12-30 12:08:02	gnarface	just annoying
2014-12-30 12:08:29	gnarface	literally, in shadow over mystara, when the mage goes to cast a spell, everyone else gets frozen until their cast completes
2014-12-30 12:08:42	gnarface	(people who only play fighters tend to get annoyed with this and rage quit)

2014-12-30 14:01:45	gnarface	ho
2014-12-30 14:01:47	gnarface	i mean oh
2014-12-30 14:02:02	@Samsai	and yeah, it's a normal broadband, it's just not very broad
2014-12-30 14:02:43	@Samsai	but this mobile connection, oh, we are going to go far with this one
2014-12-30 14:02:50	gnarface	yea in the US if you're transmitting certain data (anything useful or encrypted) the major providers throttle you, but they're really good about avoiding actually accientally throttling the metering sites
2014-12-30 14:03:55	gnarface	so for example, its easy to be a comcast provider and THINK you're always getting your full advertised bandwidth but mysteriously the VPN to your company's headquarters is always slow so you just blame it on your IT department
2014-12-30 14:04:18	@Samsai	well, that's not the case here
2014-12-30 14:04:31	@Samsai	our broadband quite simply sucks and is completely outdated
2014-12-30 14:04:35	gnarface	hell, its probably ILLEGAL there
2014-12-30 14:04:51	@Samsai	i imagine it is
2014-12-30 14:06:09	gnarface	its probably illegal here too, in fact, but our judicial system is almost entirely staffed by luddites
2014-12-30 14:06:33	@Samsai	the only issue with this connection is the high ping but everything else is just wonderful with this one
2014-12-30 14:07:22	gnarface	although, you said your advertised upload was 3 megabits on the broadband connection?
2014-12-30 14:07:31	gnarface	its surprising to me still you're getting faster than that on 3g
2014-12-30 14:07:52	@Samsai	actually that one was from a screwed up mobile speed test
2014-12-30 14:08:06	@Samsai	it said that the download was 3 mbps

2014-12-30 14:08:30	@Samsai	but with the phone connected to my desktop and running the speed test there i got those results
2014-12-30 14:09:13	gnarface	i've never managed to see more than about 750kbps sustained on a 3g connection

2014-12-30 14:09:34	gnarface	but in the US the cellphone network providers are pretty much universally criminal
2014-12-30 14:09:50	@Samsai	they advertised this one as the fastest possible 3G connection
2014-12-30 14:09:58	@Samsai	for anything faster i'd have to go 4G
2014-12-30 14:15:23	@Samsai	livestreaming at 1000 kbps, not a single dropped frame

2014-12-30 14:43:02	huw	cold and dark suits me fine

2014-12-30 14:43:55	gnarface	its 69F here and i feel freaking cold
2014-12-30 14:44:10	@Samsai	it's relatively warm in here at the moment
2014-12-30 14:44:13	@Samsai	4 celsius
2014-12-30 14:44:23	stuartm	F ? Use proper units man

2014-12-30 14:45:32	@Samsai	20 celsius is cold?

2014-12-30 14:45:42	stqn	20°C *is* cold :P
2014-12-30 14:46:06	gnarface	i'm sure someone in finland would be wearing shorts and a t-shirt at that temperature

2014-12-30 14:46:37	@Samsai	20C is like the best possible weather
2014-12-30 14:47:50	gnarface	i guess i prefer 23.8889C, according to google
2014-12-30 14:48:07	gnarface	that 3 degrees seems like a very vast difference
2014-12-30 14:48:53	@Samsai	it does
2014-12-30 14:49:01	gnarface	anywhere from 29.45C to 23.89C is fine for me, below that i'm looking for a blanket
2014-12-30 14:49:08	@Samsai	when it gets to around 24C it's too hot
2014-12-30 14:49:33	@Samsai	18-22C is the optimal
2014-12-30 14:50:55	stuartm	over 27C and I melt
2014-12-30 14:51:40	flesk_	Samsai: I agree. 20C is perfect. 30C is way too hot.
