2014-03-21 14:56:33	FutureSuture	Hello
2014-03-21 14:57:19	FutureSuture	Anybody here?
2014-03-21 14:57:25	Noxbru	I am
2014-03-21 14:57:33	Noxbru	what's up?
2014-03-21 14:58:17	FutureSuture	I have had a ton of LInux problems ever since I built my new rig. UEFI, distros not using the latest kernel which is needed for AMD's open source drivers, and so on.
2014-03-21 14:58:32	FutureSuture	Luckily, Antergos has kernel 3.13 via the testing image
2014-03-21 14:58:57	FutureSuture	Nevertheless...
2014-03-21 14:59:01	Noxbru	ehm... little correction: Antergos has kernel 3.13 because that's the latest stable kernel
2014-03-21 15:00:22	FutureSuture	But the download page says "2013.11.17"
2014-03-21 15:00:33	FutureSuture	Kernel 3.13 wasn't out then.
2014-03-21 15:01:22	FutureSuture	Well, whatever, I have kernel 3.13 via the testing image. I have successfully installed Antergos twice now but this newly built computer of mine won't boot Antergos and I have no idea why.
2014-03-21 15:01:44	Noxbru	does it shows any kind of log?
2014-03-21 15:01:55	FutureSuture	Nope
2014-03-21 15:02:13	FutureSuture	At Antergos boots with the live USB stick unlike Manjaro, openSUSE, and GParted Live.
2014-03-21 15:02:17	FutureSuture	*At least
2014-03-21 15:02:32	Noxbru	ok, when you boot, could you please edit the first entry and remove the word "quiet"
2014-03-21 15:03:12	WarheadsSE	And are you using legacy boot or uefi boot from your mobo?
2014-03-21 15:03:14	FutureSuture	Boot the live USB stick, you mean?
2014-03-21 15:03:37	Noxbru	no, your installed system
2014-03-21 15:03:54	Noxbru	legacy boot, my laptop doesn't have uefi
2014-03-21 15:04:01	FutureSuture	I have it set to UEFI & and Legacy but unlike with Manjaro live USB sticks, Antergos live USB sticks do not show up with a UEFI option.
2014-03-21 15:04:10	Noxbru	sorry, I thought you asked my
2014-03-21 15:04:12	Noxbru	me*
2014-03-21 15:06:23	FutureSuture	Where would I remove any entries when booting an installed system?
2014-03-21 15:06:54	FutureSuture	I currently have nothing installed as I just wiped the SSD after installing various Linux distros at least 6 times today.
2014-03-21 15:16:23	FutureSuture	Anybody?
2014-03-21 15:25:46	Aethysius	Antergos or SourceMage.
2014-03-21 15:25:53	Aethysius	Oh.
2014-03-21 15:25:57	Aethysius	Ooops.
2014-03-21 15:26:21	Aethysius	Hmm.
2014-03-21 15:26:34	Aethysius	Not sure on that one. :/

2014-03-21 15:28:57	Noxbru	Michaleo, 3.10
2014-03-21 15:29:02	Noxbru	latest stable
2014-03-21 15:29:12	WarheadsSE	As per the Arch upstream
2014-03-21 15:29:18	FutureSuture	WarheadsSE: That is correct. When installing, I always set my own sizes for / and /home and don't use swap as I have enough RAM.
2014-03-21 15:29:36	WarheadsSE	FutureSuture: okay, and what bootloader are you using/
2014-03-21 15:29:51	FutureSuture	15GB for /, the rest for /home, 16GB RAM so no swap
2014-03-21 15:30:20	Michaleo	Noxbru thanks...so i guess on march 26 antergos/arch linux will have the gnome 3.12 too?or it maye take a while?!
2014-03-21 15:30:21	FutureSuture	What bootloader? No idea. Whatever comes in the installer for Antergos, Manjaro, GParted Live, and openSUSE.
2014-03-21 15:31:15	WarheadsSE	okay, so I will start back at are you using uEFI or legacy from your mobo?
2014-03-21 15:32:22	Noxbru	Michaleo, it usually takes a while. It stays for some time at testing and if nothing happens it gets to the stable repos
2014-03-21 15:32:43	Noxbru	Michaleo, maybe a week or so if everything goes smoothly
2014-03-21 15:32:59	WarheadsSE	There are a lot of things that have to get rebuild against it and tested
2014-03-21 15:34:06	Michaleo	ok interesting :) i love the idea of a rolling distro because i am tired from the reinstall every 6 or 9 months!!! i love also the dejavu default fonts ;) too polished desktop! but i hate the choose of chromium as default browser! Chromium is the most ugly browser ever...
2014-03-21 15:34:56	FutureSuture	WarheadsSE: I have set the option to be "UEFI & Legacy" which means that USB sticks I wish to boot show up as UEFI: USB Stick or just USB Stick in the boot menu. With Antergos, there is no UEFI option. I used SUSE Image Writer to create a live USB stick using the testing image as I apparently need kernel 3.13 to see anything with this GPU.
2014-03-21 15:34:58	Noxbru	well, you can always change it, one of the first things I did was install firefox
2014-03-21 15:37:59	WarheadsSE	Okay, so you have yet to install Antegros to the disk?
2014-03-21 15:38:14	WarheadsSE	I think I am missing what your problem is

2014-03-21 15:40:44	FutureSuture	I installed it twice already today, WarheadsSE, and it wouldn't boot. Said something about inserting the boot media or whatever.

2014-03-21 15:40:59	FutureSuture	I can install it again and give you the exact words if you need them, WarheadsSE.
2014-03-21 15:42:53	Michaleo	Noxbru indeed!!! but i am just curious why to be choosed as a default hehe!
2014-03-21 15:42:56	WarheadsSE	No, I have a feeeling that you need to install it, and then before rebooting make sure you have an efi capable bootloader working.
2014-03-21 15:43:07	WarheadsSE	Michaleo: because some people really like it
2014-03-21 15:43:39	Michaleo	i wish i could understand what they see into it :D but i guess sometimes love is blind :D
2014-03-21 15:43:41	Michaleo	haha
2014-03-21 15:46:11	WarheadsSE	Lets not go starting a flamefest here.
2014-03-21 15:46:23	WarheadsSE	Remember, some people still think IE is the best.
2014-03-21 15:46:37	WarheadsSE	there be dragons in flame wars
2014-03-21 15:46:44	Noxbru	some people don't know other thing
2014-03-21 15:47:26	FutureSuture	WarheadsSE: Isn't Grub an EFI capable bootloader?
2014-03-21 15:47:45	WarheadsSE	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB_EFI_Examples
2014-03-21 15:48:22	WarheadsSE	if you notice, grub-efi is a different package.
2014-03-21 15:48:55	WarheadsSE	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Grub#UEFI_systems
2014-03-21 15:49:15	WarheadsSE	might not hurt to check which one ends up installed before rebooting.
2014-03-21 15:50:36	Michaleo	WarheadsSE indeed no intentions for flamefest :) i think its good anyway people to disagree and discuss it :D at the end of day we are free to choose so much software ;)
2014-03-21 15:51:02	WarheadsSE	FutureSuture: I have to go now, but hopefully the hints will help.
2014-03-21 15:52:33	FutureSuture	Thank you, WarheadsSE
2014-03-21 15:52:40	FutureSuture	I will install once more and hope it works
2014-03-21 15:53:23	Michaleo	FutureSuture the only tricky part that you may need to be carefull is to make sure to GTP format you hard disk instead of MBR
2014-03-21 15:54:48	FutureSuture	Michaleo: That doesn't come up during the installation process
2014-03-21 15:55:12	Michaleo	on Antergos?!
2014-03-21 15:55:18	Michaleo	you can try before you install
2014-03-21 15:55:30	Michaleo	to make it with GPARTED via live usb/cd ;) and then install
2014-03-21 15:55:59	Michaleo	Tip: When using Gparted, selecting the option to create a new partition table gives an "msdos" partition table by default. If you are intending to follow the advice to create a GPT partition table then you need to choose "Advanced" and then select "gpt" from the drop-down menu.
2014-03-21 15:56:25	Michaleo	so you lunch a antergos live usb/cd and you make the partioning via gparted and then you install
2014-03-21 16:02:05	FutureSuture	I don't see "Advanced" anywhere :-(
2014-03-21 16:04:08	FutureSuture	No, wait, found it
2014-03-21 16:04:18	FutureSuture	I have never done this before -_-
2014-03-21 16:05:49	FutureSuture	Michaleo: "Invalid partition table - recursive partition on /dev/sdb."
2014-03-21 16:06:18	FutureSuture	WHo cares about sdb? I am trying to do this on sda.
2014-03-21 16:07:43	Michaleo	maybe you choosed sdb?
2014-03-21 16:08:08	Michaleo	you have other installed oS?
2014-03-21 16:08:14	Michaleo	using two partitions?
2014-03-21 16:08:21	FutureSuture	Nope. I built this computer entirely for Linux.
2014-03-21 16:08:21	Michaleo	like C: and D:
2014-03-21 16:08:30	Michaleo	so sdb what is? :D
2014-03-21 16:08:52	FutureSuture	I have disconnected 2 HDDs, left the SSD connected for / and /home, and am installing via a live USB stick of 8GB.
2014-03-21 16:10:27	Michaleo	ok so now you should and gparted just see one hard disk which is the SSD one...
2014-03-21 16:10:56	FutureSuture	Well, and the USB stick of 8GB which I am using to install ANtergos
2014-03-21 16:11:16	FutureSuture	It says the partition table for the SSD is gpt
2014-03-21 16:11:32	Michaleo	well you have just to choose the SSD one hard disk which sould be represented as sda i guess?!
2014-03-21 16:11:40	Michaleo	ok so if it is
2014-03-21 16:11:45	Michaleo	you just go for the intallation
2014-03-21 16:11:54	Michaleo	with easy antergos "chichi" named installer :)
2014-03-21 16:12:14	Michaleo	so no more mess with gparted and partioning :)
2014-03-21 16:14:01	FutureSuture	I don't think I changed anything and that it was gpt all along
2014-03-21 16:14:12	FutureSuture	I am at a point where I am just hoping for LInux miracles.
2014-03-21 16:14:18	FutureSuture	I have been at this for days.
2014-03-21 16:14:34	Michaleo	oh if it is like then no worries ;) maybe you wasted some time but nothing to set up ;)
2014-03-21 16:14:42	Michaleo	dont worry! the first steps maybe its sometimes kinda stressy
2014-03-21 16:14:59	Michaleo	but when you go linux or a unix based like OS you never come back
2014-03-21 16:15:01	Michaleo	;)
2014-03-21 16:15:02	FutureSuture	Reddit, Phoronix, Manjaro forum, Manjaro IRC, wikis, nothing and nobody could help.
2014-03-21 16:15:24	Michaleo	just install it via antergos live usb
2014-03-21 16:15:34	Michaleo	you ll see ;) it will go so easy
2014-03-21 16:16:06	FutureSuture	On my previous computer, Linux just boots and installs the way I want it to. With this new machine, nothing works :P
2014-03-21 16:16:13	FutureSuture	Where are you from, Michaleo ?
2014-03-21 16:17:35	Michaleo	hehe i want to install soon a arch linux too but first i have to make a so boring back up....
2014-03-21 16:17:40	Michaleo	i am from Greece m8:)
2014-03-21 16:17:43	Michaleo	island Crete
2014-03-21 16:17:47	FutureSuture	I see!
2014-03-21 16:17:50	FutureSuture	It's late over there
2014-03-21 16:18:15	FutureSuture	I am a poor malaka trying to install Linux :-(
2014-03-21 16:19:17	Michaleo	looool!! :D you know word malaka! we (Greeks) made this naughty word international! what a shame ! LOL! dont worry man ;) i was also a big annoying malaka even when i tried to install ubuntu for first time :D where are you from?
2014-03-21 16:19:42	FutureSuture	Austria but I am currently studying in the UK
2014-03-21 16:19:51	FutureSuture	My previous university had so many Greeks
2014-03-21 16:19:55	FutureSuture	Greeks and Chinese
2014-03-21 16:20:12	FutureSuture	A Greek once told me that there are 10 million Greeks in Greece, and 10 million Greeks outside Greece.
2014-03-21 16:21:22	Michaleo	oh :) love Austria and German ppl ;) i guess you studing something about computers?! hm i dont know about statistics but i know for sure a lot greeks are outside working on many countries...and i know also that alot Greeks are malakas :D
2014-03-21 16:22:27	FutureSuture	Did Business Management for my bachelor's but felt it was boring and too easy. I have always been interested in computers and so I decided to do my master's in Computing & Information Systems
2014-03-21 16:24:55	Michaleo	interesting :) its kinda funny because i am study computers science in Greece and believe me man it really sucks studing computer science in Greece because Greek universities have a bad ideology...having in their studies programmes A  LOT lessons that are kinda unessesary like TOOOOO MANY mathematics for a programmer or network guy! or Circuits theory etc...and digital signal...
2014-03-21 16:25:29	Michaleo	so i was thinking to leave it and go for business management but i dint since i think that it would be great to make a master later in Europe on computers
2014-03-21 16:35:01	FutureSuture	Greek universities sound diffixult
2014-03-21 16:35:09	FutureSuture	But at least you'll be professionals in the end
2014-03-21 16:35:26	FutureSuture	I am doing java for the first time...we only get 4 hours of teaching a week.
2014-03-21 16:35:45	FutureSuture	useless
2014-03-21 16:39:40	Michaleo	Yes they are diffucult but i think (at least at my science -computers) that they are not making a good job...because the point is to learn you a lot practical things and not wast ECTS for mathematics or lessons that dont have to much with programming...
2014-03-21 16:39:52	Michaleo	we have also JUST ONE lesson for java
2014-03-21 16:40:10	Michaleo	anyway i think i like more web programming stuff...
2014-03-21 16:41:12	FutureSuture	No, the entire module is about java, but we only get 4 hours a week, 2 of which are about theory
2014-03-21 16:42:31	FutureSuture	Antergos is done installing. I just hope it works this time...
2014-03-21 16:42:41	FutureSuture	See you in a bit, Michaleo
2014-03-21 16:43:42	Michaleo	wow i am great that you made it ;)
2014-03-21 16:43:44	Michaleo	yes Java have many aspects...android, web appls,local java...
2014-03-21 16:43:49	Michaleo	hope to hear that it works like a charm!

2014-03-21 16:55:09	armin_	Michaleo: It worked
2014-03-21 16:55:10	armin_	FINALLY
2014-03-21 16:59:12	Michaleo	:D it wasnt so hard it was?:D
2014-03-21 16:59:37	Michaleo	so?Did you installed gnome 3? :D
2014-03-21 17:01:30	armin_	It was hard because Manjaro, openSUSE, GParted Live, and all the others did not work
2014-03-21 17:01:41	armin_	Nobody suggested anything regarding partition tables
2014-03-21 17:01:47	armin_	Antergos does it for you in the installer
2014-03-21 17:01:54	armin_	No, KDE of course
2014-03-21 17:04:34	Michaleo	i think Fedora does it too and maybe Opensuse
2014-03-21 17:04:40	Michaleo	KDE?ah man :D gnome 3 rocks!
2014-03-21 17:04:50	Michaleo	OS X style and many social integrations :D
2014-03-21 17:04:53	armin_	I prefer KDE :P
2014-03-21 17:05:02	Michaleo	yeah KDE its powerful too
2014-03-21 17:05:06	armin_	Next up: How does one install Steam in Antergos?
2014-03-21 17:05:16	armin_	Can't find it in the package manager
2014-03-21 17:05:17	Noxbru	sudo pacman -S steam
2014-03-21 17:05:28	Noxbru	have you updated the databases?
2014-03-21 17:06:04	Noxbru	I see it in multilib repo
2014-03-21 17:06:10	Michaleo	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam#Native_Steam_on_Linux
2014-03-21 17:06:51	armin_	sudo pacman -Syyu
2014-03-21 17:06:54	armin_	is what I did
2014-03-21 17:07:48	Noxbru	well... in the wiki page Michaleo linked says that if you are using 64 bits you have to enable multilib
2014-03-21 17:08:33	armin_	I see
2014-03-21 17:08:40	armin_	Manjaro has been spoiling me silly apparently
2014-03-21 17:08:48	Michaleo	Noxbru yeah :) its a detail but important :D
2014-03-21 17:09:55	Noxbru	tend to forget this things if you do it just once
2014-03-21 17:10:17	Noxbru	you know... wasn't this enabled since the begining?
2014-03-21 17:11:32	Michaleo	multilab?!
2014-03-21 17:11:53	Michaleo	well i havent tried still expect usb live antergos
2014-03-21 17:14:04	armin_	multilib installed
2014-03-21 17:14:09	armin_	Thank you so much, guys
2014-03-21 17:14:28	armin_	This is what learning feels like = not failing all the bloody time
2014-03-21 17:14:52	armin_	multilib-devel in Arch is multilib-testing in Antergos, correct?
2014-03-21 17:15:28	Noxbru	I think, whatever it is in Arch is the same in Antergos, as Antergos is Arch based
2014-03-21 17:16:17	armin_	There is no multilib-devel in pacman.conf, just multilib-testing
2014-03-21 17:16:44	Michaleo	yeah Noxbru but i dint knew if multilab is installed by default when you install antergos or you have to do it manually later
2014-03-21 17:16:58	Michaleo	armin_ my austrian friend i am glad that you enjoy it :D
2014-03-21 17:17:10	Noxbru	honestly, I don't remember it either...
2014-03-21 17:19:34	Michaleo	Noxbru this the reason that i believe that firstly it would be great to make a clean install of Arch
2014-03-21 17:19:48	Michaleo	and later on you can go antergos
2014-03-21 17:20:21	Noxbru	but installing Arch is a bit... slow? boring? difficult without the wiki?
2014-03-21 17:21:24	armin_	How do I check what graphics driver I am running? glxinfo | grep OpenGL isn't doing the trick.
2014-03-21 17:21:39	Noxbru	pacman -Qs dri ?
2014-03-21 17:21:59	Noxbru	for me it's ati-dri
2014-03-21 17:23:11	armin_	It's not very encouraging to google this stuff when you get false answers and you're giving me correct answer straight away :-P
2014-03-21 17:23:40	Noxbru	another way is to just know what graphics card you have
2014-03-21 17:24:02	armin_	I know which one I have, but it's between proprietary and open source drivers and I want to use the latter
2014-03-21 17:24:30	Noxbru	I think that an antergos just installed it uses the open source drivers
2014-03-21 17:24:42	armin_	Great!
2014-03-21 17:24:43	Michaleo	Noxbru indeed its slow for sure (30 or 40 minutes at least!) and maybe very hard without wiki but well it will be good at least one time in your life to do it lol!
2014-03-21 17:24:48	armin_	I am really starting to dig Antergos
2014-03-21 17:25:28	armin_	Just noticed your message, Michaleo, thank you. :-) It's been a tough few days. New hardware, no software that works!
2014-03-21 17:26:22	Michaleo	all my pleasure for you mine my friend ;) hehe you ll get used it! for now i have trouble to install the drivers of a internet USB stick (mobile internet) on my laptop
2014-03-21 17:26:28	Michaleo	that is running fedora 20 atm
2014-03-21 17:26:55	armin_	I went from Ubuntu to Mint to openSUSE to Manjaro and now I am on Antergos. Getting closer to Arch. :P
2014-03-21 17:27:14	Noxbru	Michaleo, well I only did it once, in a virtual machine, and I didn't know what graphics driver to choose XD
2014-03-21 17:27:23	Noxbru	have to go, bye!

2014-04-28 09:16:04	Llewelyn	Morning. I stumbled across something amusing while poking at the gnome shell extenstion package to provide a light dm lockscreen for gnome. The package contains symlinks to files in faidoc's home directory that aren't distributed with the package.
2014-04-28 09:18:09	Noxbru	really? you should file a bug then I think
2014-04-28 09:18:52	Llewelyn	Or verify that one hasn't already been filed and then file one.
2014-04-28 09:20:21	Noxbru	hey it's true!
2014-04-28 09:20:47	Noxbru	mmm.... well.... let's see if we can at least make it work
2014-04-28 09:23:06	Noxbru	https://github.com/Antergos/antergos-packages/tree/master/gnome-shell-extension-lockscreen-lightdm here you have the two files that supposedly has to have the extension
2014-04-28 09:24:56	Llewelyn	Indeed. Should be easy to pull and place.
2014-04-28 09:25:12	Llewelyn	I don't see a report for this bug so working on filing it.
2014-04-28 09:26:11	Noxbru	yep, maybe faidoc was working with symlinks in his git tree

2014-04-28 09:38:48	Munrek	hey guys, since linux 3.13 PS/2 keyboard are disabled and it can't prevent people to install antergos ... if you could make something for us, the ones with dusty hardware it would be nice :)
2014-04-28 09:39:31	Munrek	the fix is not difficult to make, just load the module "atkbd"
2014-04-28 09:40:09	Noxbru	hi Munrek, a better place for this would be the bug tracker, I think
2014-04-28 09:40:12	Noxbru	or even the forums
2014-04-28 09:40:34	Noxbru	I'm not sure, but I think there's no dev here
2014-04-28 09:40:57	Munrek	indeed, did not see there is a bugtracker, thank you
2014-04-28 09:41:45	Noxbru	http://bugs.antergos.com/index.php?project=0&do=index&switch=1
2014-04-28 09:41:51	Noxbru	you are welcome
2014-04-28 09:52:39	Llewelyn	I think Noxbru is the only user even here most the time.
2014-04-28 09:53:38	Noxbru	maybe, but I'm not usually of much help as I don't follow lately the development of Antergos
2014-04-28 09:53:49	Noxbru	and I don't know in what are working the devs
2014-04-28 10:10:36	Llewelyn	So far it seems they have been focusing on polishing the distribution and making it look like a finished product. switcing to lightdm and building a pretty greeter, pushing out a graphical grub theme. Bit more polish on cnchi.
2014-04-28 10:11:49	Noxbru	when I installed it "for the last time" it didn't have lightdm, or grub themes :) I think that you couldn't even chose if you wanted libreoffice installed by default!
2014-04-28 10:12:08	Llewelyn	I don't recall being able to choose that.
2014-04-28 10:12:19	Noxbru	I have sounded like one of those old mans who say "in my times..."
2014-04-28 10:12:25	Noxbru	you are know I think
2014-04-28 10:12:37	Llewelyn	Lots of backend options tho... like full on fs menu and drive layout.
2014-04-28 10:12:52	Llewelyn	Indeed.
2014-04-28 10:14:14	Llewelyn	The only weird thing about the light dm switch is how integrated gdm is into gnome. It behaves a bit differently with other greeters.
2014-04-28 10:14:59	Noxbru	yes, but if you are going to have an openbox, I highly doubt that you need full gdm
2014-04-28 10:15:29	Noxbru	lightdm is a nice choice if you want to have something that "works everywhere"
2014-04-28 10:15:39	Noxbru	and you can replace it for gdm quite easily
2014-04-28 10:16:24	Llewelyn	Pacman does make installation super easy... switching them via systemctl is a little less obvious.
2014-04-28 10:16:58	Noxbru	indeed

2014-04-28 11:59:37	heavensrevenge	hi
2014-04-28 12:00:00	heavensrevenge	is there a way to switch de's from the lightdm greeter??
2014-04-28 12:21:45	<--	Noxbru (~noxbru@46.27.199.21) has left #antergos
2014-04-28 12:31:33	Llewelyn	Yes.
2014-04-28 12:32:44	heavensrevenge	how is the session or de switchable from that lightdm theme?
2014-04-28 12:32:46	Llewelyn	You can install any dm you choose via pacman. You will then need to disable lightdm via systemctl and enable your new display manager. You can then uninstall lightdm.
2014-04-28 12:33:28	Llewelyn	If you are using gnome you can install gdm by running: pacman -S gdm
2014-04-28 12:33:54	heavensrevenge	lightdm should be able to select the de
2014-04-28 12:34:28	heavensrevenge	like sure we can do it manually but it wud be nice for that theme to incorperate switching
2014-04-28 12:34:32	Llewelyn	I can switch to any DE you install via pacman as can GDM
2014-04-28 12:35:27	Llewelyn	I think the only DM that requires special settings to select a DE to start at login is KDM
2014-04-28 12:36:01	Llewelyn	lightdm and GDM both provide a list of available session options to users logging in.
2014-04-28 12:37:07	heavensrevenge	instead o not on our theme
2014-04-28 12:37:17	heavensrevenge	our theme hides switching the de
2014-04-28 12:37:25	heavensrevenge	it has everything but
2014-04-28 12:41:19	Llewelyn	you can always change the lightdm default session if it isn't giving you a list of avaiable DEs
2014-04-28 12:43:11	Llewelyn	The developers may not have finished with the lightdm theme and it may lack that support. None of them seem to hang out here to help.
2014-04-28 12:43:34	heavensrevenge	>.>
2014-04-28 12:43:51	heavensrevenge	ill make a github issue for it if none are here lol
2014-04-28 12:44:39	Llewelyn	bugs.antergos.com is the central issue list I believe.
2014-04-28 12:49:53	Llewelyn	What options does the webkit greeter give you from the pulldown menu after password prompt and login button? Which DEs do you have installed you want it switch between?
2014-04-28 12:54:59	heavensrevenge	your fairly new to here i suppose?i was just checking if 1 of the guys were in here so i didnt needt o file a githib issue

2014-04-28 21:38:20	Llewelyn	Hello Chris.
2014-04-28 21:39:51	Llewelyn	The best way to restore your flash drive is to use a tool like partition tool to create a new blank partition table for the device and a FAT32 partition consuming the avalable space.
2014-04-28 21:40:15	Llewelyn	Whoops, sentence got a bit away from me.
2014-04-28 21:41:08	Llewelyn	fdisk, gparted or  the gnome disk tool can help you clear the drive and return it to everyday use.

2014-04-29 17:37:36	Multimandala	hello folks, I'm about to plunge in antergos, as I'm just so tired of my really good computer being slow and buggy on ubuntu. I really like Cinnamon, I'm used to it, and I am wondering if we get version 2.0 or 2.2+ available ? [ I'm sure I can get some equivalent look with KDE, but still ], so is Cinnamon still maintained / made available in newer packages ? [ And my next big step wil lthen be to get vmware workstation workin

2014-05-01 12:23:01	Noxbru	may I ask, what version are you using?
2014-05-01 12:23:22	hamidrezakp	last version
2014-05-01 12:23:54	Noxbru	you mean the testing image?
2014-05-01 12:23:57	hamidrezakp	 on virtualbox it is ok but on system not working
2014-05-01 12:24:02	hamidrezakp	 no
2014-05-01 12:24:27	Noxbru	which one then?
2014-05-01 12:24:43	Noxbru	if it's a stable one it is a bit old

2014-05-01 12:29:20	hamidrezakp	this is my version of antergod
2014-05-01 12:29:23	Noxbru	yes, that's the last stable iso, but is from november of last year
2014-05-01 12:29:55	Noxbru	it's usually recomended to use the latest testing and a liveUSB
2014-05-01 12:30:35	hamidrezakp	whast is the best program to bootable usb flash?
2014-05-01 12:30:55	Noxbru	and, if even using the latest testing iso you have problems with the installer, to use the testing branch of cnchi: http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1285
2014-05-01 12:31:01	Noxbru	I usually use dd
2014-05-01 12:32:14	hamidrezakp	please tel me the dd code for usb writing
2014-05-01 12:34:19	hamidrezakp	are you alife? :)
2014-05-01 12:35:41	Noxbru	i think it was somewhere in the forums but the arch wiki is also helpful
2014-05-01 12:35:44	Noxbru	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Flash_Installation_Media#Using_dd
2014-05-01 12:35:59	Noxbru	yeah, I'm alive, I was looking at Arch's wiki
2014-05-01 12:36:26	Noxbru	what you need is something like this:
2014-05-01 12:36:28	Noxbru	'dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx && sync'
2014-05-01 12:36:42	hamidrezakp	yes
2014-05-01 12:36:45	Noxbru	replacing /path/to/archlinux.iso with the path to antergos iso
2014-05-01 12:36:54	Noxbru	and /dev/sdx with your USB
2014-05-01 12:37:09	Noxbru	but BE VERY CAREFUL and use the correct device
2014-05-01 12:37:14	hamidrezakp	 use this but usb flash crached
2014-05-01 12:38:25	Noxbru	that's curious, it has always worked for me
2014-05-01 12:38:54	hamidrezakp	thank you very much for help me.
2014-05-01 12:38:55	Noxbru	and if I recall correctly, it's the 'recomended' way of puting Antergos' iso in a liveUSB
2014-05-01 12:39:05	Noxbru	you are welcome :)
2014-05-01 12:39:41	hamidrezakp	 whats your site or id for find you?
2014-05-01 12:42:09	Noxbru	what do you mean?
2014-05-01 12:42:42	Noxbru	if I am at the IRC then... well, I am here :)
2014-05-01 12:43:13	hamidrezakp	for find you and help for linux
2014-05-01 12:44:17	Noxbru	for finding me, if I am at the IRC I usually answer, for finding help about linux, Arch's wiki is usually very helpful, Arch's forums too, and surely google
2014-05-01 12:44:38	Noxbru	for help with Antergos, then you can try here and the forums

2014-05-06 15:11:39	cor_r	Ok, maybe you can, hi
2014-05-06 15:12:12	cor_r	I am trying to install Antergos but everytime the install stops at "copying xz cache"
2014-05-06 15:12:35	cor_r	no matter which software or DE I choose it keeps stoping there
2014-05-06 15:12:55	cor_r	is it because the iso is still testing? :(
2014-05-06 15:13:55	Noxbru	no, in fact it's the recommended (only as of now) way of installing it
2014-05-06 15:14:14	Noxbru	what testing are you using?
2014-05-06 15:14:52	cor_r	hmm, weird, I installed it not to long ago using xfce as DE and was just reinstalling but now it wont work
2014-05-06 15:15:02	cor_r	the newest for x86_64
2014-05-06 15:15:31	Noxbru	the thing is that the testing image is renewed every sunday, so it changes from week to week
2014-05-06 15:15:44	Noxbru	you mean antergos-2014.05.04-x86_64.iso ?
2014-05-06 15:15:50	cor_r	ah ok, so I might be lucky at sunday?
2014-05-06 15:15:56	cor_r	yes that one
2014-05-06 15:16:02	Noxbru	have you tried using the latest code for cnchi?
2014-05-06 15:16:22	cor_r	I can update cnchi when on live?
2014-05-06 15:16:35	Noxbru	yes, you have to use one script
2014-05-06 15:16:41	Noxbru	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1285 here it is
2014-05-06 15:16:50	Noxbru	look for "Launch Commands"

2014-05-06 15:54:27	cor_r	I already switched the session before and tried loggin in with username:live and password: live as it says by the live cd
2014-05-06 15:54:40	cor_r	couldnt login though, means cant use commands as well

2014-05-08 09:01:24	garrettdreyfus	also why is there x86_64 image on testing?
2014-05-08 09:03:48	Noxbru	november image is very old, and uses and old version of the installer
2014-05-08 09:04:13	Noxbru	the usual 'recommended' way of installing Antergos now is using the testing image
2014-05-08 09:06:13	Noxbru	but, it has a bug
2014-05-08 09:06:15	garrettdreyfus	O.K thank you. The only image I see on testing however is the 1686 image http://mirrors.antergos.com/iso/testing/?C=M;O=A
2014-05-08 09:06:55	Noxbru	whoa, a couple of days ago there was an x86_64
2014-05-08 09:07:05	Noxbru	maybe it has been removed because of this bug
2014-05-08 09:07:33	garrettdreyfus	is there maybe a week old image I could install?
2014-05-08 09:08:04	Noxbru	I'm sorry, but every week the testing images get replaced...
2014-05-08 09:08:29	garrettdreyfus	that's a shame :(
2014-05-08 09:09:04	garrettdreyfus	So no solution but to wait?
2014-05-08 09:09:15	Noxbru	for now it seems so...
2014-05-08 09:10:04	Noxbru	I suggested to other guy to use the november image with the new installer, but I don't know if it worked, sorry
2014-05-08 09:10:24	Noxbru	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1670 this is the bug
2014-05-08 09:12:00	garrettdreyfus	Lol this is the bug I had last week
2014-05-08 09:12:05	garrettdreyfus	glad they took it down
2014-05-08 09:12:08	garrettdreyfus	I was very confused
2014-05-08 09:14:12	sovereignentity	Is Antergos a rolling release?
2014-05-08 09:14:23	Noxbru	seems that yesterday they made new testing images for i686, maybe they will make new for x86_64
2014-05-08 09:15:21	garrettdreyfus	Antergos is at its core arch so yes sovereignentity
2014-05-08 09:15:36	Noxbru	yes, it uses the same Arch's repos
2014-05-08 09:16:10	yunito	I'll install Antergos tomorrow, can you tell me some advice or some programme to install?
2014-05-08 09:16:48	Noxbru	hi, Antergos comes with some prechosen packages, so you should have almost everything needed for a basic use
2014-05-08 09:17:00	Noxbru	unless you need something out of the usual :)
2014-05-08 09:18:36	sovereignentity	garrettdreyfus, in that case this at least 4 month old copy I have will install and upgrade to the newer release
2014-05-08 09:19:16	garrettdreyfus	I have had trouble with the november image. It seems to fail to install grub correctly
2014-05-08 09:19:20	Noxbru	yes, but, the installer is old, and I don't remmember how it was then
2014-05-08 09:19:59	Noxbru	if you want to try, you can upgrade the installer using a script
2014-05-08 09:20:18	Noxbru	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1285 look for "Launch Commands"
2014-05-08 09:20:30	garrettdreyfus	but the newest release doesn't work for me either!
2014-05-08 09:20:59	Noxbru	garrettdreyfus: you mean the image in general or cnchi in particular ?
2014-05-08 09:21:06	garrettdreyfus	cnichi
2014-05-08 09:21:18	garrettdreyfus	*cnchi
2014-05-08 09:21:19	Noxbru	oh
2014-05-08 09:21:24	Noxbru	sorry then...
2014-05-08 09:22:38	garrettdreyfus	nah its fine I'm incredibly excited about antergos and gnome 3.14
2014-05-08 09:23:10	garrettdreyfus	Is there anywhere I could get an older verion? an archive perhaps?
2014-05-08 09:26:37	Noxbru	not that I know, sorry :(
2014-05-08 09:26:45	Noxbru	I'm going to propose it in the forums
2014-05-08 09:28:20	garrettdreyfus	thanks for all the help man! Can't wait to get my hands on it.

2014-05-08 10:38:45	yunito	Noxbru: Is antergos easy to use?
2014-05-08 10:39:06	Noxbru	yunito: yes, I have no problems with it
2014-05-08 10:39:20	yunito	Drivers?
2014-05-08 10:39:25	Noxbru	I have only have one issue related to using arch, and it was solved with an update
2014-05-08 10:39:42	Noxbru	I use 3-years old hardware so no problems for me
2014-05-08 10:40:24	Noxbru	but, as you will have the latest stable kernel and everything you should be fine :)
2014-05-08 10:40:39	Noxbru	but if you are worried about something, maybe there's some info in Arch's wiki
2014-05-08 10:45:09	yunito	I have read that When I have installed Antergos I should install xorg and gnome-network...
2014-05-08 10:45:14	yunito	Is it true?
2014-05-08 10:46:04	Noxbru	as far as I know no
2014-05-08 10:46:50	Noxbru	xorg is a dependence for almost everything graphical (until wayland arrives)
2014-05-08 10:47:07	Noxbru	and gnome-network... well... I don't find any package with that name
2014-05-08 10:47:50	yunito	Oh, another question
2014-05-08 10:48:32	Noxbru	sure, I'll answer it as best as I can
2014-05-08 10:49:02	yunito	When I'am in live mode I can't have internet because I have to blacklist my Network Card to use my USB Network Card, for that reason I can't have internet during SO installation
2014-05-08 10:49:12	yunito	Will it affect to Antergos?
2014-05-08 10:49:33	Noxbru	yes, it is necessary to have internet access to install Antergos
2014-05-08 10:50:59	Noxbru	every package that will be installed has to be downloaded from somewhere, so internet is necessary
2014-05-08 10:51:11	yunito	What Do i have to do in order to blacklist my Network card in live mode?
2014-05-08 10:51:36	yunito	(x64 and x32 Bits Antergos S.O are in the same package?)
2014-05-08 10:53:30	Noxbru	I think that this can help for blacklisting a module https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_modules#Using_kernel_command_line_2
2014-05-08 10:53:55	Noxbru	if you are in the live session, maybe you can just remove it with rmmod
2014-05-08 10:54:35	Noxbru	?
2014-05-08 10:54:53	yunito	I'll try it tomorrow, I hope it works
2014-05-08 10:55:17	yunito	Noxbru where Can I found the x86_x64 Antergos Package?
2014-05-08 10:56:12	Noxbru	Antergos isn't a package, it's a lot of precompiled packages, the iso, the installer...
2014-05-08 10:57:17	yunito	Yeah, I mean that I only see i686 iso
2014-05-08 10:57:31	yunito	I couldn't find the x86_x64 package
2014-05-08 10:57:33	yunito	iso*
2014-05-08 10:57:43	yunito	Is it the same?
2014-05-08 10:57:48	Noxbru	ah, yeah, now there are some problems with the latests isos...
2014-05-08 10:58:12	Noxbru	I'm sorry for that, the devs know about them, and I really hope that they will fix them as soons as possible
2014-05-08 11:00:15	yunito	In that case I couldn't install Antergos until the devs fix them
2014-05-08 11:04:59	Noxbru	I'm afraid that no, sorry :(
2014-05-08 11:05:32	yunito	I hope that new testing iso be released this Sunday
2014-05-08 11:06:12	Noxbru	the 32 bits iso was remade yesterday, so it's possible that they will make a new 64 bits sooner than Sunday, but I don't know
2014-05-08 11:09:50	yunito	But... What problem has occurred?
2014-05-08 11:10:33	Noxbru	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1670 this one

2014-05-08 23:31:11	deewee	Hey guys, quick question. Im installing antergos via usb, with mate for my DE, but the gui install seems to be stuck at `Copying xz files from cache...`
2014-05-08 23:31:26	deewee	Does this operation usually take awhile (so far about 8 minutes)
2014-05-08 23:33:24	deewee	nvm, a bit of research i found a fix, will try

2014-05-09 08:17:59	LanDi	any guess  ?
2014-05-09 08:19:29	Noxbru	can you post the output of pacman -Ss gcc ?
2014-05-09 08:20:14	Noxbru	what pacman is trying to do is update gcc, you have installed gcc-multilib (as I do) but it seems that the newest package that provides gcc is just gcc, and not gcc-multilib
2014-05-09 08:21:00	LanDi	Noxbru, http://pastebin.geany.org/SdQrq/
2014-05-09 08:21:13	LanDi	i see
2014-05-09 08:24:29	Noxbru	Hmmm... interesting... I have the same, but pacman doesn't ask me to upgrade gcc
2014-05-09 08:25:26	Noxbru	I thought that as pacman sees gcc 4.9.0-2 and gcc-multilib 4.9.0-1, it was trying to update from the later to the former, but I am wrong
2014-05-09 08:27:13	LanDi	:(
2014-05-09 08:27:16	LanDi	lol
2014-05-09 08:27:29	Noxbru	can you update pacman alone first?
2014-05-09 08:27:56	LanDi	pacman -S pacman ?
2014-05-09 08:28:03	Noxbru	yes
2014-05-09 08:29:07	Noxbru	https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27214 similar
2014-05-09 08:29:15	LanDi	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
2014-05-09 08:29:21	Noxbru	and if I remember correctly, pacman was updated yesterday
2014-05-09 08:30:49	LanDi	pacman updated but still the issue
2014-05-09 08:31:18	LanDi	I have to go now, try to fix this later
2014-05-09 08:31:25	LanDi	Noxbru, thanks man

2014-05-17 10:34:25	dante123	hi all, I need to rerun grub so that 40_custom entry gets recognized on the boot list....How do I do that from antergos?
2014-05-17 10:35:18	dante123	I have edited 40_custom file in /etc/grub.d but how to I get it to show up on the list?  I figured I need to run update-grub but that fails.
2014-05-17 10:35:29	Noxbru	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Grub#Generating_main_configuration_file
2014-05-17 10:35:35	Noxbru	it's grub-mkconfig
2014-05-17 10:36:35	dante123	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg   <-----???
2014-05-17 10:37:04	Noxbru	should work, yes
2014-05-17 10:37:15	Noxbru	although you will need to run it with sudo
2014-05-17 10:37:23	Noxbru	but if you have doubts, make a backup first
2014-05-17 10:37:31	dante123	I have ubunut, windows 7, and Androidx86 on sda, and then just put antergos on sdb.  But lost the entry for androidx86 after installing antergos
2014-05-17 10:38:25	dante123	so I copied the 40_custom entry from previous grub and pasted it into the 40_custom file under antergos....now want to know how to rerun grub.  Will try grub-mkconfig

2014-05-17 14:47:24	sjors_	Hello, I have installed Antergos x64 today and I love it so far. The only thing I'm having trouble with is installing the nVidia driver for my system. I have one of the dreaded optimus systems (Intel HD + nVidia cards). I have tried multiple guides but they all end up in a blank screen, and some make my fans spin like crazy. Any suggestions?

2014-05-22 01:30:03	Aethysius	Greetings.
2014-05-22 02:16:59	Noxbru	hi
2014-05-22 02:18:42	Aethysius	Did you find that the recent updates screwed things up a bit?
2014-05-22 02:19:01	Noxbru	no, I didn't. Which updates?
2014-05-22 02:19:45	Aethysius	glibc
2014-05-22 02:20:34	Noxbru	2.19-5 I have here
2014-05-22 02:20:43	Aethysius	It messed up my system time and boot drive order, but a few restarts and moments in BIOS fixed it.
2014-05-22 02:20:46	Noxbru	and no problems related to it
2014-05-22 02:21:09	Aethysius	Otherwise, I've been very pleased with Antergos.

2014-05-27 16:18:02	Noxbru	akifp: have you checked that flashplayer is installed, right?
2014-05-27 16:18:04	tarquin88	akifp: use chromium-pepper-flash  on aur

2014-05-27 16:18:57	akifp	how do i use chromium-pepper-flash?
2014-05-27 16:19:41	tarquin88	just install it, then go to chrome://addons , press details and active just a one flashplayer addon
2014-05-27 16:20:34	tarquin88	akifp: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromium-pepper-flash/?setlang=en
2014-05-27 16:22:32	akifp	pacman -S chromium-pepper-flash  returns that the package is not found
2014-05-27 16:22:38	akifp	(sorry, im new to Arch based distros)
2014-05-27 16:23:07	Noxbru	akifp: it's ok, everybody has to learn at some moment :)
2014-05-27 16:23:12	Noxbru	you have to use yaourt
2014-05-27 16:23:29	tarquin88	akifp: you need download the PKGBUILD from link or use yaourt (check if have yaourt on repo) yaourt have acces to User repo called AUR
2014-05-27 16:23:51	Noxbru	tarquin88: yaourt is packed in antergos' repo
2014-05-27 16:24:04	tarquin88	oh damn :( i want to try Antergos >_<
2014-05-27 16:25:04	Noxbru	have you checked the forums? maybe somebody else had the same problem
2014-05-27 16:25:46	tarquin88	akifp: yaourt work on the same way of pacman, but is better use it on normal user and not sudo or root. example: yaourt -S google-chrome
2014-05-27 16:26:06	tarquin88	Noxbru: yes, i see it before, nobody have this issue :(
2014-05-27 16:27:38	akifp	got it working via yaort, thanks guys

2014-05-27 23:20:08	Llewelyn	Evening Antergos folks. I was testing the RC in a VM and I've run into a strange issue. cnchi detects the virtualised install and attempts to configure everything for me however, while the modules are installed and config file is generated to load them at boot the system fails to load the virtualbox guest modules.
2014-05-27 23:23:38	Llewelyn	The files are installed in place; however, the system fails to load them at boot or manually exiting with fatal module not found error.

2014-05-28 10:23:11	c_smith	gonna say this about Antergos: pretty freakin' SWEET! :D
2014-05-28 10:23:26	Jeannie	Just installing it in a VM
2014-05-28 10:23:51	wu_	hey guys my install with the iso downloaded today sems to be hanging while updating the multilib database
2014-05-28 10:23:58	c_smith	Jeannie: I use it for my build system for Android and Chromium OS
2014-05-28 10:24:05	wu_	is there something i can do to figure out what goes wrong?
2014-05-28 10:24:26	c_smith	wu_: I'd say a workaround is commenting out the multilib repo in pacman.conf
2014-05-28 10:24:35	c_smith	only to uncomment it after install.
2014-05-28 10:24:44	Jeannie	I#d like to use it as a daily system on my desktop, read some  very good reviews, thought i'd give it a try
2014-05-28 10:24:50	c_smith	aside from that, I wouldn't know.
2014-05-28 10:25:30	wu_	would that be the live system pacman.conf or is there a chroot going on (using the graphical installer)
2014-05-28 10:25:44	Jeannie	I'm curoious how the MATE DE looks in Antergos actually
2014-05-28 10:26:25	c_smith	Jeannie: it's pretty nice, almost as customizable as Cinnamon without being overly so.
2014-05-28 10:26:45	c_smith	wu_: in the live system BEFORE running pacstrap, as pacstrap copies it from the live system
2014-05-28 10:26:52	Jeannie	I did not find cinnamon  very customizable actually.
2014-05-28 10:27:00	c_smith	*before running the installer
2014-05-28 10:27:08	c_smith	Jeannie: well, without extensions, yes.
2014-05-28 10:27:34	wu_	c_smith: thanks I'll try
2014-05-28 10:27:34	Jeannie	I find cinnamon  slow, unresponsive and crashy actually
2014-05-28 10:27:38	c_smith	but in that sense, Mate is more customizable out of the box.
2014-05-28 10:28:10	c_smith	Jeannie: because Mate is a direct for of Gnome 2, it's quite a bit less resource hungry than Gnome 3.

2014-05-28 10:28:53	Jeannie	I have een using Gnome2/MATE for almost 8 years
2014-05-28 10:28:57	Jeannie	have been even
2014-05-28 10:29:31	c_smith	Jeannie: Mate does a nice job of theming Mate.
2014-05-28 10:29:34	Jeannie	Think that spoilt me for other DEs
2014-05-28 10:29:46	c_smith	course, they had help from Numix
2014-05-28 10:30:08	c_smith	*antergos does a nice job of theming Mate
2014-05-28 10:30:57	Jeannie	Installing takes quite a time as it seems, but that seems to be due to downloading all the MATE stuff, right?
2014-05-28 10:31:27	c_smith	yep, and whatever else you opted to install
2014-05-28 10:31:46	Jeannie	No too much, it's a first try in a VM
2014-05-28 10:32:28	c_smith	just like it's parent, Arch Linux, Antergos downloads everything it will install from the repos, only copying some config files (like pacman.conf and the mirrorlist) from live medium

2014-05-28 10:33:03	Jeannie	If I want to install nvidia non-free drivers on an installed system , do I  install them like in arch?
2014-05-28 10:33:40	c_smith	yes, it's essentially the same framework and system, just with one repo added that has only some themes.
2014-05-28 10:33:51	c_smith	and a few Lightdm packages.
2014-05-28 10:34:00	Jeannie	Would not want to be stuck with nouveau
2014-05-28 10:34:08	c_smith	lol
2014-05-28 10:34:28	c_smith	the Archwiki helps for any topics not covered by the Antergos wiki
2014-05-28 10:34:39	Jeannie	Good to know
2014-05-28 10:34:58	Jeannie	So I'd even be able to use nvidia beta drivers from aur?
2014-05-28 10:35:05	alexsmith	I ran into this issue using memtest off the install media:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/memtest86+/+bug/1071209
2014-05-28 10:35:05	c_smith	probably
2014-05-28 10:35:21	alexsmith	any plans to update memtest to 5 on the install media?
2014-05-28 10:35:32	c_smith	don't have any experience with nvidia, so I can't say for certain.
2014-05-28 10:35:35	Jeannie	Great, can't wait to try out the new 'micrcle driver'
2014-05-28 10:35:41	wu_	c_smith: still hanging at updating the mutlilib database...
2014-05-28 10:35:44	Jeannie	miracle
2014-05-28 10:37:20	c_smith	Jeannie: just be careful, on certain chips, nvidia can be a pain
2014-05-28 10:37:52	Jeannie	Running a GTX 580m non-optimus here
2014-05-28 10:38:21	c_smith	Jeannie: that shouldn't pose a problem then, the main ones with issues are optimus ones.
2014-05-28 10:38:40	Jeannie	I know, that's why I intentionally bought a non-optimus machine

2014-05-28 13:49:24	steven_	is there a special command to install antergos mate
2014-05-28 13:49:55	Celsius	from the *iso?
2014-05-28 13:49:57	steven_	i installed the default gnome but is kinda slow on my netbook
2014-05-28 13:50:09	steven_	did a clean install from usb
2014-05-28 13:50:37	Noxbru	you could try sudo pacman -S mate, but that won't have everything that Antergos adds
2014-05-28 13:50:49	steven_	i would like to test the mate version but without deinstalling gnome
2014-05-28 13:50:59	Noxbru	if you want the full list of packages it is available in github

2014-05-28 13:53:26	steven_	ok and from there i can install the nvidia drivers

2014-05-28 13:54:43	Noxbru	good luck with your nvidia card
2014-05-28 13:54:53	steven_	yea i was playing around with arch , archbang , manjaro
2014-05-28 13:55:12	steven_	manjaro is the easiest one
2014-05-28 13:55:29	Noxbru	really? Antergos is quite easy
2014-05-28 13:56:28	steven_	yes , i mean , manjaro installed nvidia without any problems

2014-05-28 23:14:34	John[Lisbeth]	what's your issue?
2014-05-28 23:14:49	steven_	well i'm in the live usb
2014-05-28 23:15:07	John[Lisbeth]	live usb /= good in arch
2014-05-28 23:15:18	steven_	and if i reboot i get a black screen , can't figur out how to make this work
2014-05-28 23:15:37	steven_	i installed a fresh system , antergos gnome3
2014-05-28 23:15:46	John[Lisbeth]	did you install grub successfully?
2014-05-28 23:16:07	steven_	yes that's the last screen i can see , the grub screen and then all go's black
2014-05-28 23:16:16	steven_	tried nomodeset
2014-05-28 23:16:26	steven_	Ctrl Alt F2
2014-05-28 23:17:12	steven_	it just stays black , i have a nvidia card , is there a way to load the nouveau or nvidia drivers true pacman from the live system to the installed one ?
2014-05-28 23:18:13	steven_	i was reading this article : http://wiki.antergos.com/Preventing+Black+Screen+Issues+on+Lenovo+Y510P+Laptop
2014-05-28 23:18:50	steven_	but this kinda states to reboot after installation and then change stuff , since i can't do anything after reboot this isn't an option
2014-05-28 23:19:45	steven_	i now that the live system uses the nouveau driver
2014-05-28 23:19:49	John[Lisbeth]	have you read this on the arch wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installing_Arch_Linux_on_a_USB_key ?
2014-05-28 23:20:23	steven_	i'm not installing on usb key , it's just my boot medium for installation instead of a cd
2014-05-28 23:21:08	steven_	the usb key works fine cause on my netbook it works without ay issues , so iy's the nvidia card

2014-05-28 23:24:41	steven_	you should make a tutorial on getting this looks
2014-05-28 23:25:48	steven_	John[Lisbeth]: is there a specific kernel option i should add to do this ?
2014-05-28 23:26:02	John[Lisbeth]	do you have a 32 bit or a 64 bit machine?
2014-05-28 23:26:12	steven_	64
2014-05-28 23:26:21	John[Lisbeth]	probably not
2014-05-28 23:26:32	steven_	strange ,
2014-05-28 23:26:41	John[Lisbeth]	keep in mind this channel is usually dead, and you can get alot more help in the arch linux channels or manjaro channels
2014-05-28 23:26:55	John[Lisbeth]	though sometimes people can help you here, and the room is growing as antergos becomes more popular

2014-05-29 04:19:08	Jeannie	Is there a known problem with teh latest installer? I cannot connect to my wireless network with it
2014-05-29 04:19:49	Noxbru	maybe you don't have the right modules loaded?
2014-05-29 04:20:35	Jeannie	I cannot even access teh network settings with the latest live iso
2014-05-29 04:21:25	Jeannie	And carrying my laptop to the cellar to  have a wired network connection sounds quite suboptimal to me
2014-05-29 04:22:22	Noxbru	something similar happened to me, just the other way around: i had wifi (crappy network) and i didn't have wired
2014-05-29 04:22:42	Jeannie	I can't connect to my wifi with Antergos live
2014-05-29 04:23:01	Jeannie	All settings are correct and I can connect with other live systes
2014-05-29 04:23:55	Noxbru	strange then...

2014-05-29 04:24:32	Noxbru	I mean, does it have a field called wlp3s0 or something similar?
2014-05-29 04:25:48	Jeannie	iwconfig?
2014-05-29 04:26:01	Noxbru	yes
2014-05-29 04:26:05	Noxbru	in the terminal
2014-05-29 04:26:38	Jeannie	I would not expect to fiddle around on cli when I want to install from alive system actually
2014-05-29 04:28:30	Jeannie	Well, I'll give it another try will get beck here to inform you aboutthe outcome

2014-06-03 18:40:56	Guest36117	Stupid question - I just installed Antergos, and for some reason my new user doesn't have the pre-set antergos configuration for xfce.  It's missing most of the settings it appears (nothing in lower panel, no themes).  Is there any way to download the default config for a new user?

2014-07-02 15:11:26	Allephe	hello guys
2014-07-02 15:11:31	Allephe	any 1 can help me
2014-07-02 15:11:51	jP_wanN	Allephe: that depends on what your problem is
2014-07-02 15:12:04	Allephe	im trying to install the nvidia drivers
2014-07-02 15:12:17	Allephe	but im having some trouble with mesa conflict
2014-07-02 15:12:32	Allephe	im trying using --nodeps but it is not working
2014-07-02 15:12:49	jP_wanN	what command are you running and what's the error message?
2014-07-02 15:13:21	Allephe	sudo pacman -S nvidia --nodeps
2014-07-02 15:13:49	Allephe	resolving dependencies... looking for inter-conflicts... :: nvidia-libgl and mesa-libgl are in conflict (libgl). Remove mesa-libgl? [y/N] y error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies) :: nouveau-dri: requires mesa-libgl
2014-07-02 15:14:28	jP_wanN	you don't need to add the --nodeps flag (you generally shouldn't use it when you don't really know what you're doing)
2014-07-02 15:14:59	Allephe	im just following a tutorial on antergos wiki
2014-07-02 15:15:47	jP_wanN	the only problem here is that pacman wants to keep nouveau-dri for some reason (other dependencies or manually installed)
2014-07-02 15:16:30	Allephe	yeah
2014-07-02 15:16:40	Allephe	but im not manually installed
2014-07-02 15:16:44	Allephe	its a fresh install
2014-07-02 15:16:54	jP_wanN	you could either remove it first ("pacman -Rns nouveau-dri") or mark it as automatically installed – which may be the better solution because I would assume it to generally be safer
2014-07-02 15:17:54	Allephe	how can i proceed with the safe one
2014-07-02 15:18:29	jP_wanN	I did it just some days before, but I have to search again because I forgot the exact options for pacman...
2014-07-02 15:19:17	Allephe	ok, much appreciated
2014-07-02 15:19:30	Allephe	i have no problems with nouveau, but in full hd stuff
2014-07-02 15:19:45	Allephe	it get some fps drops
2014-07-02 15:19:52	Allephe	something like that
2014-07-02 15:20:19	jP_wanN	well, don't expect the proprietary driver to suck less, but it will be worth a try probably ^^
2014-07-02 15:20:58	jP_wanN	I bought an Intel processor with integrated graphics with my last computer upgrade just because of nvidia issues ^^°
2014-07-02 15:21:33	jP_wanN	okay, so here you go with marking nouveau as not explicity installed:
2014-07-02 15:21:37	jP_wanN	pacman -D --asdeps nouveau-dri
2014-07-02 15:22:06	Allephe	ok
2014-07-02 15:22:07	Allephe	done
2014-07-02 15:22:14	jP_wanN	after that, you can retry "pacman -S nvidia", it should either work or give you a different error message :D
2014-07-02 15:22:39	Allephe	same error ""
2014-07-02 15:22:44	jP_wanN	oh...
2014-07-02 15:23:00	Allephe	nouveau-dri: install reason has been set to 'installed as dependency'
2014-07-02 15:24:30	jP_wanN	well, then try to remove nouveau-dri directly ("pacman -Rns nouveau-dri"), I seriously hope this goes as I expect it too: it should give an error message because of another dependency...
2014-07-02 15:24:39	jP_wanN	s/too/to
2014-07-02 15:26:01	Allephe	it will gave me the error of dependencie
2014-07-02 15:26:09	Allephe	of mesa i think
2014-07-02 15:26:12	Allephe	but lets try
2014-07-02 15:26:17	jP_wanN	wait, what?
2014-07-02 15:26:24	jP_wanN	copy-paste the error please
2014-07-02 15:26:53	Allephe	error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies) :: lib32-nouveau-dri: requires nouveau-dri :: xf86-video-nouveau: requires nouveau-dri
2014-07-02 15:27:56	jP_wanN	well, I don't know enough about pacman to know how to resolve this in an elegant way, but I know it will eventually work when you add all those packages (and maybe packages that appear in further error messages) to the packages to be removed.
2014-07-02 15:29:15	Allephe	thanks anyway man
2014-07-02 15:29:38	jP_wanN	but I have to warn you, have a look at what is going to be removed. if it seems important, better ask again or google for it or whatever.
2014-07-02 15:31:15	jP_wanN	by the way, when you've got package management issues, it doesn't make so much sense to ask in the antergos IRC / antergos wiki. you can ask in channels about arch linux, where much more people will read your questions.
2014-07-02 15:31:27	Allephe	man, i actually got it to work
2014-07-02 15:32:00	Allephe	just used --nodeps --nodeps
2014-07-02 15:32:06	jP_wanN	ugh, what?
2014-07-02 15:32:15	jP_wanN	this is really not good...
2014-07-02 15:32:40	jP_wanN	if the nouveau stuff isn't removed, you might have screwed up parts of your system
2014-07-02 15:33:13	jP_wanN	this is a way worse than the least elegant method I suggested...
2014-07-02 15:33:31	Allephe	hahaha
2014-07-02 15:33:46	Allephe	why they suggest that method in the wiki
2014-07-02 15:33:48	Allephe	http://wiki.antergos.com/nvidia
2014-07-02 15:33:56	jP_wanN	WHAT?
2014-07-02 15:34:39	jP_wanN	wait, but they remove the nouveau-dri package first
2014-07-02 15:34:45	jP_wanN	which didn't work for you
2014-07-02 15:35:31	jP_wanN	I have no clue why you would need to use --nodeps when nouveau-dri isn't installed anymore, but it's certainly not your scenario then
2014-07-02 15:35:38	Allephe	where did u see that
2014-07-02 15:36:00	jP_wanN	http://wiki.antergos.com/nvidia#Installing_nVidia_drivers_via_the_Terminal 8.
2014-07-02 15:37:56	jP_wanN	please, remove nvidia and all that it pulled in with it again ("pacman -Rns nvidia nvidia-utils"), then remove nouveau-dri, xf86-video-nouveau and lib32-nouveau-dri properly and install linux-headers, nvidia and nvidia-utils again
2014-07-02 15:38:55	jP_wanN	your current setup may work, but only until nouveau gets an update.
2014-07-02 15:39:33	Allephe	i do removed nouveau via terminal this time
2014-07-02 15:39:38	Allephe	dont know that goes different
2014-07-02 15:40:08	jP_wanN	if you used PacmanXG before, it shouldn't make a difference
2014-07-02 15:41:11	jP_wanN	can you remove nouveau-dri when removing xf86-video-nouveau and lib32-nouveau-dri simultaneously?

2014-07-03 08:16:48	jgmdev	or checking if somebody reported what you want to say them
2014-07-03 08:31:50	claudiop	I was just looking for someone who can give a few hints on their code. I am reading it, and there are some parts that are eating lots of time, where i just need to know what the do, not to understand them
2014-07-03 08:32:11	claudiop	But its ok, i already have a HUGE diagram of cnchi :)

2014-07-03 09:47:47	hid	hello
2014-07-03 09:48:07	jP_wanN	hello hid
2014-07-03 09:48:23	hid	i'd like to know what is the default display manager
2014-07-03 09:48:59	jP_wanN	hm, it's been a while since I installed my last Antergos, but it should be gdm
2014-07-03 09:49:00	hid	i've just installed antergos with openbox, but this dm is very heavy for my old computer and it always makes it crash
2014-07-03 09:49:34	hid	i looked for gdm everywhere but i did not find it
2014-07-03 09:49:50	jP_wanN	what do you mean with looked for it?
2014-07-03 09:49:52	hid	systemctl |grep dm tells me i have lightdm
2014-07-03 09:49:57	jP_wanN	oh
2014-07-03 09:50:07	jP_wanN	okay, maybe they have changed the default to lightdm
2014-07-03 09:50:18	hid	and systemctl statut does not show me gdm
2014-07-03 09:50:39	hid	but lightdm is very light
2014-07-03 09:50:48	hid	it cant be that imo
2014-07-03 09:51:10	hid	ahhh
2014-07-03 09:51:22	jP_wanN	well, whether lightdm runs fluently and reliably depends on the greeter used I think
2014-07-03 09:52:21	hid	what is a greeter?
2014-07-03 09:53:00	jP_wanN	it's basically what defines the appearance of lightdm
2014-07-03 09:53:05	jP_wanN	of your login screen
2014-07-03 09:53:46	jP_wanN	you could just try out gdm and see if that one works better

2014-07-03 09:57:13	blackwolf12333	I use English (US) but when I try to type a p it shows a *
2014-07-03 09:57:24	jP_wanN	blackwolf12333: I think you should better ask in the Arch Linux Forums
2014-07-03 09:57:39	blackwolf12333	I had arch on this before, worked fine
2014-07-03 09:57:47	jP_wanN	what?
2014-07-03 09:58:06	jP_wanN	Oh you mean you hade a pure arch before and now installed antergos?
2014-07-03 09:58:11	blackwolf12333	ye
2014-07-03 09:58:30	jP_wanN	Okay, you should still ask on the Arch Linux Forums
2014-07-03 09:58:58	blackwolf12333	hmm, okay
2014-07-03 09:59:38	hid	And as i'm new to archlinux, i have some questions
2014-07-03 09:59:41	jP_wanN	this is only a small IRC with most of these 27 people in here being afk probably, so chances aren't so good that someone can help you
2014-07-03 09:59:56	blackwolf12333	it's still weird though, it goes like qwerty456*
2014-07-03 10:00:07	hid	I tried to install mplayer2 via yaourt but there was a compilation problem
2014-07-03 10:00:11	blackwolf12333	there's an archlinux channel here too right?
2014-07-03 10:00:13	Noxbru	blackwolf12333: I think I may know what happens
2014-07-03 10:00:22	Noxbru	does your keyboard has a numerical pad?

2014-07-03 10:00:28	hid	i also tried with the tarball but i still had it
2014-07-03 10:00:31	blackwolf12333	it's a notebook
2014-07-03 10:00:36	blackwolf12333	ah
2014-07-03 10:00:41	blackwolf12333	I see a problem there
2014-07-03 10:00:42	hid	(yaourt -S to solve dependency problems)
2014-07-03 10:01:04	hid	how, generally you can solve these kind of problems?
2014-07-03 10:01:04	Noxbru	maybe you have activated that uio... act like numbers
2014-07-03 10:01:08	blackwolf12333	hid: what's the compilation error?
2014-07-03 10:01:26	jP_wanN	hid: that's also nothing antergos specific, ask in the Arch Linux Forums (or IRC, it shouldn't be too hard to find)

2014-07-09 09:41:02	TheMamboKing42	I was hoping that someone might help me with my new installation of Antergos.

2014-07-09 09:42:00	TheMamboKing42	I used the CLI installer to install the base image of Antergos in a VM for development. I went to /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and activated one of the repository mirrors and saved the changes.
2014-07-09 09:42:20	lunr	hello again!
2014-07-09 09:42:54	TheMamboKing42	When I try to do a sudo pacman -Syyu. I get the download library errors like it is not connecting to any repository databases.
2014-07-09 09:43:45	TheMamboKing42	Any suggestions on how to get everything working right out of the gate with the base installation of Antergos? Am I missing any steps?
2014-07-09 09:46:36	lunr	Using live usb mode
2014-07-09 09:46:41	lunr	my battery percentage has stuck
2014-07-09 09:47:11	lunr	its showing charing: 0:41 Until Full(41%)
2014-07-09 09:47:16	lunr	if I remove the charger no change
2014-07-09 09:47:26	lunr	if I reconnect, still remains the same
2014-07-09 09:47:41	lunr	using Upower --monitor-all, its also showing the same 41% charging
2014-07-09 09:47:50	lunr	acpi also reports charging 41%
2014-07-09 09:47:52	lunr	:(
2014-07-09 09:50:13	TheMamboKing42	Sounds like your actual battery is nearing end of life or may be defective
2014-07-09 09:50:27	TheMamboKing42	I have a similar situation on one of my old laptops.
2014-07-09 09:50:45	TheMamboKing42	It will still run, but you will never get a full charge that lasts. Laptop becomes desktop lol.
2014-07-09 09:51:47	lunr	no, you don't understand
2014-07-09 09:52:07	lunr	when I reboot it changes to new status but stays stuck there
2014-07-09 09:52:26	lunr	to check what is what I booted into windows and its updating charging/discharging nicely
2014-07-09 09:52:49	lunr	but when I reboot to antergos, it stays stuck at the latest charging/discharging percentage
2014-07-09 09:53:08	lunr	my battery is fine
2014-07-09 09:53:36	TheMamboKing42	STrange
2014-07-09 09:53:43	lunr	I googled a bit and there are reports of this being bug with xfcw and cinnamon battery applet but no fix, on the other hand antergos is using gnome
2014-07-09 09:53:55	lunr	interestingly I also have elementaryos
2014-07-09 09:54:02	lunr	that one shows the charging/discharging properly
2014-07-09 09:54:03	lunr	:(
2014-07-09 09:54:49	lunr	BTW, I ran the sudo pacman -Syyu in terminal and it worked fine for me
2014-07-09 09:55:46	lunr	I am not familiar with VM, but sometimes their 'virtual' network driver thingy gets stuck
2014-07-09 09:56:10	lunr	I have some virtualbox ethernet stuff disabled
2014-07-09 09:56:11	lunr	:)
2014-07-09 09:57:15	TheMamboKing42	What do you have disabled on a base install of antergos on virtualbox/
2014-07-09 09:57:29	lunr	?
2014-07-09 09:57:39	lunr	I didn't install antergos on virtualbox
2014-07-09 09:57:49	TheMamboKing42	Ahh
2014-07-09 09:57:54	lunr	I use virtualbox for android development stuff, Genymotion
2014-07-09 09:57:55	lunr	^
2014-07-09 09:58:20	lunr	ok, terminal suggesting net upgrade size 1.30MiB
2014-07-09 09:58:26	lunr	total download 190.0MiB
2014-07-09 09:58:34	lunr	after running pacman -Syyu
2014-07-09 10:00:16	lunr	this is confusing
2014-07-09 10:00:21	lunr	battery stuck like that
2014-07-09 10:00:38	lunr	I had that once in fedora live
2014-07-09 10:00:44	lunr	but got fixed after reboot
2014-07-09 10:11:13	sinix	TheMamboKing42: you're saying you ran pacman -Syu and it didn't work?

2014-07-09 10:24:23	TheMamboKing42	I will try uncommenting more mirrors and pinging some stuff
2014-07-09 10:25:13	sinix	ive never done an antergos "minimal" install - idk how minimal it is, or whether it's just "everything except a DE"
2014-07-09 10:25:49	sinix	lunr did you sort out your battery problem?
2014-07-09 10:25:54	sinix	what DE are you in?
2014-07-09 10:26:20	lunr	no, my battery indicator is white which means its >90% now

2014-07-09 10:27:23	lunr	its like somehow the applet crashed or something
2014-07-09 10:28:37	sinix	yeah - and I'm not sure where all that stuff is in Gnome
2014-07-09 10:28:48	lunr	oh ok
2014-07-09 10:28:54	lunr	if you don't mind me asking

2014-07-09 10:31:15	lunr	I tried "ping 8.8.8.8"
2014-07-09 10:31:17	lunr	its stuck

2014-07-09 10:31:40	lunr	I get some name and addresses
2014-07-09 10:31:45	sinix	if you can't ping google then you're just not internet conencted - you can try the internet setup instructions in the arch beginners guide
2014-07-09 10:32:09	sinix	but in a vbox it should be automagic
2014-07-09 10:32:47	sinix	lunr: i don't really know gnome, i'd recommend jumping into their IRC and see if anyone there can help

2014-07-10 13:00:36	mulch	new to Antergos and Arch... so far incredibly impressed. Using Gnome.
2014-07-10 13:01:33	mulch	Any ideas on why custom keyboard shortcuts are taking 10 seconds or so to launch their respective programs?
2014-07-10 13:09:03	sinix_	gnome can be resource-intensive - how are the computer's specs?
2014-07-10 13:13:59	mulch	Specs are good... I'm sure it's not that. All other apps launch incredibly fast. There seems to be a problem with the way that the gui is creating the shortcuts
2014-07-10 13:14:28	mulch	SPECS: 8 GB memory, SSD...
2014-07-10 13:20:13	mulch	I'm left to simply think it's a bug...
2014-07-10 13:20:27	mulch	Also, I should note that I'm using Antergos, not vanilla Arch
2014-07-10 13:20:45	mulch	Do you think that could be the issue?
2014-07-10 13:23:54	sinix_	sorry, work people keep making me do work - i doubt it's anything to do with antergos, as the gnome in antergos is pulled from the arch repo (I think!), so maybe it has to do with the method of assigning the hotkeys?

2014-07-10 13:24:20	sinix_	what are you using to create the hotkeys?
2014-07-10 13:25:59	sinix_	(also, I don't really use gnome, and #antergos is usually pretty quiet, might be worth checking out irc.gnome.org #gnome
2014-07-10 13:26:16	-->	dmnmsc (~quassel@55.Red-88-7-96.staticIP.rima-tde.net) has joined #antergos
2014-07-10 13:30:32	mulch	Thanks for the help.. I'm using the Gnome keyboard shortcut GUI in the settings area to create the hotkeys.
2014-07-10 13:32:35	mulch	Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts
2014-07-10 13:33:13	mulch	But here's the interesting thing... even for pre-defined shortcuts that I've modified I'm having the same problem.
2014-07-10 13:33:46	mulch	And by "pre-defined" I mean the ones found in the "Launchers" section of the GUI
2014-07-10 13:34:34	mulch	Overall I'm loving the switch... but it's a bit crazy to me to not have a quick way to access the terminal :(
2014-07-10 13:45:27	sinix_	mod4 + termi + enter ;)
2014-07-10 13:45:57	sinix_	but you're saying - the predefined ones are instant, but when you modify them, they go slow?
2014-07-10 13:46:02	sinix_	that's super weird
2014-07-10 13:46:29	dmnmsc	mulch: you can use bindkeys for keyboard shortcuts
2014-07-10 13:46:39	mulch	Here's a thread I found describing my exact behavior: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=180075
2014-07-10 13:46:40	dmnmsc	I'm using strg+alt+t for terminal
2014-07-10 13:46:45	mulch	thanks :)
2014-07-10 13:46:54	mulch	srtg?
2014-07-10 13:46:55	dmnmsc	xbindkeys, sorry *
2014-07-10 13:47:01	dmnmsc	ctrl
2014-07-10 13:47:35	mulch	Yeah... I suppose it xbingkeys might be a more robust route
2014-07-10 13:47:55	mulch	but it's *so* easy to set them in the native Gnome GUI !
2014-07-10 13:48:50	mulch	sinix: can you explain the "mod4 + termi" portion that you use... I'm a relative noob :)
2014-07-10 13:49:04	dmnmsc	I'm using cinnamon and I have no issue with keyboard shortcuts created with it own tool
2014-07-10 13:50:01	 *	dmnmsc hates this keyboard....
2014-07-10 13:50:02	sinix_	sorry, that was a joke - mod4 is the button also known as the windows key, "termi" just means the first 5 letters of "terminal" so you hit mod4, type "termi", and then press enter
2014-07-10 13:51:06	mulch	got it :)  More of a "quick launch" approach
2014-07-10 13:51:22	sinix_	yeah exaclty - when I use typical DEs, that's how i launch stuff
2014-07-10 13:51:25	mulch	seems small, but I find a simple keybinding *much* faster
2014-07-10 13:51:41	sinix_	at work, terminal is just Mod4+enter
2014-07-10 13:51:44	mulch	yes, for most apps I do too... but for the *terminal*
2014-07-10 13:52:12	mulch	how do you get Mod4+enter to launch the terminal?
2014-07-10 13:52:24	sinix_	awesome WM!
2014-07-10 13:52:39	mulch	:)
2014-07-10 13:52:40	sinix_	that's what i use at work
2014-07-10 13:52:50	mulch	That's the actual name?
2014-07-10 13:52:55	sinix_	yeah
2014-07-10 13:52:58	sinix_	awesomeWM soemtimes
2014-07-10 13:53:11	sinix_	awesome.naquadah.org
2014-07-10 13:53:13	mulch	ahhhhh... right, I've read about this guy in blog post somewhere.
2014-07-10 13:53:22	sinix_	it's super keyboard-friendly
2014-07-10 13:53:36	mulch	sweet :)  and I love the photo on that page :)
2014-07-10 13:54:24	mulch	super-noob question: is it possible to use something like awesome WM inside of Gnome?
2014-07-10 13:54:58	sinix_	yeah, that's kinda insane, but it gets the use-case for awesomeWM pretty well - lots of stuff at once, lots of terminals, etc
2014-07-10 13:55:01	sinix_	yes and no
2014-07-10 13:55:30	sinix_	someone tried to add a tiling element to gnome, and it seems like it went well, but then that person stopped developing it and now it doesn't work
2014-07-10 13:55:49	sinix_	pytile is the keyword you can google for more info
2014-07-10 13:56:28	mulch	thanks
2014-07-10 13:56:57	mulch	I've found this Gnome extension for window moving https://github.com/negesti/gnome-shell-extensions-negesti
2014-07-10 13:57:45	mulch	it's was one of the primary reasons I wanted to go with Gnome... and generally the extension resource as a whole

2014-07-10 13:59:47	mulch	sinix: what Distro / other related stuff would one need to use for a awesome WM setup?
2014-07-10 14:00:38	mulch	Would you recommend the trouble, or suggest just sticking with vanilla Antergos/Gnome and making do?
2014-07-10 14:03:11	sinix_	you don't need anything special, just pacman -S awesome
2014-07-10 14:03:36	sinix_	then log out, and it'll be in your DE options in the display manager login thingy
2014-07-10 14:04:02	mulch	wow... I had no idea it was that easy.
2014-07-10 14:04:29	sinix_	i use a few ricer terminal apps to make put more stuff in terminals, like ranger, feh, and ncmpcpp
2014-07-10 14:04:38	mulch	and this would replace the *entire* desktop experience, so to speak, correct?
2014-07-10 14:04:44	sinix_	BECAUSE RICE 4 LYFE
2014-07-10 14:04:57	sinix_	yeah, i mean, not REPLACE, just switch
2014-07-10 14:05:04	sinix_	you can go abck to gnome at any time
2014-07-10 14:05:36	sinix_	but yeah - there are a few fudamnetal things taht aren't there that you might be expecting
2014-07-10 14:06:08	sinix_	almost everything has to be configured - there's no volume thingy in the system tray, or battery monitor
2014-07-10 14:06:33	sinix_	wifi
2014-07-10 14:06:35	sinix_	etc
2014-07-10 14:07:11	sinix_	what i did is intall awesome, play with it every now and then, until i stopped going back to cinnamon
2014-07-10 14:07:40	mulch	cool
2014-07-10 14:08:03	sinix_	its easy to install, but it can take some getting used to :)
2014-07-10 14:09:18	mulch	like most of linux :)   But I'm finding it's incredibly worth it.
2014-07-10 14:09:54	sinix_	yeah exactly - that actually describes my linux switch too - play with it for longer and longer durations until i just stop booting windows
2014-07-10 14:11:01	mulch	scratch that... most of linux isn't easy to install. meant to say that my entry into linux has been very easy - Ubuntu :(   But then I became frustrated with bugs and such and started exploring other options. Now I'm here at Fedora, only I entered through Antergos. I had tried Elementary OS before, only to get tired of waiting for their next big update.
2014-07-10 14:12:56	sinix_	yeah i like the rolling release thing a lot
2014-07-10 14:13:33	sinix_	as for installation difficulties, it's all relative :)  but i'd say that antergos & ubuntu installation is about as easy as windows 8
2014-07-10 14:13:45	sinix_	and definitely a lot easier than OSX
2014-07-10 14:14:33	mulch	agreed.
2014-07-10 14:15:25	mulch	Just came across this site on the best linux windows managers (should it be of any help to you all, though you're likely all pros:) - http://www.slant.co/topics/390/~what-is-the-best-window-manager-for-linux
2014-07-10 14:17:53	sinix_	that's actually a realy good resource
2014-07-10 14:18:29	sinix_	its got some good obscure ones
2014-07-10 14:19:29	sinix_	little weird that they've got enlightenment and openbox but not KDE and gnome etc
2014-07-10 14:21:12	mulch	Yeah, quite a nice design/ui too
2014-07-10 14:21:34	mulch	Can awesomeWM make a window "sticky" to always remain on top of others?
2014-07-10 14:27:39	mulch	gotta go... thanks again for all the input, will soon checkout Awesome :)

2014-07-25 02:54:51	Noxbru	if not, then the forums
2014-07-25 02:56:54	JustinZ`	Mmm
2014-07-25 02:57:07	JustinZ`	I'd love to see Pantheon offered on Antergos as a desktop during install.

2014-07-25 03:02:31	Noxbru	I think that Pantheon has already been proposed/sugested/asked for, but I don't know if they are doing anything towards it
2014-07-25 03:02:38	Noxbru	is it in Arch's oficial repos?
2014-07-25 03:03:02	JustinZ`	It's in the AUR
2014-07-25 03:03:03	JustinZ`	I think
2014-07-25 03:03:07	JustinZ`	I'm new-ish to Arch :)
2014-07-25 03:05:37	Noxbru	then it's hard...
2014-07-25 03:08:04	JustinZ`	Hmm
2014-07-25 03:08:22	JustinZ`	Maybe I can just remix my own arch iso
2014-07-25 03:09:50	Noxbru	you can still install a base system and add pantheon over it
2014-07-25 03:10:03	Noxbru	I did it when kde wasn't offered

2014-07-26 14:56:31	dmnmsc	mi experiencia en Manjaro fue horrible, pero en Antergos va de lujo. Le da mil patadas a gnome-shell en cuanto a rendimiento
2014-07-26 14:57:11	msx	coincido
2014-07-26 14:57:33	msx	manjaro la probé una vez, nunca me gustó, desde la estética horrible hasta las herramientas propias

2014-07-27 01:53:58	devil__	but I found out by now, you can add their repo
2014-07-27 01:54:24	devil__	not very familiar with arch or it's derivates

2014-07-27 01:57:54	JustinZ`	last commit was January
2014-07-27 01:58:22	devil__	JustinZ`: acording to plfiorini there is new packages in arch as of june or so
2014-07-27 01:58:50	JustinZ`	i'm just reading off their github repo
2014-07-27 01:59:25	devil__	[18:17:58] <devil__> is there any releses planned for the next 3 weeks that I shoukld mention/wait for?
2014-07-27 01:59:27	devil__	[20:27:34] <plfiorini> devil__, released tarballs were updated this week
2014-07-27 01:59:39	JustinZ`	fair enough
2014-07-27 02:00:22	devil__	just trying in vbox, but i guess that will fail due to wayland
2014-07-27 02:01:27	devil__	JustinZ`: next on my list to cover with an article is budgie/evolve, where you hang out as well :)
2014-07-27 02:01:39	JustinZ`	heh sure do
2014-07-27 02:01:47	JustinZ`	someones gotta harass ikey to get things done
2014-07-27 02:02:01	JustinZ`	Yeah I found this http://archive.maui-project.org/archlinux/hawaii/os/x86_64/ arch repo for hawaii
2014-07-27 02:02:10	JustinZ`	odd that the github doesn't match
2014-07-27 02:02:27	devil__	he is quite active, compared to maui/hawaii
2014-07-27 02:02:51	devil__	but first I have to crack that
2014-07-27 02:02:55	JustinZ`	hes dedicated and hard working i'll say that
2014-07-27 02:03:08	JustinZ`	hes also VERY open to influence
2014-07-27 02:03:26	JustinZ`	which is great as I'm helping him shape it (without actually having any coding knowledge) :D
2014-07-27 02:03:33	devil__	well, then I will try to push evolve towards debian :P
2014-07-27 02:03:41	JustinZ`	hawaii does look very similar to budgie
2014-07-27 02:03:48	devil__	in a way, yes
2014-07-27 02:03:49	JustinZ`	he'll never re-base to debian
2014-07-27 02:03:55	devil__	I know :9
2014-07-27 02:03:57	JustinZ`	but you can use the PPA to run budgie on debian
2014-07-27 02:04:17	JustinZ`	and hes recently been working towards budgie becoming a very multi-distro DE
2014-07-27 02:04:24	devil__	I never add ppa's to debian, I do not need a frankendebian
2014-07-27 02:04:33	JustinZ`	its working on arch and debian/ubuntu already
2014-07-27 02:04:36	JustinZ`	and i think opensus
2014-07-27 02:04:37	JustinZ`	e*
2014-07-27 02:05:25	JustinZ`	good thing about ikey is hes VERY focussed on upstream so he'd never put common packages into the PPA, rather rely on upstream to provide them
2014-07-27 02:05:37	Aethysius	Huh, never heard of Hawaii DE.
2014-07-27 02:10:25	devil__	Aethysius: you could add their repo to pacman.conf: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hawaii
2014-07-27 02:10:43	Aethysius	Thanks!

2014-07-27 02:36:43	JustinZ`	Thats odd then.
2014-07-27 02:36:47	devil__	I guess I have to shrink a partition and do a real install
2014-07-27 02:36:59	JustinZ`	What size did you make the vb hdd?
2014-07-27 02:37:07	devil__	8 GB
2014-07-27 02:37:17	JustinZ`	that should be enough.
2014-07-27 02:37:27	JustinZ`	i'd recreate the hdd and try again
2014-07-27 02:37:40	JustinZ`	actually I HAVE got antergos in a vbox vm before
2014-07-27 02:37:43	JustinZ`	so it does wokr

2014-07-31 01:39:28	anotherAntergos	Hi
2014-07-31 01:39:58	Noxbru	hi anotherAntergos
2014-07-31 01:40:02	anotherAntergos	i got a short problem, everytime i try to install kde, it tells me on a certain point "cant install the packages" but every other install option works fine
2014-07-31 01:41:01	Noxbru	you mean with cnchi?
2014-07-31 01:41:16	anotherAntergos	yep, well there are other install options?
2014-07-31 01:41:33	Noxbru	not really, I was just making sure
2014-07-31 01:41:43	Noxbru	have you tried using the latest development version for cnchi?
2014-07-31 01:42:16	Noxbru	not the one that comes with the iso, but the one from github
2014-07-31 01:42:17	anotherAntergos	ok, the curious thing about it is, i installed from teh same stick kde on my other notebook
2014-07-31 01:42:27	anotherAntergos	how would i do that noxbru?
2014-07-31 01:46:13	Noxbru	when did you install kde? maybe the packages changed in the Arch repos and cnchi is having problems finding them

2014-07-31 01:46:28	anotherAntergos_	hm
2014-07-31 01:46:47	Noxbru	to use the latest dev version, you will need to boot the iso, and when cnchi starts you have to close it

2014-07-31 01:46:59	Noxbru	then, Alt+F2 and 'cnchi-dev'
2014-07-31 01:47:15	Noxbru	that should grab the latest version from github
2014-07-31 01:47:25	Noxbru	(you can also launch it from the terminal)
2014-07-31 01:48:29	anotherAntergos_	ok the message came up, : updating cnchi with the lates version.. lets see
2014-07-31 01:49:02	anotherAntergos_	now i just have to wait?
2014-07-31 01:49:08	Noxbru	yep
2014-07-31 01:50:30	anotherAntergos_	i guessw this will take some time :)
2014-07-31 01:50:48	Noxbru	don't know... I did it once in a VM, it depends on your connection
2014-07-31 01:51:12	anotherAntergos_	when do i know its finished?
2014-07-31 01:51:16	Noxbru	I think that it's better to do it from a terminal, though, to see if something goes wrong
2014-07-31 01:51:23	Noxbru	it launches cnchi again
2014-07-31 01:51:43	anotherAntergos_	ok
2014-07-31 01:51:59	anotherAntergos_	thx so far
2014-07-31 01:52:42	Noxbru	you are welcome
2014-07-31 01:55:15	Elisse	how can I install gnome and kde on antergos I have xfce as default and only DM
2014-07-31 01:55:40	Elisse	when I installed antergos I choose xfce
2014-07-31 01:55:56	Noxbru	Elisse: the easy way would be something like 'pacman -S gnome kde'

2014-07-31 01:56:18	Noxbru	but you'd better look at Arch's wiki for the gnome and kde pages
2014-07-31 01:56:41	Elisse	ok
2014-07-31 01:57:02	Noxbru	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gnome#Installation this for gnome
2014-07-31 01:57:18	Noxbru	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kde#KDE_4.x this for kde
2014-07-31 01:57:53	Elisse	ok I will read
2014-07-31 01:57:59	Noxbru	remember to check what packages it is going to install, and everything. Maybe you don't need some of them
2014-07-31 01:58:16	Elisse	ok
2014-07-31 01:58:53	Noxbru	for example: 'gnome' is a group and it installs totem, maybe you don't want it
2014-07-31 01:59:13	Elisse	ok

2014-07-31 02:29:43	anotherAntergos	strange, the cnchi-dev deletes the antergos mirrorlist o.O
2014-07-31 02:30:02	Noxbru	I know, I have just checked the script

2014-07-31 02:32:46	Noxbru	okay, we still have options (of course we have!)
2014-07-31 02:33:05	anotherAntergos	well i restarted with no cnchi-dev runned
2014-07-31 02:34:08	Noxbru	so... now you are in a fresh system without having run cnchi-dev or changed the mirrorlist?
2014-07-31 02:34:14	anotherAntergos	yep
2014-07-31 02:34:25	anotherAntergos	the mirrorlist is the same you posted :)
2014-07-31 02:35:00	Noxbru	yep, the problem is that cnchi-dev tries to update it, but as in your case it can't it replaces it with an empty file
2014-07-31 02:35:34	Noxbru	ok, go to /usr/share/cnchi/scripts (if I remember correctly)
2014-07-31 02:35:59	anotherAntergos	i am there
2014-07-31 02:36:05	Noxbru	there's a file called testing.sh
2014-07-31 02:36:26	anotherAntergos	yep
2014-07-31 02:36:40	Noxbru	edit it and remove this line 'cp /tmp/antergos-mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/'
2014-07-31 02:36:46	Noxbru	or comment it
2014-07-31 02:37:23	Noxbru	it will still complain about not finding a new mirrorlist, but it won't squash the one you have
2014-07-31 02:37:48	Noxbru	now just run cnchi-dev
2014-07-31 02:40:43	anotherAntergos	now its cloning
2014-07-31 02:40:54	Noxbru	that's good :)
2014-07-31 02:43:37	anotherAntergos	ok started cnchi
2014-07-31 02:43:42	anotherAntergos	i give it a try :)
2014-07-31 02:43:55	Noxbru	cross your fingers
2014-07-31 02:45:31	anotherAntergos	install runs lets see, thx for the massive help already :)
2014-07-31 02:46:14	anotherAntergos	but the question is then why is antergos.info important for the installer update?

2014-07-31 06:31:28	satshow	me to
2014-07-31 06:32:52	speckmade	well - actually not even that is true: I fail to verify integrity for the installer .iso
2014-07-31 06:33:28	satshow	I have a problem with dual boot and windows 8
2014-07-31 06:33:51	juliohm	speckmade, what instructions are you following to check integrity?
2014-07-31 06:33:53	speckmade	I never touched Win8
2014-07-31 06:34:03	juliohm	neither do I
2014-07-31 06:34:30	juliohm	For me, windows is far in the past
2014-07-31 06:35:06	satshow	it's on my new computer. I don't use windows but I will keep it
2014-07-31 06:35:38	juliohm	satshow, I refuse to use something that comes by brute force
2014-07-31 06:35:39	speckmade	juliohm: Is there any? - That would certainly be a starting point...
2014-07-31 06:35:48	juliohm	you should ask for restitution of your money
2014-07-31 06:36:10	juliohm	speckmade, you have to check if there is some Antergos md5sum out there
2014-07-31 06:36:11	satshow	it is on my asus computer juliohm
2014-07-31 06:36:30	juliohm	satshow, you buy the computer and it came with Windows, correct?
2014-07-31 06:36:36	juliohm	if you won't use the OS
2014-07-31 06:36:37	satshow	yes
2014-07-31 06:36:46	juliohm	you should deny the license terms and ask for the money
2014-07-31 06:36:56	speckmade	satshow: I did dualboot often enough - but only with BIOS-based systems so far.
2014-07-31 06:36:57	juliohm	it's against the law to sell two products together
2014-07-31 06:37:13	juliohm	and people insist the sell Windows by brute force
2014-07-31 06:37:21	juliohm	you want the hardware, not the OS
2014-07-31 06:37:38	juliohm	however, if you already accepted the Windows license, sorry, nothing you can do
2014-07-31 06:37:43	satshow	I have now a dual boot with linux mint and that works good the installer, have a grub where I can choose
2014-07-31 06:39:11	speckmade	juliohm: I don't see any use in a MD5 sum that comes over untrustable connection
2014-07-31 06:39:32	juliohm	speckmade, untrustable connection?
2014-07-31 06:39:46	juliohm	you have to look in Antergos website
2014-07-31 06:39:53	juliohm	if they provide a md5sum, you're done
2014-07-31 06:39:55	speckmade	juliohm: There's not even HTTPS available
2014-07-31 06:39:59	juliohm	I did not check the integrity here
2014-07-31 06:40:15	juliohm	then install it and see if all is okay
2014-07-31 06:40:43	satshow	I have just try the installer, can choose where I wil have the root but I don't know which I must choose for the efi bootloader
2014-07-31 06:40:47	juliohm	I never experienced integrity issues during my hole life as a Linux user
2014-07-31 06:40:52	juliohm	whole*
2014-07-31 06:41:03	speckmade	juliohm: I don't only want to check for transmission errors but also whether some NSA gives me an altered .iso
2014-07-31 06:41:09	juliohm	satshow, if you want custom install paths, set manual install
2014-07-31 06:41:28	juliohm	speckmade, I don't know how to check that, sorry
2014-07-31 06:41:37	speckmade	juliohm: Because it's also security issues that brought me to Linux.
2014-07-31 06:42:21	speckmade	satshow: EFI... :-/
2014-07-31 06:42:47	speckmade	satshow: That's too futuristic for me, still...
2014-07-31 06:42:58	satshow	yes I know
2014-07-31 06:45:50	speckmade	satshow: I usually install GRUB to MBR because it takes care of Windows, too.
2014-07-31 06:46:40	satshow	speckmade: my bios is EUFI
2014-07-31 06:47:15	speckmade	satshow: Does that have to do with the bootloader?
2014-07-31 06:47:37	satshow	so far I know wel
2014-07-31 06:49:02	satshow	I must change to legacy in my bios. When I do that I can install other distros but I can't see windows inside linux

2014-08-01 08:15:40	nikorockz	I just downloaded antergos 64bit and tried to install using usb in uefi .
2014-08-01 08:16:20	nikorockz	the menu appears but when I select boot live antergos only blank screen any suggestions?
2014-08-01 08:17:03	sinix	what are you putting it on?
2014-08-01 08:17:10	sinix	sounds like a laptop backlighting problem
2014-08-01 08:17:42	nikorockz	its a vaio laptop I can see screen light but nothing is shown
2014-08-01 08:18:15	sinix	what year/make/model?
2014-08-01 08:19:35	nikorockz	SONY VAIO SVF14213SAB
2014-08-01 08:20:37	nikorockz	I installed arch linux before and it installed fine in uefi mode .
2014-08-01 08:22:16	sinix	when you installed arch, you got to a desktop environment?
2014-08-01 08:23:01	nikorockz	I build arch from scratch.
2014-08-01 08:24:00	sinix	yeah, i mean, when you built it, you finished it?  did you install a DE and it worked?
2014-08-01 08:24:41	nikorockz	yes I used all type of DE's and everything worked fine.
2014-08-01 08:26:05	sinix	did you try booting antergos in legacy instead of uefi?
2014-08-01 08:27:02	nikorockz	no
2014-08-01 08:28:20	sinix	its been a while since ive used it, but i thought i remembered the installer, cnchi, having uefi problems - try legacy, or see if you can boot a different arch-based installer, like archbang or somthing
2014-08-01 08:28:49	nikorockz	ok will try .

2014-08-01 08:39:49	nikorockz	Is there any work around for antergos to boot in uefi?
2014-08-01 08:45:25	nikorockz	So far this is a great Arch linux based distro I used so far.
2014-08-01 08:47:03	sinix	yeah i love antergos too... honestly, I don;t know enough about uefi to know what to do - i googled a little just now and saw some bugs and fixes discussed about cnchi, but if you can't even boot do a DE on the live media...
2014-08-01 08:47:21	sinix	hey - when it's booting, can you alt-F2 to get to another tty?
2014-08-01 08:47:49	sinix	or, sorry, when it's failing to boot - when it's black screened or whatever
2014-08-01 08:48:05	sinix	if you can get to a command line, you have more options
2014-08-01 08:48:20	nikorockz	Wish this problem to be fixed soon.
2014-08-01 08:49:04	nikorockz	I will check once more on command line .Thanks for the help.

2014-08-01 13:30:20	sinix	No savings account, or even investment, will return more than the interest you're paying on your debt - unless you've got millions of dollars, in which case, you don't need this LPT.  What this means is, the money that you saved could've gone to paying off the debt, but instead, you're getting a low interest rate on it, and paying higher principle on your debt.

2014-08-02 09:53:47	black-death	ok
2014-08-02 09:54:28	Noxbru	there doesn't seem to be a xfce 4.11 yet
2014-08-02 09:54:32	Noxbru	not even in their web
2014-08-02 09:55:37	black-death	There are a distributions are then used files of this version 4.11
2014-08-02 09:56:04	black-death	its manjaro
2014-08-02 09:56:22	Noxbru	what?
2014-08-02 09:57:10	black-death	manjaro used xfce 4.11 How this

2014-08-02 10:00:05	Noxbru	I don't know, according to Xfce website, the latest stable is 4.10: http://www.xfce.org/download
2014-08-02 10:02:02	Noxbru	Hmm....
2014-08-02 10:02:12	Noxbru	seems that only even numbers are stable
2014-08-02 10:02:21	Noxbru	so 4.11 is an unstable/development version
2014-08-02 10:04:08	black-death	In our XFCE edition we added more XFCE 4.11 
2014-08-02 10:04:18	black-death	http://manjaro.org/2014/02/23/manjaro-0-8-9-hit-our-servers/
2014-08-02 10:04:51	black-death	How did this
2014-08-02 10:07:01	Noxbru	what do you mean?
2014-08-02 10:08:12	black-death	How he got to this version I want to use the same version of xfce 4.11
2014-08-02 10:09:18	black-death	I apologize for my English is weak
2014-08-02 10:10:05	Noxbru	ok... well, you can try to find an unofficial repo that has xfce 4.11
2014-08-02 10:10:29	Noxbru	you can try to find xfce 4.11 in the aur (I'm looking for it but I can't find it)
2014-08-02 10:10:40	black-death	ok thx

2014-08-02 10:21:26	MichaelTunnell	unstable packages is dangerous especially for a DE so hope that doesnt blow up in his face
2014-08-02 10:21:56	Noxbru	I agree, but he seemed to want it
2014-08-02 10:22:33	Noxbru	as far as I see, there's no unofficial xfce repo
2014-08-02 10:24:00	MichaelTunnell	btw in the future if someone does ask about xnoise and lyrics it does support them but is limited in how much support. I think it only allows lyrics from one database but I cant find which database
2014-08-02 10:24:30	Noxbru	sure, I'll remember :)
2014-08-02 10:24:45	Noxbru	btw, xnoise seems to have stopped developing
2014-08-02 10:36:01	MichaelTunnell	yea I think xnoise was made by the elementary team
2014-08-02 10:37:13	MichaelTunnell	it needs to be removed from the antergos installer now since it is dead
2014-08-02 10:37:27	Noxbru	yes, as it was hotot

2014-08-02 10:40:17	Noxbru	that's why I said 'was'
2014-08-02 10:41:04	Noxbru	but it has to be substituted... in which desktops is still used?

2014-08-02 10:46:52	MichaelTunnell	I dont know where xnoise is entirely but I know GNOME and XFCE have it
2014-08-02 10:47:28	Noxbru	gnome could use rythmbox, maybe... and I don't know about XFCE
2014-08-02 10:48:04	MichaelTunnell	xfce could use rythmbox as well...it is surprisingly lighter than you'd expect
2014-08-02 10:48:37	MichaelTunnell	though GNOME Music could be the only thing installed as well
2014-08-02 10:48:59	Noxbru	I don't know... I used to use rythmbox but changed it for clementine
2014-08-02 10:50:22	MichaelTunnell	I don't think there is a music player that solves all the issues for a music player so no matter what player is chosen it will probably be replaced by a high percentage
2014-08-02 10:51:33	Noxbru	yeah, we all have our preferences, and given how easy is to just install the one we like...
2014-08-02 10:51:44	Noxbru	now we only need one dev to change the installed packages
2014-08-02 10:51:57	MichaelTunnell	yep
2014-08-02 10:57:56	MichaelTunnell	do you know why empathy is used instead of Pidgin?
2014-08-02 10:58:04	MichaelTunnell	in the GNOME antergos version
2014-08-02 10:58:14	Noxbru	probably because of the integration with the rest of the desktop
2014-08-02 10:59:31	MichaelTunnell	ahh that makes sense

2014-08-03 10:35:43	Eldunar	hello i heard about this distro. What can u tell me about it?
2014-08-03 10:36:00	Noxbru	hi Eldunar, what do you want to know?
2014-08-03 10:36:35	Eldunar	what is the main difference between arch and ... manjaro?
2014-08-03 10:37:19	Eldunar	i wanted arch because of fresh packages because i have fresh stuff laptop. Ubuntu do not support mine graphic card and i need newest packages
2014-08-03 10:37:28	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: Manjaro is a fork...a terrible fork. Antergos is not a fork it is a simplified installer for Arch. When you use Antergos you are installing Arch not a separate distro
2014-08-03 10:37:32	Eldunar	but pure arch installation drived me mad
2014-08-03 10:37:42	MichaelTunnell	you get Arch repos and AUR directly
2014-08-03 10:38:42	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro you get pointlessly messed up repos and an AUR with no possibility of support. Antergos users can get AUR support from the maintainers because they are using Arch essentially. Manjaro users are not using Arch.
2014-08-03 10:39:13	Eldunar	hmm... so antergos is best way to use arch for newbies?
2014-08-03 10:39:31	Noxbru	Eldunar: mostly what MichaelTunnell said :)
2014-08-03 10:39:46	MichaelTunnell	honestly I dont think newbies should ever use Arch because Arch is not very forgiving to non experienced users
2014-08-03 10:39:53	Noxbru	I think of Antergos as Arch + easy install + some prechosen packages for every desktop :)
2014-08-03 10:39:56	Eldunar	so antergos is arch for lazy ppl?:D
2014-08-03 10:40:12	MichaelTunnell	but if they insist on doing it anyway then Antergos is the easiest way to get started with Arch and still have genuine arch
2014-08-03 10:40:54	Noxbru	I also agree with MichaelTunnell about Arch not being for newbies in linux, at least, not for newbies who don't try a bit to solve the problems that may arise
2014-08-03 10:40:56	Eldunar	why arch is not for beginers?
2014-08-03 10:41:42	Eldunar	i will start 1st degree of IT in university. Do u think that arch will be good distro for me to understand Linux?
2014-08-03 10:41:48	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is still arch so it still suffers from the same problems Arch does. Always Up to date packages are great but can also be a problem at times...such as when graphic drivers are not compatible with the latest kernel and they break forcing action to be needed to bypass the issue until it is fixed
2014-08-03 10:42:36	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: Arch is a fantastic distro to learn but installing with Antergos bypasses a lot of the education....installing the proper way provides the best learning experience
2014-08-03 10:42:51	Noxbru	or when an update in X breaks Y as it happened to me with the kernel and vdpau :)
2014-08-03 10:43:24	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: yep...it doesn't happen as much as it used to but it still happens
2014-08-03 10:43:51	Noxbru	but you can still install Arch in a VM to learn the installation problem without having to spend hours trying to get a functional system
2014-08-03 10:44:12	MichaelTunnell	I used to use Arch about 5 years ago and it was a minefield...now these issues are sporadic though still there
2014-08-03 10:44:26	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: true I would suggest the same
2014-08-03 10:44:39	MichaelTunnell	VM is the best way to learn since you dont have to break anything to do it
2014-08-03 10:44:40	Eldunar	but as i said earlier... i tried install arch... twice... and it left me with no grub installed:P
2014-08-03 10:44:54	Noxbru	MichaelTunnell: may be related to the fact that I use mesa from the git repo (^_^)
2014-08-03 10:45:06	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: :) that could be it
2014-08-03 10:45:25	Noxbru	like when they enabled hyperz by default XD r600 drivers almost broke
2014-08-03 10:45:48	MichaelTunnell	ahh that could be messy
2014-08-03 10:46:16	Noxbru	Eldunar: that's strange... I remember that installing grub was one of the first steps
2014-08-03 10:46:33	Eldunar	now its one of the latest:P
2014-08-03 10:46:41	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: use a VM for the learning...if it fails, oh well just try again nothing really loses when you use a VM
2014-08-03 10:47:19	Noxbru	true... step 2.12 in the Beginners installation guide https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners
2014-08-03 10:47:24	Eldunar	yeah but.... i have slow net connection and downloading whole system one by one
2014-08-03 10:48:31	MichaelTunnell	but per your question about Lazy Arch...no, not at all. Antergos isn't for the lazy it is for the people who don't have the time to do proper arch. I haven't been arch in years because I dont have the time to sit down and do the install so I used various distros but now that Antergos is available I can get back in quickly.
2014-08-03 10:48:34	Eldunar	i can download files with 90 KB/s

2014-08-03 10:49:02	MichaelTunnell	if you install Arch the proper way and then you bork the system like I did then you get very anxious about using it again...now with Antergos that anxiety is gone
2014-08-03 10:49:46	Eldunar	so the best way will be manjaro i see... i  am now scarried about using arch:P
2014-08-03 10:49:48	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: Antergos downloads everything just like Arch would...either way that is your bottleneck. So if you want to use Arch that is not avoidable.
2014-08-03 10:50:08	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro is a giant piece of crap.
2014-08-03 10:50:54	Eldunar	why exactly is crap?
2014-08-03 10:51:00	Noxbru	Eldunar: don't be afraid of Arch :) their wiki is excelent
2014-08-03 10:51:19	MichaelTunnell	you shouldn't be scared by my experience. I dealt with that happening 5 years ago. Most people know that Technology improves at insane rates....well Linux is even faster so 5 Years in Linux is like 30 years in other industries
2014-08-03 10:52:38	dmnmsc	Eldunar: Which desktop enviroment are you planning to use?
2014-08-03 10:52:45	Eldunar	XFCE
2014-08-03 10:52:49	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: here is a rant I made about Manjaro 3 months ago...it doesn't have everything but it has a lot of it. http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/24bdh8/what_does_rlinux_think_of_manjaro/ch5tuot
2014-08-03 10:53:21	MichaelTunnell	it doesn't have everything I don't like about Manjaro but has a lot of it*
2014-08-03 10:55:21	dmnmsc	I used Chakra, Manjaro and Antergos. I prefer Chakra and Antergos
2014-08-03 10:55:28	Noxbru	yesterday I discovered that Manjaro uses xfce 4.11 for their system... so I don't know what to think about them... on one side, I like updated software, but... 4.11 is the dev version, so it may have bugs and it shouldn't be considered stable
2014-08-03 10:57:25	Eldunar	manjaro 0.9 windows/mac.... so where is linux?:D
2014-08-03 10:58:15	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: I dont know what the hell they are talking about
2014-08-03 10:58:49	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: agreed...they claim stability yet use a dev version of the main DE they support...that makes no sense. Manjaro is so broken
2014-08-03 10:59:22	Eldunar	i hae to say that... arch and arch based comunity is more kind tan user friendly Ubuntu comunity:D
2014-08-03 11:00:12	Noxbru	Eldunar: that's because you haven't seen me rant in twitter XD
2014-08-03 11:00:56	Eldunar	no problem:P u have not seen polish comunity in ubuntu:P or even eng comunity
2014-08-03 11:01:59	Noxbru	nopes... but if you try to look first at the wiki then I won't complain :)
2014-08-03 11:02:03	Eldunar	hmm... u said that AUR is full of beta stuff.. is there some sort of stable repo?
2014-08-03 11:02:52	Noxbru	well... AUR also have stable stuff, but not 'used enough' to be promoted to community
2014-08-03 11:03:14	Eldunar	Noxbru, i am asking linving people what they think about arch. Wiki will be when ill have some trouble with system itself.
2014-08-03 11:03:46	Eldunar	so there is not any stable repo, just hardcore stuff and for middle advanced ppl?
2014-08-03 11:04:02	Noxbru	everything in Arch's repo is stable
2014-08-03 11:04:45	Noxbru	at least, according to the developers of the packages, of course, some kind of bugs may slip
2014-08-03 11:04:56	Noxbru	like my vdpau issue :)
2014-08-03 11:06:29	Eldunar	ok so ill try to install antergos stuff. If it will not fall after install ill use it on my laptop:) Than u guys for kind conversation:)
2014-08-03 11:06:52	Noxbru	you are welcome :)
2014-08-03 11:06:59	Noxbru	if you need anything just ask!
2014-08-03 11:07:38	Eldunar	do not worry.... il will :D:D
2014-08-03 11:09:03	Eldunar	have a nice day guys!!:) se ya:)

2014-08-03 11:11:41	MichaelTunnell	dang missed the last topic
2014-08-03 11:11:43	MichaelTunnell	oh well
2014-08-03 11:16:45	MichaelTunnell	I found out last night that there is a guy who is on the support team for Manjaro who has been using Linux (any kind) for 9 months
2014-08-03 11:16:54	MichaelTunnell	that seems a bit scary
2014-08-03 11:18:00	Noxbru	you can learn a lot in 9 months, maybe not enough to help with some system problems, but with 'user problems' may be enough
2014-08-03 11:22:42	MichaelTunnell	but to get on an official team that quick...weird
2014-08-03 11:27:25	Noxbru	one of the team is younger than me
2014-08-03 11:28:16	Noxbru	and I'm not even a quarter of century old :)
2014-08-03 11:28:37	MichaelTunnell	age is not important to me but time in Linux means a lot I think
2014-08-03 11:29:15	MichaelTunnell	I know a lot of kids at like 15 that are impressive in Linux skill but they have been using it for a while even at their age
2014-08-03 11:29:15	Noxbru	I think that age may be important, it may give you experience in handling certain situations

2014-08-03 11:45:15	Noxbru	how many distros do we need?

2014-08-03 13:03:15	aitorpazos	hi!!! I'm a happy Arch user and I'm interested in antergos as it might be an option I can recommend to my not so techie friends..
2014-08-03 13:04:00	aitorpazos	but I have a question... do you use the same arch repos??
2014-08-03 13:17:20	MichaelTunnell	Antergos pretty much a simple installer for Arch...it has all the official repos and the AUR
2014-08-03 13:17:45	MichaelTunnell	the Antergos repos are just for extra polish and to simplify things but they don't need to be used at all.
2014-08-03 13:18:13	MichaelTunnell	though I wouldnt give anything Arch related to non-techie people...that is dangerous and potential for them to hate you and to hate Linux
2014-08-03 13:24:03	aitorpazos	@MichaelTunnell got it thanks!!! I was thinking on friends who already use Linux, but might not be willing to deal with command line installations ;)

2014-08-03 13:25:25	JacobGuy7800	I wiped my usb before dd-ing it
2014-08-03 13:25:35	MichaelTunnell	if they are not comfortable with using something like that then they should not be using an Arch base because breakage is inevitable with Arch
2014-08-03 13:25:53	JacobGuy7800	I just need to get it working
2014-08-03 13:26:02	MichaelTunnell	if you want to be the guy who fixes it for everyone and because the arch support guy for them sure go ahead but I doubt you will want to do that for long :)

2014-08-03 13:28:58	JacobGuy7800	I wanted to get away from Ubuntu
2014-08-03 13:29:14	JacobGuy7800	I tried Evo/Lution, Manjaro, and now Antergos.
2014-08-03 13:29:19	MichaelTunnell	that crap?
2014-08-03 13:29:29	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is very picky about how it is put on a drive
2014-08-03 13:29:52	JacobGuy7800	Oh

2014-08-03 18:13:02	saimouer	Any clue?

2014-08-03 20:57:56	fpqc	hey
2014-08-03 20:58:03	MichaelTunnell	hi
2014-08-03 20:58:28	fpqc	anybody willing to make a .tar.gz of your /etc/lightdm from antergos so I can get a copy
2014-08-03 20:58:33	fpqc	mine is totally screwed up
2014-08-03 20:58:43	fpqc	I broke the antergos greeter
2014-08-03 21:00:09	fpqc	the webkit greeter just totally breaks for me =/
2014-08-03 21:00:30	fpqc	I was able to reconfig lightdm using lightdm-another-gtk-greeter
2014-08-03 21:00:47	MichaelTunnell	do you use gnome
2014-08-03 21:00:52	fpqc	cinnamon
2014-08-03 21:02:10	MichaelTunnell	I'd give you webkit greeter but not worth sanitizing the other stuff
2014-08-03 21:02:13	fpqc	btw did you notice that in 3.12 of gdm they finally documented how you're supposed to rotate the screen
2014-08-03 21:02:23	MichaelTunnell	you could just load it up in a live usb and copy the files from there
2014-08-03 21:02:51	fpqc	could I get it by decompressing one of the packages off the repo
2014-08-03 21:03:00	fpqc	and if so which ones
2014-08-03 21:04:20	fpqc	(I told a white lie.. I'm actually on a vanilla install of arch, but I added the antergos repo because whatshisname always updates pacmanxg4 and gets it looking nice)
2014-08-03 21:04:45	fpqc	(whenever I install it from AUR, it's all pixellated)
2014-08-03 21:05:20	MichaelTunnell	I dont help liars so good luck
2014-08-03 21:05:31	MichaelTunnell	kidding just stalling :)
2014-08-03 21:05:32	fpqc	=p
2014-08-03 21:06:18	fpqc	btw, did you know that if you compile a lot of crap off the aur
2014-08-03 21:06:28	fpqc	there's now an officially supported way to skip the compression step
2014-08-03 21:06:40	MichaelTunnell	how so
2014-08-03 21:06:40	fpqc	it's in the makepkg config
2014-08-03 21:06:48	MichaelTunnell	oh interesting
2014-08-03 21:07:01	MichaelTunnell	ok I found some info
2014-08-03 21:07:03	fpqc	just change the 'accepted extension' from .tar.xz to .tar
2014-08-03 21:07:21	fpqc	i don't remember if it's called 'accepted extension'
2014-08-03 21:07:25	fpqc	but it's near the bottom of the file
2014-08-03 21:07:57	MichaelTunnell	keys.conf, lightdm.conf, users.conf and xsession are stored in lightdm-1:1.10.1-3-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
2014-08-03 21:08:14	fpqc	on which repo
2014-08-03 21:08:22	fpqc	testing?
2014-08-03 21:08:30	fpqc	or community-testing
2014-08-03 21:08:35	fpqc	or just community
2014-08-03 21:08:40	MichaelTunnell	community
2014-08-03 21:08:51	fpqc	iirc I looked at the raw list for antergos and it doesn't have the lightdm pkg
2014-08-03 21:09:00	MichaelTunnell	that particular version is from community though there may be other versions in testing
2014-08-03 21:09:08	MichaelTunnell	it does have it
2014-08-03 21:09:13	fpqc	but it does have a version with the same # as on community
2014-08-03 21:09:16	MichaelTunnell	it even as a lightdm theme for antergos
2014-08-03 21:09:22	fpqc	for lightdm-webkit-greeter
2014-08-03 21:09:26	MichaelTunnell	lightdm-webkit-theme-antergos-2.0.1-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
2014-08-03 21:09:29	fpqc	yes
2014-08-03 21:09:43	fpqc	but I don't have the default config
2014-08-03 21:09:49	MichaelTunnell	lightdm-webkit-greeter-0.1.2-6-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
2014-08-03 21:09:53	fpqc	for lightdm-webkit-greeter from antergos
2014-08-03 21:10:03	MichaelTunnell	I have all of those packages in my cache...I and host them if you want them
2014-08-03 21:10:07	fpqc	is that in the pkg?
2014-08-03 21:10:21	MichaelTunnell	those are all separate packages but yes
2014-08-03 21:10:23	fpqc	I can just wget from repos.antergos.com
2014-08-03 21:10:34	MichaelTunnell	should be able to
2014-08-03 21:10:50	fpqc	you're sure that there isn't any sneaky thing
2014-08-03 21:10:58	fpqc	in that package antergos-gnome-configuration
2014-08-03 21:11:06	fpqc	or whatever it's called
2014-08-03 21:11:30	fpqc	it's like antergos-gnome-defaults or something
2014-08-03 21:12:05	MichaelTunnell	antergos-gnome-defaults-list-1.0-1-any.pkg.tar.xz does not contain anything to do with lightdm
2014-08-03 21:12:32	fpqc	oh
2014-08-03 21:12:41	fpqc	what does that one do
2014-08-03 21:13:29	MichaelTunnell	it contains the default list for mimetypes and such
2014-08-03 21:13:44	MichaelTunnell	what programs to use to open types of files
2014-08-03 21:13:46	fpqc	sure
2014-08-03 21:14:02	fpqc	but if I'm installing gnome off the community repo
2014-08-03 21:14:13	fpqc	why would I need the antergos ver
2014-08-03 21:14:31	fpqc	oh wait, because antergos comes with slightly more bundled software
2014-08-03 21:14:35	fpqc	right?
2014-08-03 21:14:37	MichaelTunnell	you dont...the antergos version applies to applications it pulls in when installing a DE via Antergos
2014-08-03 21:14:44	fpqc	ah
2014-08-03 21:14:51	MichaelTunnell	if you dont install those applications there would be no reason to use that list
2014-08-03 21:15:22	MichaelTunnell	Antergos has a base install with no DE or default apps and then DE choices that come with preset defaults
2014-08-03 21:15:38	fpqc	yeah
2014-08-03 21:15:50	fpqc	the no-DM version is almost identical to vanilla arch
2014-08-03 21:15:51	MichaelTunnell	that package is for the gnome defaults...I think there are also default packages for all other supported DEs
2014-08-03 21:16:03	MichaelTunnell	indeed which is actually the point of it
2014-08-03 21:16:07	fpqc	yep
2014-08-03 21:16:19	fpqc	well the original point of the distro was to get cinnamon on arch
2014-08-03 21:16:29	MichaelTunnell	technically yes and no
2014-08-03 21:16:38	MichaelTunnell	the original point of Cinnarch was that
2014-08-03 21:16:41	fpqc	I was the guy who convinced the founder guy not to drop cinnamon support
2014-08-03 21:16:53	MichaelTunnell	but when it was changed to Antergos the goal of the project was changed too
2014-08-03 21:17:07	MichaelTunnell	good job then
2014-08-03 21:17:10	fpqc	ya
2014-08-03 21:17:20	fpqc	I was a go-between for him and the linuxmint team
2014-08-03 21:17:25	fpqc	and I set up a meeting for them
2014-08-03 21:17:32	fpqc	and they worked it out in a week
2014-08-03 21:17:38	MichaelTunnell	I am a fan of Cinnamon as well...though currently running GNOME it has a few pissy things but mostly it is awesome
2014-08-03 21:17:42	fpqc	to prevent cinnamon from getting taken off the arch community repo
2014-08-03 21:17:46	fpqc	when it was incompatible with gnome 3.8
2014-08-03 21:17:58	MichaelTunnell	nice
2014-08-03 21:18:00	fpqc	the gnome team
2014-08-03 21:18:03	fpqc	are assholes
2014-08-03 21:18:13	fpqc	if you go to the cinnamon team's irc channel
2014-08-03 21:18:22	fpqc	you can talk to the devs
2014-08-03 21:18:29	fpqc	very down to earth
2014-08-03 21:18:41	fpqc	gnome's team just removes features all the time
2014-08-03 21:18:53	MichaelTunnell	but do you ever talk to them
2014-08-03 21:19:04	fpqc	and then when people complain that they removed features, they say that you're in the wrong place to complain
2014-08-03 21:19:11	MichaelTunnell	they remove features very seldom they just remove a LOT lol
2014-08-03 21:19:11	fpqc	because there is no right place to complain
2014-08-03 21:19:32	fpqc	MichaelTunnell, you can't get in contact with the gnome team
2014-08-03 21:19:44	fpqc	hte problem with gnome is that it's run by redhat devs
2014-08-03 21:20:02	fpqc	that's also why they purposely break theme support every version
2014-08-03 21:20:13	MichaelTunnell	well I can understand why they make it difficult so they dont have to deal with all the hate but there are a few people you can get in touch with via mailing list and social sites
2014-08-03 21:20:15	fpqc	because then oly the in-house redhat themes work right
2014-08-03 21:20:33	fpqc	MichaelTunnell, they remove features that cause no bugs
2014-08-03 21:20:40	fpqc	and then when asked why, they give no explanation
2014-08-03 21:20:42	fpqc	it's hilarious
2014-08-03 21:20:49	fpqc	compare nemo to nautilus
2014-08-03 21:20:57	MichaelTunnell	they dont really do that though...they have version declaration in the manifests so something says it doesnt support a version when it really does
2014-08-03 21:20:59	fpqc	nemo is based on an early version of nautilus
2014-08-03 21:21:16	fpqc	nautilus is all but useless
2014-08-03 21:21:22	MichaelTunnell	Quick Close extension for example has not been updated since 3.8 but it works fine on 3.10 and 3.12 it just needs the manifest changesd
2014-08-03 21:21:33	MichaelTunnell	change the manifest listing and bam works perfectly
2014-08-03 21:21:46	MichaelTunnell	that is a problem though...but more of an annoyance than a huge deal
2014-08-03 21:21:55	fpqc	I've been using a rethemed gnome-terminal 3.4
2014-08-03 21:21:55	<--	s8321414 (~s8321414@host-56.13-234-182.cable.dynamic.kbtelecom.net) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2014-08-03 21:21:58	MichaelTunnell	nautilus is crap now I do agree with that completely
2014-08-03 21:22:02	fpqc	since they removed the background support
2014-08-03 21:22:06	MichaelTunnell	I use Nemo instead
2014-08-03 21:22:06	fpqc	custom backgrounds
2014-08-03 21:22:10	fpqc	try spacefm
2014-08-03 21:22:24	MichaelTunnell	I dont care about backgrounds for terminal...basic terminal is fine for me
2014-08-03 21:22:42	fpqc	MichaelTunnell, it was a feature
2014-08-03 21:22:49	fpqc	and they removed it for no good reason
2014-08-03 21:23:24	MichaelTunnell	do you have solid evidence that says it caused no problems because they said it did and it was removed because of the way it was implemented would be broken
2014-08-03 21:23:36	fpqc	yes there was a big thread on the bug tracker
2014-08-03 21:24:07	MichaelTunnell	interesting though doesnt affect me so I suppose that is why I never bothered to look
2014-08-03 21:24:36	MichaelTunnell	I am getting a ton of useless errors with Totem lately that are not enough info to solve the problem so I just went to mpv
2014-08-03 21:24:45	fpqc	imo, there is no reason ever to remove features if they don't cause problems
2014-08-03 21:24:59	fpqc	you can hide the options under an 'advanced' settings
2014-08-03 21:25:20	MichaelTunnell	sure there is...one reason would be to be able to manage the framework...they redid basically everything and they need to streamline it
2014-08-03 21:25:34	fpqc	the change to gnome-terminal was
2014-08-03 21:25:45	fpqc	they clipped out a big chunk of code
2014-08-03 21:25:49	fpqc	slapped each other on the back
2014-08-03 21:25:53	fpqc	and made no other changes
2014-08-03 21:26:48	fpqc	also if you're going to rewrite the program from scratch, it's stupid to force people to upgrade with it
2014-08-03 21:26:52	fpqc	fork the project
2014-08-03 21:27:17	MichaelTunnell	well that is absurd
2014-08-03 21:27:25	MichaelTunnell	you think they should fork their own project?
2014-08-03 21:27:29	MichaelTunnell	that doesnt make sense
2014-08-03 21:27:51	fpqc	well MATE is just the original fork of gnome2
2014-08-03 21:27:56	MichaelTunnell	I know
2014-08-03 21:28:12	fpqc	look, when you update on the original name
2014-08-03 21:28:21	fpqc	you should always preserve backwards compatibility
2014-08-03 21:28:34	MichaelTunnell	not true
2014-08-03 21:28:37	fpqc	if you are breaking compatibility, you should fork up a version
2014-08-03 21:28:39	MichaelTunnell	that is not always practical to do
2014-08-03 21:29:02	fpqc	example?
2014-08-03 21:29:31	MichaelTunnell	for example, an app I work on went from GTK2 to GTK3 support...there was completely breakage from GTK3 version and the GTK2 version was abandoned because there is no reason to support two different versions of the same toolkit
2014-08-03 21:29:44	fpqc	ah yes but
2014-08-03 21:29:47	MichaelTunnell	so we have people calling us assholes because we dont support dead technology
2014-08-03 21:29:48	fpqc	that's the problem right
2014-08-03 21:30:11	fpqc	that's because you can't even get the de that gtk2 came from anymore
2014-08-03 21:30:12	MichaelTunnell	it wasnt that the apps broke
2014-08-03 21:30:29	fpqc	look, what I'm saying is that in a distro like arch
2014-08-03 21:30:30	MichaelTunnell	it just meant the gtk2 version only worked on old distros that used gtk2 and the gtk3 was continued
2014-08-03 21:30:43	MichaelTunnell	not true
2014-08-03 21:30:46	fpqc	you should never have pacman -Su send them hurtling off a cliff
2014-08-03 21:30:49	MichaelTunnell	xfce is built on gtk2
2014-08-03 21:30:52	MichaelTunnell	lxde is as well
2014-08-03 21:30:54	MichaelTunnell	mate is as well
2014-08-03 21:30:57	fpqc	lxde is not
2014-08-03 21:31:01	MichaelTunnell	mate is converted to both
2014-08-03 21:31:05	MichaelTunnell	yes it is
2014-08-03 21:31:09	MichaelTunnell	lxde is gtk2

2014-08-03 21:31:30	MichaelTunnell	mate is being converted to both...not there yet
2014-08-03 21:31:32	fpqc	I am pretty sure lxde is based on raw X

2014-08-03 21:34:45	MichaelTunnell	4th feature listed ...GTK2
2014-08-03 21:35:23	MichaelTunnell	so like I said a lot of GTK2 is still active and actively used
2014-08-03 21:35:59	MichaelTunnell	but it is dead tech and you can use GTK2 and GTK3 at the same time just adds more packages to your system
2014-08-03 21:36:18	MichaelTunnell	yet we still get people asking for gtk2 versions which makes no sense
2014-08-03 21:36:58	MichaelTunnell	it has stopped happening this past year though so that is great...in 2012 it was happening at least a couple times a week
2014-08-03 21:38:04	MichaelTunnell	most users cant accept the fact that sometimes stuff just has to evolve and sometimes that means not supporting something to support other things and sometimes features become impractical or not as useful...it just happens
2014-08-03 21:38:23	MichaelTunnell	GNOME chopped off a LOT of stuff and that sucks but I do understand why they did it
2014-08-03 21:38:47	fpqc	why do they constantly break themes
2014-08-03 21:42:16	MichaelTunnell	they dont...the structure makes breakage because of the versioning calls
2014-08-03 21:42:30	MichaelTunnell	you have to say "this works in version 3.10" and it works
2014-08-03 21:42:45	MichaelTunnell	if you dont tell it to consider it for that version
2014-08-03 21:42:48	MichaelTunnell	it wont work
2014-08-03 21:44:24	MichaelTunnell	most extensions and themes can be fixed by saying "3.12" in a config file
2014-08-03 21:44:38	MichaelTunnell	not always but most of the time that is the case
2014-08-03 21:46:26	fpqc	idk
2014-08-03 21:46:39	fpqc	I'm going to try the numix-solarized themes off the aur
2014-08-03 21:48:01	MichaelTunnell	cool
2014-08-03 21:48:52	fpqc	oh wow
2014-08-03 21:49:03	fpqc	the numix-solarized is sexy
2014-08-03 21:49:31	fpqc	one gripe I have with the cinnamon guys is
2014-08-03 21:49:42	fpqc	they should figure out a way to generate cinnamon themes from gtk themes
2014-08-03 21:53:07	MichaelTunnell	fpqc: they should just make cinnamon themes have more power
2014-08-03 21:53:17	MichaelTunnell	and they have weird bugs I found in cinnamon
2014-08-03 21:53:22	MichaelTunnell	theme wise
2014-08-03 21:53:29	MichaelTunnell	I fixed a few
2014-08-03 21:55:28	MichaelTunnell	the Numix Cinnamon theme that someone made was clunky and not good enough imo so I kind of forked it and made my own that is a lot more customizable to the level that the gtk theme is
2014-08-03 21:55:52	fpqc	MichaelTunnell put it on the AUR mang
2014-08-03 21:56:23	fpqc	and could you make a version to match the solarized colorscheme
2014-08-03 21:57:36	MichaelTunnell	I made it to be matchable but not for me to match it :) though I probably could pretty easily
2014-08-03 21:58:17	fpqc	how did you make it matchable
2014-08-03 21:58:31	fpqc	with an editable pkgbuild that lets you pick colors?
2014-08-03 22:00:41	MichaelTunnell	it isnt in the AUR at all
2014-08-03 22:01:21	fpqc	well you lose nothing by uploading it =p
2014-08-03 22:01:22	MichaelTunnell	it would be released in teh Cinnamon Spices if I released it :)
2014-08-03 22:01:39	MichaelTunnell	I created it to release but I havent finished it because of my other projects as well
2014-08-03 22:01:45	fpqc	ah
2014-08-03 22:02:03	fpqc	btw did you notice that cinnamon spices is shooting up 404s left and right?
2014-08-03 22:02:04	MichaelTunnell	it is done like 90% just needs polish and possibly documentation
2014-08-03 22:02:17	MichaelTunnell	no I havent used cinnamon in about a month
2014-08-03 22:02:25	fpqc	at least for modules
2014-08-03 22:02:43	fpqc	they show up in the download section of applets
2014-08-03 22:02:47	fpqc	but when you try to dl, you get a 404
2014-08-03 22:02:53	fpqc	why are you using gnome3 btw
2014-08-03 22:03:50	fpqc	I tried to give it a shot, but they made it impossible to map the toggle fullscreen menu thing mappable to a side mouse button
2014-08-03 22:04:14	fpqc	also there's a long-running gnome bug that still hasn't been fixed
2014-08-03 22:04:36	fpqc	you cannot assign the keycombo super_L + t to open gnome-terminal
2014-08-03 22:05:01	fpqc	it's in both cinnamon and gnome
2014-08-03 22:05:08	fpqc	the cinnamon guys said it's an upstream problem with gnome
2014-08-03 22:09:31	MichaelTunnell	toggle fullscreen menu? what do you mean with that

2014-08-04 08:10:48	Noxbru	hi Frozenx, it depends on your connection, but in my case it was like ~45 min - 1 hour
2014-08-04 08:12:03	Frozenx	I heard that Cnchi download the whole OS (1+ GB) from internet, is it true?
2014-08-04 08:12:27	Noxbru	it is, although the downloaded size depends on the desktop you have chosen
2014-08-04 08:14:28	Frozenx	Because of my freaking slow internet speed, I spent 10+ hours in installation, which is very overwhelming to me.
2014-08-04 08:15:19	Noxbru	it is, yes
2014-08-04 08:17:02	Frozenx	Why not provide 1 more option in Cnchi to straight install the distro (GNOME only) using the resources in the iso?
2014-08-04 08:19:48	Noxbru	that has been asked before, and if I remember correctly, the answer is a mixture of:
2014-08-04 08:19:51	Noxbru	- the iso would be very big
2014-08-04 08:19:53	Noxbru	- the iso is not updated frequently, and the provided packages would be old
2014-08-04 08:19:55	Noxbru	- in the end, you will need to update your system to the latest version, thus downloading everything twice (1 for iso + 1 for update)
2014-08-04 08:21:03	Frozenx	The iso is not updated frequently? Isn't it update every week?
2014-08-04 08:23:00	Frozenx	For the 3rd point, every other distro (except Arch, Antergos, Gentoo) need to update the system to the latest version after installation.
2014-08-04 08:23:46	Noxbru	seeing that the latest iso is from June...
2014-08-04 08:24:18	Noxbru	and in the case of Arch, everything updates A LOT, so the volume of changes is bigger than in other distros
2014-08-04 08:24:52	Frozenx	But in my knowledge other major distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE never update their iso after first release.
2014-08-04 08:25:45	Noxbru	not entirely true, Ubuntu LTS is updated every while
2014-08-04 08:26:02	Noxbru	but the point is in the volume and magnitude of the change
2014-08-04 08:27:12	-->	HighValueWarrior (~HighValue@unaffiliated/highvaluewarrior) has joined #antergos
2014-08-04 08:29:03	Frozenx	The long time needed for installation is the only reason that keeping me from using Antergos. In other distro, while I'm updating my OS, I still can use the computer to do other stuffs. But in Antergos, I can't do anything during installation. And because of it took too much of time, the usb or cd will sometimes unmount automatically during installation (I experienced that a few times already).
2014-08-04 08:30:32	Noxbru	I'm sorry to hear that
2014-08-04 08:30:53	HighValueWarrior	loool
2014-08-04 08:36:04	Frozenx	But other than that Antergos is pretty nice, nicer than any other GNOME distros I tried before. I leave it because I still do not have the experience to maintain a bleeding edge rolling distro, and I'm not really get into pacman. I will give it another try when I'm more experienced.

2014-08-04 16:57:56	JacobGuy7800	So I wanted to have a "linuxusr" folder of some sort on that drive.
2014-08-04 16:58:18	JacobGuy7800	Eff it, I'm creating a seperate partiton on that drive
2014-08-04 16:58:29	JacobGuy7800	Not worth it.

2014-08-04 22:36:33	MichaelTunnell	I havent tried the KDE version
2014-08-04 22:36:44	MichaelTunnell	you should try the Base install and then add KDE from the repo

2014-08-04 22:40:38	arshavin	try creating new virtual disk
2014-08-04 22:41:09	Eldunar	yeah, i will now try to install on 12 GB and to create manually partitions
2014-08-04 22:42:01	arshavin	but why would you want to install kde in virtualbox
2014-08-04 22:42:28	arshavin	I am waiting for stable plasma-desktop 5
2014-08-04 22:43:08	Eldunar	just i am curious about KDE which come with antergos OOTB
2014-08-04 22:43:30	arshavin	the new kde has made me really consider kde for the first time during my 6 years of linux
2014-08-04 22:43:49	Eldunar	yeah? ill look on yt
2014-08-04 22:44:28	arshavin	I tried installing it from aur,the desktop worked but many kde apps were not working so got rid of it
2014-08-04 22:44:47	arshavin	the desktop itelf looked very impressive though
2014-08-04 22:44:57	arshavin	*itself
2014-08-04 22:45:56	Eldunar	i can not decide if i will be using KDE or XFCE.
2014-08-04 22:47:08	arshavin	yeah it's always a difficult decision,while there was gnome2,I had never considered using any other DE,but since gnome3 I have tried almost everything,but still can't decide
2014-08-04 22:47:56	arshavin	but I have preferred gtk so I have mostly been on xfce or mate
2014-08-04 22:47:57	Eldunar	gnome 3 ONLY touch screens. This new way of desktop... mistake for desktops\
2014-08-04 22:48:38	arshavin	indeed the future of Desktop DEs looks bleak for those who don't own touch devices
2014-08-04 22:49:03	arshavin	Gnome3 has completely lost its senses
2014-08-04 22:49:24	Aethysius	I use a mouse with GNOME3.
2014-08-04 22:49:47	Eldunar	yeah but moving mouse from corner to corner its.... not for me.
2014-08-04 22:50:03	Aethysius	Ah.
2014-08-04 22:50:05	arshavin	even I hate that
2014-08-04 22:50:33	Eldunar	XFCE -> customizeable lighweight and with compiz and emerald nice looking. And KDE... just KDE:P
2014-08-04 22:51:02	arshavin	It will be interesting to see which way mate 1.10 goes since it has decided to move o gtk3
2014-08-04 22:52:15	arshavin	xfce is good but when using xfce,I have always felt something missing
2014-08-04 22:52:15	Eldunar	hmm i am interested how lxqt will be looking in total stable release:D
2014-08-04 22:52:54	arshavin	I tried that too,it looks good,just qt alternative to lxde
2014-08-04 22:53:57	Eldunar	i want to reanimate my olt computer with lxqt but i am waiting only for final release of lxqt;p
2014-08-04 22:54:07	arshavin	there is another desktop i'm looking forward to moonlight,they are going to release alpha this year
2014-08-04 22:54:36	Eldunar	moonlight? ill check this out.
2014-08-04 22:54:41	arshavin	you can use lxde in the meantime

2014-08-05 09:44:55	Eldunar	hello when i want to update sth i receive that: can not resolve host:
2014-08-05 09:45:18	Noxbru	which host? the antergos repo?
2014-08-05 09:45:28	Eldunar	i installed base install antergos on vbox
2014-08-05 09:45:43	Eldunar	repo.antergos.info
2014-08-05 09:45:46	Eldunar	and so one
2014-08-05 09:46:02	Eldunar	i typed : pacman -Syyu
2014-08-05 09:46:41	Eldunar	i found simmilar problem on arch wiki, they said that i have to disable ipv6 in kernel. but i do not know why.
2014-08-05 09:46:49	Eldunar	how
2014-08-05 09:47:21	Noxbru	ehm... no idea... I haave just checked here and I have no problems
2014-08-05 09:47:55	Noxbru	what's the 'exact' output of pacman -Syu ?
2014-08-05 09:48:07	Eldunar	hmm... i have an ide. plz wait a while bro:)
2014-08-05 09:48:19	Noxbru	maybe you are trying to update against a down server
2014-08-05 09:50:48	Eldunar	ok i have no idea.
2014-08-05 09:51:01	-->	sinix (~sinix@207-229-187-214.c3-0.drb-ubr1.chi-drb.il.cable.rcn.com) has joined #antergos
2014-08-05 09:51:25	Eldunar	so i have a bunch of text could not connect to that and tht and that... hostname
2014-08-05 09:51:44	Noxbru	ok, and can you reach anywhere? google or something?
2014-08-05 09:52:14	Noxbru	I'm asking because I don't know if you are chatting from the same computer or not
2014-08-05 09:52:45	Eldunar	unknow hostname
2014-08-05 09:52:58	Eldunar	thats same computer but this is vbox
2014-08-05 09:52:58	Noxbru	so no 'ping www.google.com' ?
2014-08-05 09:53:09	Eldunar	yeah
2014-08-05 09:53:19	Noxbru	I suspect some kind of network problem with vbox
2014-08-05 09:53:33	Eldunar	in xfce antergos is good
2014-08-05 09:53:35	Noxbru	but I'm no expert, sorry
2014-08-05 09:54:04	Noxbru	or maybe... you have to start the network... I don't remember
2014-08-05 09:54:23	Eldunar	hmmm... i have no idea;/
2014-08-05 09:54:33	sinix	just jumping in and i saw vbox - what's the situation?  antergos/arch guest with no internet?
2014-08-05 09:54:48	Eldunar	i think thats problem
2014-08-05 09:54:54	Eldunar	but only base install
2014-08-05 09:55:04	Noxbru	sinix: Eldunar is having some network problems with a guest Antergos base in virtual box :)
2014-08-05 09:55:22	sinix	and you're using oracle's virtualbox program with host utils installed?
2014-08-05 09:55:56	Eldunar	yeah,i think because it downloaded via internet with live antergos cd stuff
2014-08-05 09:56:23	sinix	the first step is to take a look at what it says in the settings for that virtual machine
2014-08-05 09:56:27	sinix	there's a network tab
2014-08-05 09:57:15	Eldunar	there is nat
2014-08-05 09:57:29	sinix	"enabled"?
2014-08-05 09:57:47	sinix	is there a little "incompatible settings" exclamation point?
2014-08-05 09:58:50	Eldunar	english is not my native language. but ill say u that: in settings->network-> i have: 1st card connected to : nat
2014-08-05 09:59:33	sinix	ok - sorry, I'll be more clear!
2014-08-05 09:59:51	sinix	most vbox problems are because of lacking utilities and dependencies
2014-08-05 10:00:02	sinix	what OS is the host?
2014-08-05 10:00:11	Eldunar	Xubuntu 14.04
2014-08-05 10:00:43	Eldunar	but weird is that : antergos xfce is going good with net.
2014-08-05 10:00:55	Eldunar	i mean guest session in vbox
2014-08-05 10:00:56	sinix	sorry, dumb question, but does xubuntu use systemd?
2014-08-05 10:01:07	MichaelTunnell	sinix: no it does not
2014-08-05 10:01:14	superbia	hurray !
2014-08-05 10:01:20	MichaelTunnell	it is Ubuntu based so Upstart
2014-08-05 10:01:26	MichaelTunnell	but in about a year it will be systemd
2014-08-05 10:02:23	Eldunar	ill check if in software center i have all things marked with vbox
2014-08-05 10:02:41	MichaelTunnell	whoa why did you use the software center to install vbox?
2014-08-05 10:02:43	sinix	wait - you have internet in XFCE but not GNOME?
2014-08-05 10:03:03	MichaelTunnell	Ubuntu users should use the DEB from VirtualBox because the USC version is rather limited
2014-08-05 10:03:19	Eldunar	i have internet in xfce but not in CLI!:)
2014-08-05 10:03:25	sinix	ah
2014-08-05 10:04:15	sinix	did you try enabling it?
2014-08-05 10:04:33	sinix	 sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
2014-08-05 10:04:56	sinix	 sudo systemctl start dhcpcd
2014-08-05 10:05:22	Eldunar	u mean in arch?
2014-08-05 10:05:52	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: probably means arch...that wouldn't work in Ubuntu but not sure what he meant  completely
2014-08-05 10:05:53	sinix	in the virtualbox, yeah
2014-08-05 10:06:20	Eldunar	OMG OMG:D worked:)
2014-08-05 10:06:30	MichaelTunnell	nice
2014-08-05 10:06:33	sinix	great!
2014-08-05 10:06:52	Eldunar	okThank u:) i have to do i every time?
2014-08-05 10:06:53	sinix	if you did both the 'enable' line and the 'start' line, it should be fine to start automatically every time
2014-08-05 10:07:16	sinix	"start" just starts it once, "enable" starts it every time you boot up
2014-08-05 10:07:42	sinix	(but "enable" doesn't "start" so usually people do both at once)
2014-08-05 10:08:33	Eldunar	sorry, as u see i am now using ubuntu because it was simpler. I want to use arch( antergos) to learn linux. Thank u ill write it to my notes:)
2014-08-05 10:08:39	Eldunar	Thank u for help:)
2014-08-05 10:09:00	sinix	no problem!  antergos is a great OS for that purpose
2014-08-05 10:09:12	sinix	you can also try installing arch in a virtualbox directly
2014-08-05 10:09:15	superbia	antergos is great arch replacement sinix
2014-08-05 10:09:34	sinix	virtualbox is great because it gives you fake hardware that's really simple to configure
2014-08-05 10:09:44	Eldunar	i tried to install arch... but i failed with grub install
2014-08-05 10:09:48	superbia	well if u have VT enabled
2014-08-05 10:09:50	sinix	i agree superbia ! it's my main OS
2014-08-05 10:10:02	superbia	sinix: who wants to do luks/lvm again :P
2014-08-05 10:10:42	sinix	here's a great step-by-step guide for installing arch in a virtualbox:
2014-08-05 10:10:45	sinix	http://wideaperture.net/blog/?p=3851
2014-08-05 10:11:37	Eldunar	huge bunch of txt.. but thats good for newbies:P
2014-08-05 10:11:50	superbia	newbies want commands !!
2014-08-05 10:12:02	superbia	and see results quickly
2014-08-05 10:12:16	sinix	lots of pictures too!  and all the actual cli commands are highlighted so you know exactly what to type
2014-08-05 10:13:26	superbia	just curious, why did antergos go with gnome >
2014-08-05 10:13:48	MichaelTunnell	superbia: it didnt...the live usb is gnome but installing it you can pick anything you want
2014-08-05 10:14:03	superbia	MichaelTunnell: it says that the GNOME is the default
2014-08-05 10:14:07	superbia	for antergos linux
2014-08-05 10:14:11	Eldunar	to be honest. Ubuntu is not bad. But i hae relative new laptop and my graphic card is not supported with amd CCC ( radeon 8750m) and i need newest linux stuff ( which arch provide):)
2014-08-05 10:14:21	superbia	and also seems the most polished
2014-08-05 10:14:32	MichaelTunnell	superbia: there is not default...you can choose whatever you want in the installer. GNOME is just what is used in the live USB
2014-08-05 10:14:39	superbia	ah K
2014-08-05 10:14:41	superbia	k
2014-08-05 10:14:49	superbia	for example
2014-08-05 10:14:56	superbia	xfce looks like its being developed
2014-08-05 10:15:03	MichaelTunnell	and just because one is more polished does not make it a default
2014-08-05 10:15:06	sinix	to be fair, in the installer, it definitely says "GNOME (Default)"
2014-08-05 10:15:14	superbia	the icons in the xfce-panel are so non-visable
2014-08-05 10:15:16	MichaelTunnell	xfce is not being developed...they make one update a year
2014-08-05 10:15:27	superbia	theme is not so polished
2014-08-05 10:15:48	superbia	expecially volume/wifi/battery in the panel are so low-visable
2014-08-05 10:15:51	Eldunar	in my opinion XFCE is just for do it in your own way only;p
2014-08-05 10:15:51	superbia	on the default theme
2014-08-05 10:15:57	MichaelTunnell	sinix: that is just because GNOME is the live usb choice which is kind of saying "this is what you are using"
2014-08-05 10:16:16	MichaelTunnell	XFeCEs is one of the worst DEs ever
2014-08-05 10:16:20	superbia	what do pros use Eldunar MichaelTunnell  ?
2014-08-05 10:16:51	sinix	yeah, but it goes to superbia's point - Antergos is one of the only distros to offer multiple DEs, which i think is the best way to approach a DE, but it does make me curious as to why GNOME - but i guess it's really just a personal choice
2014-08-05 10:16:52	Eldunar	u mean what?
2014-08-05 10:16:58	MichaelTunnell	when a DE's project team say that have no plans for updating the system for GTK3 or Wayland then it is doomed
2014-08-05 10:17:16	MichaelTunnell	sinix: because GNOME is awesome
2014-08-05 10:17:23	MichaelTunnell	superbia: I use GNOME and Cinnamon
2014-08-05 10:17:28	MichaelTunnell	though right now mostly GNOME
2014-08-05 10:17:42	Eldunar	I use kde on desktop(manjaro) and here XFCE ( xubuntu)
2014-08-05 10:17:52	sinix	MichaelTunnell: agreed - I use Gnome as my base to get all the easy config tools, then I put a more minimal DE on there to actually work in
2014-08-05 10:18:01	Eldunar	but gnome is TOUCHABLE... not good for me
2014-08-05 10:18:17	sinix	GNOME solves all your wifi settings, theme settings, sound settings, etc, so easily
2014-08-05 10:19:01	MichaelTunnell	I hate XFCE...KDE is not bad but I dont like it
2014-08-05 10:19:08	superbia	i never used kde
2014-08-05 10:19:26	superbia	before i just used a ratpoison
2014-08-05 10:19:30	Eldunar	but its ... strange for me. I pref cinnamon ( better outfit than oryginal gnome)
2014-08-05 10:19:34	superbia	but now xfce seems light..
2014-08-05 10:19:38	sinix	KDE's fine, it's like what Microsoft SHOULDVE done with windows, but instead they did metro ;)
2014-08-05 10:19:50	superbia	metro sucks
2014-08-05 10:20:01	superbia	and is gnome really for touchscreens ??????
2014-08-05 10:20:11	Eldunar	metro do not sucks on Windows Phone
2014-08-05 10:20:22	sinix	imo, GNOME is the best touch/nontouch crossover interface ever
2014-08-05 10:20:22	Eldunar	and touch screens
2014-08-05 10:20:39	superbia	so GNOME works on a touchscreen ?
2014-08-05 10:20:57	sinix	yeah
2014-08-05 10:20:59	sinix	very well
2014-08-05 10:21:06	superbia	what other DE works on a touchscreen ?
2014-08-05 10:21:09	sinix	Unity
2014-08-05 10:21:18	superbia	what else ?
2014-08-05 10:21:24	MichaelTunnell	Unity has the best touch funcationality
2014-08-05 10:21:40	MichaelTunnell	KDE has decent functionality
2014-08-05 10:21:42	sinix	all of them "work" in that finger-touches can work as clicks, but gnome and unity are the only ones enabling things like swipe gestures and such
2014-08-05 10:21:55	sinix	o i didnt know KDE did too
2014-08-05 10:21:56	MichaelTunnell	GNOME doesn't really have much touch functionality even though you would probably expect it to
2014-08-05 10:22:11	<--	HighValueWarrior (~HighValue@unaffiliated/highvaluewarrior) has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2014-08-05 10:22:17	MichaelTunnell	sinix: KDE even has a branch of KDE just for touch :)
2014-08-05 10:22:32	MichaelTunnell	well not a branch exactly...KDE is weird in structure
2014-08-05 10:23:05	sinix	o nice, I'll have to check that out - i like play around with DEs, and I have a touchscreen laptop
2014-08-05 10:23:07	MichaelTunnell	GNOME has basics in touch which is good enough but it does not have touch as a focus...Unity does have it as a focus
2014-08-05 10:23:33	Eldunar	KDe netbook ( thats in its setttings)

2014-08-05 10:25:13	Eldunar	What do u think about enlightenment?:D
2014-08-05 10:25:46	Eldunar	i am going to check every de in artengros and this one looks interesting:P
2014-08-05 10:25:58	MichaelTunnell	Elightenment has a lot of potential but it is too buggy for me
2014-08-05 10:26:33	Eldunar	when i was on ubuntu-pl ppl said same about cinnamon:)
2014-08-05 10:26:44	Eldunar	but u said that u r using it:P
2014-08-05 10:28:15	Eldunar	every channel have its own pros and cons;p
2014-08-05 10:28:28	MichaelTunnell	ubuntu people not liking it is obvious but it depends on their reasons
2014-08-05 10:28:45	MichaelTunnell	if they are saying Cinnamon in Ubuntu then yes that could easily be buggy but that is absurd
2014-08-05 10:29:35	MichaelTunnell	but Cinnamon in Mint or Cinnamon in Arch is not buggy at all
2014-08-05 10:29:45	Eldunar	Cinnamon has sth from Windows.... nice aplication" menu.
2014-08-05 10:29:50	MichaelTunnell	but ANYTHING in Ubuntu alongside Unity is buggy because Unity makes it buggy
2014-08-05 10:29:52	Eldunar	so u recomend that
2014-08-05 10:29:58	superbia	fuck de-s
2014-08-05 10:30:02	superbia	use a wm...
2014-08-05 10:30:02	MichaelTunnell	sth?
2014-08-05 10:30:13	sinix	what do you use, superbia ?
2014-08-05 10:30:20	superbia	sinix: now xfce..
2014-08-05 10:30:27	MichaelTunnell	superbia: that is a de lol
2014-08-05 10:30:41	Eldunar	Openbox in Manjaro flag flavour looks nice
2014-08-05 10:30:42	sinix	that's just a lighter DE ;)
2014-08-05 10:30:44	superbia	i did use ratpoison on archlinux for almost a year
2014-08-05 10:31:01	sinix	right on
2014-08-05 10:31:06	superbia	arch, ratpoison, wpa-supplicant and all that good stuff
2014-08-05 10:31:11	MichaelTunnell	ratpoison is an extreme and not something most people would ever suggest
2014-08-05 10:31:13	superbia	had my own scripts, keybinds
2014-08-05 10:31:15	superbia	etc..
2014-08-05 10:31:33	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: what do you mean by sth?
2014-08-05 10:31:56	sinix	why did you switch from it superbia ?
2014-08-05 10:32:03	Eldunar	something... just when i looked on it first time i though that looks like windows;p
2014-08-05 10:32:20	superbia	sinix: well.. didnt have time to install it :)
2014-08-05 10:32:53	superbia	i mean... id have to get pure arch (with luks lvm it takes time)
2014-08-05 10:32:56	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: it is meant to feel like Windows...it doesnt look like windows at all but workflow is very similar for the purpose of being friendlier to Windows switchers
2014-08-05 10:33:10	superbia	and i have xfce working and im satisfied with xfce (after trying cinnamon and MATE and GNOME)
2014-08-05 10:33:20	superbia	and i dont want to change what works
2014-08-05 10:33:28	sinix	yeah i hear that
2014-08-05 10:33:40	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: I wouldn't tell people to use Cinnamon as new users alone...I would tell them to use Mint
2014-08-05 10:33:44	sinix	i use awesome primarily, but i keep GNOME "just in case"
2014-08-05 10:33:59	superbia	what is the most beautiful panel ????
2014-08-05 10:34:13	superbia	xfce4panel looks like it came from the 90-s
2014-08-05 10:34:29	Eldunar	emerald with compiz
2014-08-05 10:34:32	Eldunar	rule;p
2014-08-05 10:34:39	superbia	i want it to display proc/sensors and few shortcuts for favourite apps
2014-08-05 10:34:41	MichaelTunnell	compiz yucky
2014-08-05 10:35:07	Eldunar	startx
2014-08-05 10:35:11	Eldunar	sorry not here;p
2014-08-05 10:35:45	MichaelTunnell	superbia: you dont want to change what works...enjoy the kaos that will happen in about a year or two when Wayland takes over and X dies then everything that depends on X dies...such as XFCE
2014-08-05 10:36:00	superbia	wayland ???
2014-08-05 10:36:31	MichaelTunnell	sinix: GNOME has an extension called shell shape that is awesome...it is awesome, xmonad, i3, etc style tiling in GNOME
2014-08-05 10:36:34	MichaelTunnell	so nice
2014-08-05 10:36:44	MichaelTunnell	superbia: Wayland is the display server that will replace X
2014-08-05 10:37:22	MichaelTunnell	everything that depends on X will be obsolete and no longer work thus why XFCE is a joke because they seem to think they dont have to worry about it...even LXDE is addressing that
2014-08-05 10:38:22	MichaelTunnell	xfce panels is not what you change...replace the theme of the panel to make it look better, add the Whisker Menu, and modify the icons and that will fix XFCE hideousness
2014-08-05 10:39:43	superbia	well
2014-08-05 10:39:49	superbia	if i read correctly
2014-08-05 10:40:09	superbia	wayland will replace x and compositor with one thing
2014-08-05 10:41:02	superbia	?
2014-08-05 10:41:27	MichaelTunnell	wayland and weston
2014-08-05 10:41:39	MichaelTunnell	replaces Xorg completely
2014-08-05 10:41:52	MichaelTunnell	at first they will work together and then they will abandon Xorg
2014-08-05 10:42:21	MichaelTunnell	XFCE is the only DE that doesn't have a plan to address this issue so I mock it for being a joke because they have no idea what they are doing
2014-08-05 10:42:30	superbia	so
2014-08-05 10:42:46	superbia	wayland is a step closer to make linux useless
2014-08-05 10:42:46	MichaelTunnell	XFCE also makes updates so little it is ridiculous
2014-08-05 10:43:01	MichaelTunnell	superbia: lmao yea because of the one stupid DE wont work
2014-08-05 10:43:03	MichaelTunnell	sure
2014-08-05 10:43:17	superbia	u forget that the TWM's will still be usable under X
2014-08-05 10:43:35	MichaelTunnell	window managers can easily compensate for the switch
2014-08-05 10:43:43	MichaelTunnell	especially the tiling
2014-08-05 10:43:43	superbia	why switch
2014-08-05 10:44:09	MichaelTunnell	Xorg is a clunky mess and has been for pretty much always
2014-08-05 10:44:19	superbia	i wouldnt say..
2014-08-05 10:44:30	MichaelTunnell	you wouldnt say what
2014-08-05 10:44:42	superbia	was pertty configurable
2014-08-05 10:44:52	MichaelTunnell	what is
2014-08-05 10:44:58	superbia	x
2014-08-05 10:45:13	MichaelTunnell	configuration has nothing to do with being a mess or clunky...or not
2014-08-05 10:45:16	MichaelTunnell	the developers of xorg say it is a mess
2014-08-05 10:45:36	Eldunar	Sorry for interupt... but after Antergos Base i have system working but not configured?
2014-08-05 10:45:38	superbia	so what are the gains of wayland ???????
2014-08-05 10:45:51	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: you have a working arch system with no DE or WM
2014-08-05 10:46:10	MichaelTunnell	so you will have essentially a terminal...then you install the GUI you want and then it will feel like it is ready to go
2014-08-05 10:46:28	Eldunar	ok. So i have to install xorg and so one?:D Yeah, ill learn sth to start arching;p
2014-08-05 10:46:43	MichaelTunnell	I'm not going to list the gigantic amount of improvements because I dont want to type that much but there are a lot of articles and videos explaining it
2014-08-05 10:46:51	superbia	MichaelTunnell: ok
2014-08-05 10:47:06	superbia	MichaelTunnell: my ratpoison used 1MB ram, tell me what i would gain with wayland
2014-08-05 10:48:28	MichaelTunnell	you are asking a ridiculous question
2014-08-05 10:48:32	MichaelTunnell	superbia:
2014-08-05 10:48:36	superbia	ok
2014-08-05 10:49:00	MichaelTunnell	you are asking why a WM that doesnt benefit from X in almost any way why  it benefits from wayland...that is ridiculous
2014-08-05 10:49:28	MichaelTunnell	ratpoison could easily be modified for wayland so it doesnt matter
2014-08-05 10:49:49	MichaelTunnell	Eldunar: yes you might have xorg already in base I dont remember but you will need that and a de
2014-08-05 10:50:17	Eldunar	i installed that with mesa:) now i can install de:)

2014-08-06 01:30:54	Timothy_Hoxley	Hi uhm... the download links seem to be just pointing at "#" and not actually a file
2014-08-06 01:31:18	topkek32juan	[02:36:56] <LEDfan> Hey. I think the downloadlinks on your website are broken? [04:00:50] <topkek32juan> yeah they are LEDfan [04:27:25] <MichaelTunnell> unfortunately they are a bit
2014-08-06 01:32:06	Timothy_Hoxley	So it is not possible to grab the iso files at this time then
2014-08-06 01:32:50	Noxbru	Timothy_Hoxley: if you want the previous iso you can
2014-08-06 01:32:51	topkek32juan	http://sourceforge.net/projects/antergos/files/mirror/iso/release/
2014-08-06 01:32:56	topkek32juan	im not sure if these are the latest
2014-08-06 01:33:26	topkek32juan	ah nope
2014-08-06 01:33:28	topkek32juan	2014.08.04 is the latest
2014-08-06 01:33:35	Noxbru	topkek32juan: these are the previous one :)
2014-08-06 01:35:12	Timothy_Hoxley	well I don't think it matters that much since it just basically downloads the packages on install from the repos
2014-08-06 01:35:34	Noxbru	if I remember correctly, it matters if you want to install KDE
2014-08-06 01:35:46	Timothy_Hoxley	i am a cinnamon guy

2014-08-06 02:49:59	Noxbru	if you want, you can try using the previous one, but if I remember correctly, it had an issue with kde
2014-08-06 02:50:23	thl	Available when?
2014-08-06 02:50:43	Noxbru	I don't know, that's something that only the devs know

2014-08-06 03:54:31	superbia	yes
2014-08-06 03:54:44	superbia	but if antergos for example changes how "default" xfce looks
2014-08-06 03:55:36	Noxbru	that will only happen if they change one of the packages from the antergos repo and you have it installed, and it affects xfce looks
2014-08-06 03:55:48	superbia	k
2014-08-06 03:55:52	superbia	so its possible ?
2014-08-06 03:56:39	Noxbru	it is possible to do it, yes, on paper, it will happen? I don't know

2014-08-06 17:19:24	Noxbru	JacobGuy7800: the keyboard layout usually can be changed somewhere in the configuration tools
2014-08-06 17:19:34	kiioo	Hello Folks! I have Windows 8 installed on my computer, and I want to know if Antergos makes the dualboot automatic like ubuntu.
2014-08-06 17:19:58	JacobGuy7800	No, but its easy to get working
2014-08-06 17:20:08	kiioo	How can I do it, JacobGuy7800
2014-08-06 17:20:09	kiioo	?
2014-08-06 17:20:21	JacobGuy7800	Depends if you bought your computer with windows 8 or if it was upgraded from 7
2014-08-06 17:20:52	MichaelTunnell	JacobGuy7800: what DE do you use
2014-08-06 17:20:58	kiioo	I bought it with Windows 8
2014-08-06 17:21:08	JacobGuy7800	MichaelTunnell: XFCE
2014-08-06 17:21:26	JacobGuy7800	kiioo: It should be automatic
2014-08-06 17:21:56	kiioo	So if I install antergos in another partition, It'll work fine ?
2014-08-06 17:22:46	JacobGuy7800	kiioo: If it isnt then just mount your efi partition as read only and then identify the UEFI application. You can then edit the grub config to boot to that efi app.
2014-08-06 17:23:26	kiioo	Ok JacobGuy7800, thanks!
2014-08-06 17:23:59	JacobGuy7800	You're welcome
2014-08-06 17:24:36	JacobGuy7800	MichaelTunnell: I really need to get the keyboard fixed. I am using a french-canadian layout for some reason.
2014-08-06 17:25:06	JacobGuy7800	MichaelTunnell: Just tell me where to edit xorg.conf
2014-08-06 17:25:16	JacobGuy7800	Please

2014-08-06 17:43:03	MichaelTunnell	but install pavucontrol

2014-08-06 17:54:21	JacobGuy7800	I guess
2014-08-06 17:54:26	JacobGuy7800	But will they help?
2014-08-06 17:54:32	servergurus	Sorry, just got in here, what's the issue?
2014-08-06 17:54:37	JacobGuy7800	Or is it unsupported
2014-08-06 17:54:42	JacobGuy7800	Sound
2014-08-06 17:55:01	MichaelTunnell	they will help because Antergos is Arch. Manjaro and Chakra are not Arch but Antergos technically is
2014-08-06 17:55:23	servergurus	Wanna repaste the sound problem? Just out of curiosity?
2014-08-06 17:55:30	JacobGuy7800	Well, I can tell you that the Manjaro IRC is not helpful
2014-08-06 17:55:56	JacobGuy7800	Anyways, I have no sound, It's...not...making...noise.

2014-08-06 17:56:28	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro itself is not helpful so that makes sense

2014-08-06 17:57:13	JacobGuy7800	I am using a Gigabyte Z87 UD3H motherboard.

2014-08-06 18:00:10	Noxbru	JacobGuy7800's card seems to be a '8 series', if the '8' in the modules names refers to this, this may be the reason of having no sound

2014-08-06 18:16:55	Noxbru	for me, it says HDA Intel MID, and as chip a Realtek ALC272X
2014-08-06 18:17:06	Noxbru	in the link to Arch's wiki
2014-08-06 18:17:29	Noxbru	"There may be a problem with two conflicting modules loaded, namely snd-intel8x0 and snd-intel8x0m. In this case, blacklist snd-intel8x0m"
2014-08-06 18:17:43	MichaelTunnell	you wouldnt use HDMI unless you are using the HDMI cable to a HDMI speaker like in monitor speakers
2014-08-06 18:18:09	JacobGuy7800	Yeah
2014-08-06 18:18:18	JacobGuy7800	And I'm using seperate speakers

2014-08-07 08:36:50	kopfwackler	Gyrth_, use it if you want to boot using a classic BIOS.

2014-08-07 15:09:24	Gyrth	MichaelTunnell_, goes to show that not one DE has it right. But a combination.
2014-08-07 15:10:57	MichaelTunnell_	well not one has it right to some people :)
2014-08-07 15:12:26	MichaelTunnell_	so far I am really liking GNOME3 Gyrth
2014-08-07 15:13:28	Gyrth	MichaelTunnell_, ah yes me to. I've been using that for a while now. But switching between is something that bothers me.
2014-08-07 15:13:56	MichaelTunnell_	switching between what
2014-08-07 15:15:26	Gyrth	Oh haha. Windows.
2014-08-07 15:15:53	DGMurdockIII	MichaelTunnell_,  unity the game engine or unity the DE?
2014-08-07 15:16:02	Noxbru	Alt+tab and Alt+º works nicely in gnome-shell, and you can always use the super key
2014-08-07 15:16:05	Gyrth	MichaelTunnell_, DE
2014-08-07 15:27:58	MichaelTunnell_	switching windows is awesome in GNOME to me Gyrth because you can use a mouse or a keyboard and it is very fluid. Super plus wheel scrolling for workspaces then click a window or alt tab through any workspace...that is cool
2014-08-07 15:28:34	Gyrth	MichaelTunnell_, eh, too many moving parts for me.
2014-08-07 15:28:53	Noxbru	KDE has more moving parts I think :)
2014-08-07 15:28:57	MichaelTunnell_	alt+tab is literally the same in every DE lol
2014-08-07 15:29:27	MichaelTunnell_	plus in GNOME you can setup the Dash to Dock to work pretty much exactly like Unity launcher with active windows and such
2014-08-07 15:29:28	Noxbru	MichaelTunnell_: it isn't, in Gnome-Shell it goes over all apps, not over all windows
2014-08-07 15:30:38	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: there is an extension for that to change it to all windows not just apps
2014-08-07 15:31:00	Noxbru	I know, there's extensions for almost everything
2014-08-07 15:31:22	MichaelTunnell_	that is my point...defaults dont matter when GNOME allows users to do whatever they want via Extensions
2014-08-07 15:32:19	MichaelTunnell_	though the GNOME defaults are 90% great..just a few quirks that I dont like but all of them are customizable via Extensions...I admit I did have to modify some extensions to do exactly what I want but still fantastic solution
2014-08-07 15:32:19	Noxbru	they may matter if users don't know about this precise extension :)
2014-08-07 15:33:00	Noxbru	I think the same, although I liked more the old Alt+Tab behaviour
2014-08-07 15:33:06	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: they just go to the extension website...where you can install and test an extension from the website...check out the screenshot...read the descriptions...and some provide videos...I wish more provided videos but still
2014-08-07 15:34:05	MichaelTunnell_	I actually would contribute screencaps if there was a way to submit them but sadly there isn't
2014-08-07 15:35:09	MichaelTunnell_	I wish there was a way to better collaborate on an extension because some people stop working on them and then they are forked and only available via the comments...those are weird issues that the GNOME team should address
2014-08-07 15:36:01	Noxbru	yep, one of the extensions I used to use stopped developing at 3.8
2014-08-07 15:36:08	MichaelTunnell_	Quick Close Overview is a good example of such an extension...it is so convienent but the main one is out of date and easily fixed if you know how...but there is also a fork of it on Github that you have to find in the comments
2014-08-07 15:36:30	MichaelTunnell_	which extension are you referring to?
2014-08-07 15:36:31	Noxbru	don't know that extension... what does it do?
2014-08-07 15:36:35	Noxbru	system-monitor
2014-08-07 15:36:47	Noxbru	the one that shows  some stats in the top bar
2014-08-07 15:37:13	MichaelTunnell_	Super opens Overview...as you likely know...which gives you all apps in a nice grid which you can then close with the close button
2014-08-07 15:37:28	MichaelTunnell_	that sucks because you have to move your mouse to that button to kill it
2014-08-07 15:37:44	Noxbru	it's not as if it was a kilometer
2014-08-07 15:37:48	MichaelTunnell_	Quick Close Overview allows you to middle click or (or any button) on the window in Overview to kill it
2014-08-07 15:38:07	MichaelTunnell_	link me the extension please
2014-08-07 15:38:35	MichaelTunnell_	https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/352/middle-click-to-close-in-overview/
2014-08-07 15:38:52	MichaelTunnell_	that is the one I am talking about...there is a fork in the comments that is 3.12
2014-08-07 15:39:15	Noxbru	https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/120/system-monitor/ this is the one I used
2014-08-07 15:39:29	Noxbru	as a side note, it was also very RAM hungry

2014-08-07 19:50:07	Melon_Bread	Okay so I think I havea  grasp on what it is, just can not find anywhere to start on how to have it run locally on my machiene for thins like aria2
2014-08-07 19:54:49	MichaelTunnell_	are you using aria2 by itself?
2014-08-07 19:55:07	MichaelTunnell_	or integrated into something like uGet?
2014-08-07 19:56:01	MichaelTunnell_	Melon_Bread: ^
2014-08-07 19:56:49	Melon_Bread	by itself
2014-08-07 19:57:46	Melon_Bread	I want to use it to intergrate into chromium using an extention
2014-08-07 19:57:49	Melon_Bread	Yet every extention/addon asks for the JSON-RPC server
2014-08-07 19:57:52	Melon_Bread	I started aria2 with all of the correct params
2014-08-07 20:15:58	MichaelTunnell_	https://aria2.sourceforge.net/ has documentation for it
2014-08-07 20:16:05	MichaelTunnell_	however I would suggest trying out uGet
2014-08-07 20:16:21	MichaelTunnell_	uGet integrates with aria2 as a plugin
2014-08-07 20:17:09	MichaelTunnell_	it also works with Chromium via a Clipboard Monitor and we are currently working on uGet Extension for Chromium which will provide context menu integrations and such as well.
2014-08-07 20:17:15	MichaelTunnell_	http://ugetdm.com
2014-08-07 20:17:31	MichaelTunnell_	disclaimer: I am a project member for uGet so I may be a bit biased. :)
2014-08-07 20:19:21	MichaelTunnell_	uGet has simple integration with aria2...all you have to do is enable the plugin and you're done. The JSON-RPC stuff is done automatically for you

2014-08-08 00:38:24	Guest53448	MichaelTunnell_: is there a way to install just gnome? no extra packages
2014-08-08 00:39:19	MichaelTunnell_	that doesnt make sense...you will only be installing GNOME and only its dependencies.
2014-08-08 00:39:34	MichaelTunnell_	unless you are asking of a fresh install of Antergos via the GUI
2014-08-08 00:39:38	Guest53448	oh okay
2014-08-08 00:39:42	Guest53448	i thought it was like ubuntu
2014-08-08 00:39:44	Guest53448	with the package
2014-08-08 00:39:47	MichaelTunnell_	then that would be different
2014-08-08 00:39:57	MichaelTunnell_	you already have Antergos installed dont you?
2014-08-08 00:40:14	Guest53448	yes
2014-08-08 00:40:34	MichaelTunnell_	you can just install GNOME via the pacman tool from the main repo
2014-08-08 00:40:47	MichaelTunnell_	but if you plan on doing a fresh install of Antergos then the answer is different
2014-08-08 00:41:51	MichaelTunnell_	the Antergos GUI comes with predefined apps with all of the DEs but if you dont want that and just want Antergos installed with just the DE then you just select "Base" as the option to install instead of a DE and then you use pacman to install GNOME via command line.
2014-08-08 00:42:02	MichaelTunnell_	then you would only have the bare essentials of Arch and GNOME.
2014-08-08 00:42:31	MichaelTunnell_	but if you already have Antergos you dont have to do that...though I dont know how well Cinnamon and GNOME work together but I think they do so fairly well.
2014-08-08 00:42:48	MichaelTunnell_	not together but as in both being installed. I think Unity is the only one that is picky about that
2014-08-08 00:44:03	Guest53448	thanks and when i want to remove gnome ?
2014-08-08 00:44:05	Guest53448	pacman -R gnome?
2014-08-08 00:44:29	MichaelTunnell_	IF you do not when :)
2014-08-08 00:44:31	MichaelTunnell_	and yes
2014-08-08 00:44:38	MichaelTunnell_	well not exactly just gnome
2014-08-08 00:45:35	MichaelTunnell_	are you 64bit or 32bit?
2014-08-08 00:46:16	MichaelTunnell_	meh it is the same command for either but was going to link you...here is the 64
2014-08-08 00:46:16	MichaelTunnell_	https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gnome-desktop/
2014-08-08 00:46:20	Guest53448	64bit
2014-08-08 00:46:23	MichaelTunnell_	you can see the dependencies there
2014-08-08 00:46:32	Guest53448	ty!
2014-08-08 00:49:08	MichaelTunnell_	Guest53448: welcome
2014-08-08 00:50:15	MichaelTunnell_	Guest53448: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/cinnamon-desktop/
2014-08-08 00:50:52	MichaelTunnell_	there you can see the Cinnamon dependencies...since Cinnamon is based on GNOME you'll see that you will already have some of the dependencies.

2014-08-08 00:54:31	Elisse	hello
2014-08-08 00:54:42	Elisse	anyone here at this time
2014-08-08 00:55:41	MichaelTunnell_	Elisse: indeed
2014-08-08 00:56:38	Elisse	MichaelTunnell_,  I have a little problem how do I uninstall a program that I installed locally
2014-08-08 00:57:11	Elisse	I downloaded no-ip client but now I see that it it on the pacman
2014-08-08 00:57:37	Elisse	and I will like to uninstall it and install the one on the repos
2014-08-08 00:58:00	Elisse	I used make..... make install
2014-08-08 00:58:09	MichaelTunnell_	ahh you compiled it
2014-08-08 00:58:15	Elisse	yes
2014-08-08 00:58:35	Elisse	but it won't make an uninstall
2014-08-08 00:58:57	Elisse	this is the file
2014-08-08 00:59:01	Elisse	noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
2014-08-08 00:59:33	MichaelTunnell_	does the package have an uninstall file in it?
2014-08-08 00:59:53	MichaelTunnell_	if you want me to look in the package please provide a link
2014-08-08 01:00:11	Elisse	ok
2014-08-08 01:00:36	Elisse	https://www.noip.com/download?page=linux
2014-08-08 01:01:43	MichaelTunnell_	so you did try make uninstall?
2014-08-08 01:02:24	Elisse	yes I did make uninstall as root
2014-08-08 01:02:45	Elisse	this I get bash: uninstall: command not found
2014-08-08 01:03:58	Elisse	or maybe you could help I want to auto start it at boot, but I don't find the init folder
2014-08-08 01:04:38	MichaelTunnell_	the make uninstall is not there
2014-08-08 01:04:45	MichaelTunnell_	I would just remove the files manually
2014-08-08 01:04:58	Elisse	but where did they installed?
2014-08-08 01:05:02	MichaelTunnell_	it looks like it should have files in...
2014-08-08 01:06:41	Elisse	this is where it is
2014-08-08 01:06:45	Elisse	/usr/local/bin/noip2
2014-08-08 01:06:57	MichaelTunnell_	that is just where the bin is
2014-08-08 01:07:07	MichaelTunnell_	there should also be in .config/noip2
2014-08-08 01:07:21	Elisse	ok
2014-08-08 01:07:29	Elisse	so I just delete both files
2014-08-08 01:07:56	MichaelTunnell_	yea and also might have something in opt/www/
2014-08-08 01:08:03	Elisse	ok
2014-08-08 01:08:09	Elisse	I'll chech
2014-08-08 01:08:10	MichaelTunnell_	and
2014-08-08 01:08:13	MichaelTunnell_	usr/bin
2014-08-08 01:08:14	Elisse	right now
2014-08-08 01:08:19	MichaelTunnell_	and usr/etc
2014-08-08 01:08:39	MichaelTunnell_	sorry
2014-08-08 01:08:45	Elisse	its ok
2014-08-08 01:08:53	MichaelTunnell_	usr/local/etc
2014-08-08 01:09:08	MichaelTunnell_	not usr/bin I read the makefile wrong
2014-08-08 01:09:29	MichaelTunnell_	then that should be it
2014-08-08 01:09:48	Elisse	ok
2014-08-08 01:10:13	MichaelTunnell_	also in the future when you want to compile from source that isnt in Arch Repo or AUR then you should use makepkg as it will use pacman to do a make install....which means it can use pacman to uninstall it
2014-08-08 01:10:23	MichaelTunnell_	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg
2014-08-08 01:10:46	Elisse	good to know, I will do that next time

2014-08-08 01:24:47	Elisse	I am doing it
2014-08-08 01:39:10	Elisse	its done, I did it
2014-08-08 01:39:25	Noxbru	congrats, Elisse!
2014-08-08 01:40:05	Elisse	yayy
2014-08-08 01:40:53	MichaelTunnell_	Elisse: great!
2014-08-08 01:40:54	Noxbru	btw, what were you doing?
2014-08-08 01:41:18	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: removing a compiled package and adding the repo version via pacman
2014-08-08 01:41:24	Elisse	yes
2014-08-08 01:41:59	Noxbru	ah, interesting :) the built package with a PKGBUILD or using its own installation process?
2014-08-08 01:42:50	Elisse	using it's own
2014-08-08 01:43:02	Elisse	a mistake that I won't make again
2014-08-08 01:43:36	Noxbru	no doubt, if Arch gives you a package, you use it, or ABS at least
2014-08-08 01:44:40	Elisse	yes I tried to install with command but it said that package didn't existed
2014-08-08 01:45:10	Elisse	so I downloaded a tar.gz file and copiled it
2014-08-08 01:45:33	Elisse	and then I openned packman and I saw it on the aur
2014-08-08 01:45:42	Elisse	but it was late
2014-08-08 01:45:48	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: even if arch or AUR doesnt have a package, regular compile is not a good idea as makepkg exists :)

2014-08-08 01:46:25	Noxbru	yes, but it may be a bit tricky to make a new pkgbuild... I don't know if I would know how to do one, honestly
2014-08-08 01:46:30	MichaelTunnell_	thats what I do...like a Linux Anti-Hero
2014-08-08 01:46:30	Elisse	now everything is ok
2014-08-08 01:46:50	Elisse	hahahaha, tes
2014-08-08 01:46:53	Elisse	yes
2014-08-08 01:46:56	Noxbru	then, everything is good, and the order is restored (or something like that)
2014-08-08 01:47:01	Elisse	yes
2014-08-08 01:47:07	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: it isnt that hard...you can just use a default example and put the regular make install stuff in the build function and bam makepkg is ready
2014-08-08 01:48:01	MichaelTunnell_	it doesnt need to be a complicated pkgbuild...a simple build function of the normal make install actions works enough for makepkg
2014-08-08 01:49:06	Noxbru	I guess that using some other simple package as an example it won't be difficult

2014-08-08 02:36:35	Pic	Sorry if it's not the place for newbie questions: I'm trying to install Antergos alongside Mint. While choosing partitions there is a mount checklist which says that I haven't picked my /boot partition. How exactly do I do that? I picked one, clicked twice, selected /boot as mount point but I still can't advance
2014-08-08 02:38:06	MichaelTunnell_	Pic: sounds as though you set the mount point but forgot to apply the mount point
2014-08-08 02:38:12	MichaelTunnell_	you are likely using GParted right?
2014-08-08 02:38:37	Pic	I'm using the Graphical Installer via Live CD
2014-08-08 02:39:41	Pic	so how do I apply the mount point exactly?
2014-08-08 02:42:50	MichaelTunnell_	then you are using GParted...once you make changes, at the top toolbar you will see a grey button turn active and that is to apply changes
2014-08-08 02:43:01	MichaelTunnell_	toolbar buttons, far right button
2014-08-08 02:43:58	Pic	You mean the arrow buttons used to advance and go back? The right arrow button is still grayed out
2014-08-08 02:44:40	Pic	I have swap, I have mount point "/" and mount point "/boot"
2014-08-08 02:44:45	MichaelTunnell_	the far right button is like a return arrow...it looks like the same you will see on your enter button
2014-08-08 02:45:09	MichaelTunnell_	are you using an existing /home?
2014-08-08 02:45:59	MichaelTunnell_	there might be a dropdown on the bottom left that does boot
2014-08-08 02:46:05	MichaelTunnell_	I dont remember how the GUI is setup
2014-08-08 02:46:13	MichaelTunnell_	I think it is there though
2014-08-08 02:46:18	Pic	I don't but on Linux Mint I only used "/" and home was on the same partition, I simply backed it up on external drive, is it not enough?
2014-08-08 02:47:15	MichaelTunnell_	separating /home from / allows for easy fresh installs as your documents, media, settings, etc wont be touched
2014-08-08 02:47:32	MichaelTunnell_	I always suggest /home if the user is willing to learn what that means
2014-08-08 02:47:53	MichaelTunnell_	 /home be separate I mean
2014-08-08 02:48:04	MichaelTunnell_	I'm sure there are some tutorials on youtube for doing that
2014-08-08 02:48:20	Pic	unfortunately I see nothing as what you describe, there's no button with an enter icon, only arrow left, arrow right, and "x" for exit.
2014-08-08 02:48:31	MichaelTunnell_	but if you did this then you need a /home for each mint and antergos as they are nothing alike
2014-08-08 02:48:34	Pic	Hm, maybe you're right, for now I'll just install it and see if I can get it to work correctly, I have all my documents backed up for now
2014-08-08 02:48:38	MichaelTunnell_	well not nothing but different enough
2014-08-08 02:48:58	Pic	right, sorry
2014-08-08 02:49:46	MichaelTunnell_	I dont know then off the top of my head I would need a screenshot or something but unfortunately it is almost 5am and I need to get some sleep so I can't help anymore now...maybe someone else can jump in...if not I will be back tomorrow

2014-08-08 21:57:24	MichaelTunnell	conflict with what
2014-08-08 21:57:54	ahoneybun	lib32-nvidia-libgl" and "lib32-nvidia-utils"  with mesa
2014-08-08 21:58:57	ahoneybun	when installing the nvidia packages it wants to remove the mesa packages
2014-08-08 21:59:33	MichaelTunnell	ahoneybun: yes and you need to remove them
2014-08-08 21:59:55	ahoneybun	the wiki says that we can do -nodeps to remove the conflict
2014-08-08 22:00:15	MichaelTunnell	there is no need to really have those with the nvidia packages
2014-08-08 22:00:25	MichaelTunnell	I removed them
2014-08-08 22:01:07	ahoneybun	I think the last time I did that I was not able to get to the login
2014-08-08 22:01:52	ahoneybun	Select "Execute" and then "Install Options" and select "-nodeps" to prevent conflicts
2014-08-08 22:02:58	MichaelTunnell	you were not able to login? did it get to the login screen or crash with a message like a GNOME message?
2014-08-08 22:03:49	ahoneybun	don't remember
2014-08-08 22:03:59	ahoneybun	well I guess I could try again
2014-08-08 22:04:24	MichaelTunnell	if it is a GNOME message it could be an issue with the drivers and the kernel...that happens sometimes

2014-08-08 22:08:15	ahoneybun	nice work devs!
2014-08-08 22:09:10	MichaelTunnell	that is more of an arch related thing but yes they did well
2014-08-08 22:09:39	ahoneybun	I love that the wallpaper changes after every reboot in the live usb
2014-08-08 22:09:52	ahoneybun	also why does gnome videos does not play mp4?
2014-08-08 22:09:59	MichaelTunnell	ahoneybun: you can make the login screen do that as well when you install it
2014-08-08 22:10:12	MichaelTunnell	you need h264 codec support
2014-08-08 22:11:11	MichaelTunnell	when you install via Antergos Live USB it will ask you if you want to install those and it will do it automatically
2014-08-08 22:12:41	MichaelTunnell	but you can install the x264 package to make it work
2014-08-08 22:13:49	MichaelTunnell	libx264 is need as well but the x264 package should pull that in too
2014-08-08 22:14:24	ahoneybun	I have to use vlc to play my mp4s I would like to use videos
2014-08-08 22:14:39	ahoneybun	oh sorry did not see that
2014-08-08 22:17:07	ahoneybun	I have libx264 is installed but can't find x264
2014-08-08 22:17:48	ahoneybun	I see it
2014-08-08 22:19:02	ahoneybun	still will not play it
2014-08-08 22:26:47	MichaelTunnell	I used to like totem but I dont like it more
2014-08-08 22:26:57	MichaelTunnell	any more
2014-08-08 22:27:09	MichaelTunnell	the latest version of totem has been too messed up
2014-08-08 22:27:15	MichaelTunnell	so I use mpv now
2014-08-08 22:29:20	MichaelTunnell	but mpv is kind of an extensive app as you have to figure out the command line options for it
2014-08-08 22:29:22	MichaelTunnell	but I really like it

2014-08-09 10:11:53	nim__	Hi, is it possible to install multiple preconfigured DE's through the package manager? Let's say I chose KDE on during my installation of Antergos and I then want to install Gnome. If I just install Gnome through pacman it comes without all the themes and configuration etc. Is there a, for example, Gnome-Antergos package or something?
2014-08-09 10:12:17	Noxbru	hi nim__, as far as I know no
2014-08-09 10:12:25	Noxbru	sorry
2014-08-09 10:13:07	nim__	Noxbru, thank you :)
2014-08-09 10:13:44	nim__	Noxbru if I may ask, which DE do you use yourself? I can't really decide... I use i3 myself but also want a more "graphical" DE on the side but can't pick
2014-08-09 10:14:06	Noxbru	I use gnome-shell, but that's what I have used 'always'

2014-08-09 10:37:30	antergos-test	hi, i donwloaded the latest ISO but cnchi does not launch when i wanted to install it , is it me only or did someone also noted this? btw the md5sum of my downloaded and burned cd are exact match to the official md5sums
2014-08-09 10:39:08	antergos-test	can someone confirm this issue please?

2014-08-09 10:40:57	Noxbru	hi antergos-test maybe you can launch cnchi from the terminal?
2014-08-09 10:41:20	Noxbru	MichaelTunnell: I suppose that it would depend on the kind of packages :)
2014-08-09 10:42:04	antergos-test	i tried and it crashes with no output to know what causes cnchi to crash
2014-08-09 10:42:28	Noxbru	no output at all, even in the terminal? that's very strange...
2014-08-09 10:42:55	Noxbru	I'm not one of the devs, so I think that the best thing you can do is report your problem in the forums, sorry
2014-08-09 10:43:51	antergos-test	the previous iso worked fine so im looking for the previous iso , guess cnchi got broken in the lastest iso somehow
2014-08-09 10:48:32	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: kernel, gpu drivers, qt, virtualbox, mesa, and a lot of other core packages :)
2014-08-09 10:48:58	Noxbru	kernel is once a week or so, so you are good with it
2014-08-09 10:49:32	Noxbru	antergos-test: what date you are refering to?
2014-08-09 10:49:37	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: the packages themselves is not the potential...it is them all together
2014-08-09 10:49:56	MichaelTunnell	antergos-test: I think there is a version in sourceforge for a July build
2014-08-09 10:50:14	Noxbru	antergos-test: I know of a server with the june iso
2014-08-09 10:50:28	Noxbru	MichaelTunnell: What Could Go Wrong!? :)
2014-08-09 10:56:19	antergos-test	Noxbru: the latest iso on wbsite i.e  antergos-2014.08.06-i686.iso - 73184ac0d955366b653fa96348dd2176 MD5 64-bits
2014-08-09 10:56:55	antergos-test	http://antergos.com/try-it/  from here
2014-08-09 10:57:31	antergos-test	this is the latest one, the one from june on this main page worked fine but not this current  one
2014-08-09 11:01:24	Noxbru	I know, but I know of a mirror that hasn't been  updated yet
2014-08-09 11:02:56	antergos-test	pass me the link please and yes this iso has issue, others have also reported this issue about cnchi forum http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2075
2014-08-09 11:03:47	Noxbru	antergos-test: thoses issues are old, a new iso was made after
2014-08-09 11:03:55	Noxbru	http://softlibre.unizar.es/cinnarch/iso/release/
2014-08-09 11:05:41	antergos-test	but still the installer is broken which is an issue with cnchi frequently, anyways thanks for the link i will download the previous old working iso

2014-08-09 17:13:00	MichaelTunnell	topkek32Juan: I was just kidding somewhat...openbox is very limited in what it can do visually so you will need to search for some tutorials
2014-08-09 17:14:30	MichaelTunnell	ahoneybun: lxde is good when you have to have lightness and dont care about features...xfce is basically just a clunky mess that way too many people suggest that I dont understand why they do it. MATE is a good choice though however Cinnamon is actually very lightweight and is only about 10% more than XFCE
2014-08-09 17:15:12	ahoneybun	MichaelTunnell: Cinnamon is pretty nice

2014-08-09 17:23:00	MichaelTunnell	ahoneybun: Pantheon is crap for everyone but elemenaryOS but unfortunately eOS is crap for a distro so their DE is ruined because of that
2014-08-09 17:23:15	MichaelTunnell	because unfortunately*
2014-08-09 17:23:29	ahoneybun	MichaelTunnell: why would you say that?
2014-08-09 17:23:32	MichaelTunnell	I wish Pantheon was not dependent on eOS because eOS is crap
2014-08-09 17:23:57	ahoneybun	I know that it is bad because of it being based on ubuntu?
2014-08-09 17:24:02	MichaelTunnell	they update the distro once every 2 years so all packages in eOS repo are absurdly out of date
2014-08-09 17:24:17	MichaelTunnell	it is not bad for base on Ubuntu...Ubuntu is a great base
2014-08-09 17:25:23	MichaelTunnell	the eOS team basically dont address any issues that Ubuntu based derivative would encounter and then adds their own issues on top of that making their distro crap...it isn't the worst distro but I would never recommend it to anyone
2014-08-09 17:26:32	MichaelTunnell	the version of my app in their distro is almost 3 years old...so yea I don't like eOS at all...what is worse the developers have no idea how to address this problem and won't allow developers to have any control over the apps in their repo...so it is a purgatory of apps
2014-08-09 17:28:44	MichaelTunnell	Ubuntu's 6 months update for apps is bad enough...2 years is just completely unacceptable.
2014-08-09 17:29:18	MichaelTunnell	I am an Antergos/Arch user but that doesn't mean I hate Ubuntu...in fact there are many things I like them for and many things people complain about that are unjustified
2014-08-09 17:38:07	ahoneybun	MichaelTunnell: would it not help having their own repos? not simple ppas
2014-08-09 17:38:12	ahoneybun	like how Linux Mint does?
2014-08-09 17:39:16	MichaelTunnell	ahoneybun: they dont even use ppas...and they dont have the capacity to have their own repo so no it would not work
2014-08-09 17:39:41	MichaelTunnell	Mint has a bunch of people helping and they have financial sponsors so they can actually do it but eOS has neither
2014-08-09 17:39:58	ahoneybun	I see and I would think it does not help anymore with their patches on top of ubuntu packages

2014-08-10 09:46:57	superbia	so....
2014-08-10 09:47:01	superbia	now when i got that working
2014-08-10 09:47:09	superbia	can i use pacman -Syu firefox
2014-08-10 09:47:12	superbia	to install firefox ?
2014-08-10 09:47:25	superbia	can i use pacman -Syu firefox opera chromium
2014-08-10 09:47:59	arshavin	if you can run twm wm then you are good to go

2014-08-10 09:55:55	superbia	262MB ram so far..
2014-08-10 09:56:19	arshavin	building a lightweight system?
2014-08-10 09:58:22	arshavin	mine is around 600MB on mate
2014-08-10 09:58:51	superbia	arshavin: right...
2014-08-10 09:59:12	superbia	i got to check old configs, refurbish them and git them
2014-08-10 09:59:16	superbia	for future uses
2014-08-10 09:59:37	superbia	also remove nasty configs, and use the most of default keybindings
2014-08-10 10:00:28	arshavin	I have stayed on antergos really long now,and I don't feel like going anywhere
2014-08-10 10:00:43	arshavin	quite happy with it
2014-08-10 10:00:54	superbia	mate is good
2014-08-10 10:00:58	superbia	but wastes pixels :)
2014-08-10 10:01:33	superbia	i mean, its good to install on your parents pc-s, and neighbours, or whenever one is tired of windows..
2014-08-10 10:01:44	superbia	but for me, i find antergos base really good..
2014-08-10 10:01:51	arshavin	yeah,hopefully they will get things right in new release,as of now I think of it as being a ba clone of gnome2
2014-08-10 10:02:00	arshavin	bad
2014-08-10 10:02:16	superbia	well, mostly because the encryption :) i like that it works rotb
2014-08-10 10:02:28	superbia	right out the box :)
2014-08-10 10:02:43	Noxbru	arshavin: it's hard to not be a clone of gnome2 when Mate is a fork of gnome2 ;)
2014-08-10 10:02:44	arshavin	I hardly use any encryption so not a real issue for me
2014-08-10 10:03:23	superbia	yep..
2014-08-10 10:03:40	arshavin	Noxbru, No I said a bad clone,because,though it's not their fault cos gtk itself has evolved a lot recently
2014-08-10 10:03:42	superbia	Noxbru: what are benifits of antergos repo, if we use the base installation
2014-08-10 10:04:06	Noxbru	superbia: yaourt, I think...
2014-08-10 10:04:25	arshavin	and numix themes,icons
2014-08-10 10:04:31	arshavin	lol
2014-08-10 10:04:45	Noxbru	do they have a theme for the terminal too? :)
2014-08-10 10:04:57	superbia	:D
2014-08-10 10:05:07	superbia	well il leave it right there...........
2014-08-10 10:05:07	arshavin	I haven't seen one
2014-08-10 10:05:12	superbia	no harm can come from antergos repo..
2014-08-10 10:05:21	 *	superbia draws that words back..
2014-08-10 10:05:25	Noxbru	arshavin: that's true, gtk3 has evolved much... hopefully it will get better
2014-08-10 10:05:37	superbia	clear
2014-08-10 10:05:41	superbia	fk
2014-08-10 10:06:55	arshavin	Noxbru, that is the reason why mate hasn't really completely cloned gnome2,nevertheless,since 1.10 will be based on gtk3,it will be interesting to see where it goes
2014-08-10 10:09:48	arshavin	ubuntu had the best gnome2 implementation prior to unity
2014-08-10 10:09:57	Noxbru	yep, but I'm more worried about using gtk3 in other desktops
2014-08-10 10:10:04	Noxbru	like kde, and its integration
2014-08-10 10:10:32	arshavin	Some of the things gnome3 devs are doing seem like crazy

2014-08-10 10:11:15	arshavin	they really don't care about the world anymore,it seems they only think about their own project rather than the whole linux community
2014-08-10 10:14:14	Noxbru	I don't know too... hopefully, when they 'finish' the project they have for gtk3 and gnome-shell they will start integration with outside
2014-08-10 10:14:58	arshavin	Who knows,I don't trust them,they don't seem to care about the community anymore
2014-08-10 10:18:55	Noxbru	I am worried... I have used gnome always, and I kind of like it. But when somebody asks me for a framework to develop a gui, I always suggest qt

2014-08-10 15:47:28	MichaelTunnell	spaceninja: yes and no
2014-08-10 15:47:56	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is just a easier installer of Arch yes so you will essentially have genuine Arch
2014-08-10 15:48:20	MichaelTunnell	the no comes from not all packages come from the official repos...some come from the AUR.
2014-08-10 15:48:52	MichaelTunnell	the AUR is user generated package build scripts so you have to be careful as they are not always going to be tested scripts
2014-08-10 15:49:14	spaceninja	ok, sounds good to me
2014-08-10 15:49:29	spaceninja	MichaelTunnell: thx
2014-08-10 15:49:38	MichaelTunnell	if it is in the official repos then they will be tested fairly well
2014-08-10 15:50:11	MichaelTunnell	just the AUR is the ony that doesnt get that treatment.
2014-08-10 15:50:13	Noxbru	but it's still possible that it may have bugs, don't forget this
2014-08-10 15:50:51	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: it is possible for any thing on any system for any purpose to have bugs
2014-08-10 15:50:59	MichaelTunnell	bugs are kind of expected
2014-08-10 15:51:03	MichaelTunnell	at some point
2014-08-10 15:51:35	Noxbru	sure, I was talking about the packages from the stable repos. They are almost always stable, but at some point there may be some strange bug
2014-08-10 15:54:20	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: certainly but I wouldnt say almost always though...all kinds of stuff can happen with any distro...Arch users just get access to them quicker than anyone else so we see them more often and before anyone else
2014-08-10 15:54:52	MichaelTunnell	in a way all Arch or Antergos users are kind of Beta Testers for Linux. :)
2014-08-10 15:55:35	Noxbru	you are absolutely right :)

2014-08-10 16:23:44	MichaelTunnell	I have asked you what you are trying to do and on what but you just respond in broad general terms that answer nothing

2014-08-10 16:27:04	MichaelTunnell	you didnt give the specs or model
2014-08-10 16:27:16	MichaelTunnell	you said tablet and computer but never a model or brand

If you hide a chat temporarily, the chat will remain active till you unhide it. If you want to remove a channel completely, for example because you entered it accidentially and it does not exist, do the following: Select the channel, right-click, choose Part -> Delete Chat(s)... -> Yes.

2014-08-16 06:05:59	wardhan	if i download iso, which de can i install ? i mean does it give options for des ?
2014-08-16 06:07:32	superbia	u are prompted yes
2014-08-16 06:07:37	superbia	u can select
2014-08-16 06:07:51	superbia	base, xfce, cinnamon, mate, KDE, gnome
2014-08-16 06:11:27	wardhan	superbia: thanks for clarifying. the iso size has got me thinking about the de available. distrowatch says gnome3 & scraed stiff about it. i am wondering about "one custom package repository.". can i install packages from arch & aur simultaneoulsy.
2014-08-16 06:13:13	superbia	wardhan: liveiso is on gnome3
2014-08-16 06:13:30	superbia	u run chcni, and chcnhi prompts u which DE u want to install
2014-08-16 06:13:36	superbia	now about repositories
2014-08-16 06:13:47	superbia	u have pure arch repos + one side repo from Antergos
2014-08-16 06:13:57	superbia	on Antergos are themes and configs for installation
2014-08-16 06:14:39	superbia	so if u use arch and AUR as u used to (like a real arch), u will never use Antergos side repo, because its mostly used during installation for themes/configs/icons etc.

2014-08-16 06:16:08	wardhan	until yesterday, i was using manjaro. today i tried to install arch but it beyond my reach. i need another system with an active internet connection to read & install myself.
2014-08-16 06:16:37	superbia	look no more
2014-08-16 06:16:41	wardhan	so i will right away download & install today itself.

2014-08-17 09:47:39	chrislp	Hi guys. I'm having terrible screen tearing in KDE using the newest NVIDIA proprietary drivers. Have anyone else experienced this? Can it be fixed?
2014-08-17 09:48:48	superbia	<ati
2014-08-17 09:48:53	superbia	<- ati
2014-08-17 09:48:57	superbia	only :)
2014-08-17 09:49:31	chrislp	That's of course one solution but not one for my wallet currently :(
2014-08-17 09:50:04	superbia	ati is cheaper
2014-08-17 09:50:45	chrislp	Yeah, but I can't afford a new GPU right now
2014-08-17 09:51:17	superbia	i am willing to trade my one
2014-08-17 09:51:20	superbia	for the nvidia
2014-08-17 09:51:40	chrislp	What?
2014-08-17 09:53:05	dmnmsc	chrislp: Try playing with desktop effects. In advanced tab you can change openlg version, switch native/raster etc. Also, you can prevent vsync effect enabling it in the same taab
2014-08-17 09:54:15	chrislp	dmnmsc: I've tried just about every single setting there :\
2014-08-17 09:55:15	dmnmsc	chrislp: then I have no idea, sorry. Using intel here.
2014-08-17 09:55:30	<--	satshow (~fred@dhcp-077-248-144-137.chello.nl) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2014-08-17 09:57:03	dmnmsc	chrislp: do you have the tearing issue when desktop effects are disabled?
2014-08-17 09:57:15	chrislp	Yes, it's the same
2014-08-17 09:59:05	dmnmsc	chrislp: do you have a  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf file?
2014-08-17 09:59:23	chrislp	Nope
2014-08-17 10:00:17	dmnmsc	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Avoid_screen_tearing_in_KDE_.28KWin.29
2014-08-17 10:01:03	chrislp	I've tried those fixes in /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh     do you want me to put it into a /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf file?
2014-08-17 10:01:08	dmnmsc	seems you need to create (or modify it's already created) a kwin.sh file (as sudo) and type there: export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP"
2014-08-17 10:01:27	chrislp	Yeah, tried that, didn't work :(
2014-08-17 10:01:39	dmnmsc	Also the KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1 option?
2014-08-17 10:01:57	chrislp	Yes, no difference. I've also tried various settings in the nvidia-settings
2014-08-17 10:02:31	dmnmsc	Then create the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf file and set tripplebufffer option
2014-08-17 10:03:31	chrislp	just "KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1", nothing more in the file?
2014-08-17 10:04:17	dmnmsc	no no, the kwin_triple_buffer is for kwin.sh. the 20-nvidia.conf needs a different options
2014-08-17 10:04:25	dmnmsc	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Minimal_configuration
2014-08-17 10:04:38	dmnmsc	And Option "TripleBuffer" "1"    before EndSection
2014-08-17 10:05:10	chrislp	I have an xorg.conf file that looks like this. Is this the same kind of file or is it unrelated?
2014-08-17 10:05:41	dmnmsc	Can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
2014-08-17 10:06:22	chrislp	http://pastebin.com/hfhyRP5z
2014-08-17 10:07:05	dmnmsc	chrislp: just paste the "Section "Device" options
2014-08-17 10:07:18	dmnmsc	and try changing Option "TripleBuffer" "True" by         Option "TripleBuffer" "1"
2014-08-17 10:07:29	dmnmsc	but seems you are already using trupleBuffer option.
2014-08-17 10:08:00	dmnmsc	chrislp: please note your system won't boot if something is wrong in 20-intel.conf. If this happens, just remove the file from another tty
2014-08-17 10:08:16	dmnmsc	20-nvidia.conf in your case :)
2014-08-17 10:08:53	chrislp	Alright, I'll paste the device section into 20-nvidia.conf :) Be back in a moment. Thanks
2014-08-17 10:09:08	dmnmsc	remember to change the "true" to "1"
2014-08-17 10:09:13	chrislp	And that too yes
2014-08-17 10:09:14	dmnmsc	but I guess nothing will change...
2014-08-17 10:09:31	dmnmsc	chrislp: Do you know how to remove a file by cli, true?
2014-08-17 10:09:39	chrislp	Yes
2014-08-17 10:09:51	dmnmsc	then no problem

2014-08-17 18:46:28	MichaelTunnell	but you should look into passwd as that should be able to do it but I havent had to so I am not sure exactly what needs to be done
2014-08-17 18:49:30	Aethysius	Don't you need sudo permissions?
2014-08-17 18:59:06	MichaelTunnell	in liveusb you automatically have root but you would still need to invoke it
2014-08-17 18:59:18	MichaelTunnell	liveusb are always setup as root for demoing and such
2014-08-17 19:00:01	Aethysius	I need to be sudo in order to make a LiveUSB.
2014-08-17 19:01:10	MichaelTunnell	you should just burn a dvd of something then and then make the liveusb from the cd
2014-08-17 19:01:18	MichaelTunnell	then you would have sudo rights via the cd
2014-08-17 19:01:30	Aethysius	Eh...
2014-08-17 19:01:41	MichaelTunnell	and you dont need to mount anything as long as the device is detectable in the livecd
2014-08-17 19:02:06	MichaelTunnell	actually with dd the device shouldnt be mounted anyway
2014-08-17 19:02:35	Aethysius	How would I make a LiveUSB from the LiveDVD?
2014-08-17 19:05:50	MichaelTunnell	you load the livedvd like normal and then you have root access...and you would just use dd from there
2014-08-17 19:06:21	Aethysius	So, dd <DVD> to <USB>?
2014-08-17 19:06:24	MichaelTunnell	you can install dd from livedvd it will go to your ram and wont be saved but it will work\
2014-08-17 19:06:58	MichaelTunnell	yea Aethysius you should be able to do that but if you have two usb you can move the file to the other sub and then do dd from the dvd via usb to usb
2014-08-17 19:07:06	MichaelTunnell	funky way but should work

2014-08-21 17:44:08	gman1985	it does not install because xorg 1.16 is still there

2014-08-21 17:45:02	gman1985	no
2014-08-21 17:45:25	gman1985	its at the bottom with the catalyst repo

2014-08-22 09:43:42	patahel	hi, i have a big problem: i cant boot from usb or cd, it allways stops after it tries to mount the ANTERGOS disk
2014-08-22 09:43:58	patahel	(and yes i copied the iso via dd
2014-08-22 09:44:52	Noxbru	hi, patahel, does it complains about anything else?
2014-08-22 09:45:19	Noxbru	enzro: if you mean, installing linux-lts when installing antergos I think that it is not possible, you will have to install it after
2014-08-22 09:45:44	patahel	sometimes that it dosnt find the root-image.sfs
2014-08-22 09:46:15	patahel	(sometimes i got it by hand with mounting sdb or so
2014-08-22 09:47:13	Noxbru	I assume that you have checked that the md5 is correct, haven't you?

2014-08-22 09:48:34	patahel	(when i mount by hand it sometimes worked, its like roulete :s
2014-08-22 09:48:56	Noxbru	that doesn't sound good at all...
2014-08-22 09:49:13	Noxbru	have you tried the same USB/CD in other computers?
2014-08-22 09:51:30	patahel	not yet, but another funny thing: instead of the antergos disk it mounts anotherone,  without a label
2014-08-22 09:52:08	patahel	(forgot that to mention
2014-08-22 09:53:14	Noxbru	strange indeed

2014-08-22 10:04:48	MichaelTunnell	patahel: once you put something on a drive with dd it will replace labels and sometimes not be mountable...it is not common but it is not rare either. I have had it work flawlessly many times and do the unmountable thing many times as well. Typicall you have to format the drive and remove any partition tables...recreate the tables and re-dd it.
2014-08-22 10:05:34	MichaelTunnell	enzro: it might be possible to use the lts in the cli vesion of the installer but it is not possible via the GUI certainly but it is fairly straight forward to switch to the lts once it is installed.
2014-08-22 10:05:42	MichaelTunnell	enzro: why do you want to use the lts?
2014-08-22 10:05:47	MichaelTunnell	just curious
2014-08-22 10:06:36	enzro	my system boots to a blank screen for all kernels above the lts
2014-08-22 10:07:19	patahel	allready did that about 3 times, but now it does that to mi harddrive
2014-08-22 10:08:01	patahel	(and allready created a new partitiontable

2014-08-23 02:47:46	Popolon	hi
2014-08-23 02:48:16	Popolon	I installed antergos for testing, everything run really fine, and the installation process is very nice
2014-08-23 02:48:25	Popolon	but I had some problems with ibus
2014-08-23 02:48:31	Popolon	I added some ibus engine
2014-08-23 02:48:44	Popolon	and they don't appear in the ibus preferences
2014-08-23 02:49:18	Popolon	also ibus doesn't start with session
2014-08-23 02:49:52	Popolon	I added the 3 export lines in .bashrc and in .xprofile
2014-08-23 02:52:11	Popolon	Another problem I noticed, there is no mean to switch from one desktop to another in lightdm
2014-08-23 02:55:46	Popolon	the preinstalled virtualbox guest parts on liveCD is a really good thing too. You made a really great work :)
2014-08-23 03:02:55	Bluemango	I think it can help if you check systemctl
2014-08-23 03:02:58	Bluemango	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemctl
2014-08-23 03:04:21	Bluemango	About the desktops, try installing another desktop and you shold see it apear in the lightdm list
2014-08-23 03:09:04	Popolon	Bluemango: ok, thanks perhaps I didn't installed the good (meta-?)package for desktop
2014-08-23 03:09:09	Popolon	I will double check
2014-08-23 03:09:51	Popolon	As far I know, ibus doesn't use systemctl, it's started by session, at least that was the case before systemd, will look this track too
2014-08-23 03:10:07	Bluemango	What desktop did you choose on installation?
2014-08-23 03:10:52	Popolon	no ibus service in systemctl
2014-08-23 03:12:17	Popolon	cinnamon desktop
2014-08-23 03:12:56	Popolon	I probably need to add a bug report for ibus, as this is really blocking for me (and probably lot of people)
2014-08-23 03:13:15	Bluemango	What is the problem you are having with ibus? That it was not installed and after you install it manually it will not start on boot?
2014-08-23 03:13:16	Popolon	the most annoying is that methods doesn't appear in the ibus setup list
2014-08-23 03:14:04	Popolon	on other distro (still didn't tried on raw arch), when you add an ibus-<method> package
2014-08-23 03:14:12	Bluemango	And along with cinnamon you have installed what other desktop?
2014-08-23 03:14:15	Popolon	this method appear in the setup
2014-08-23 03:14:24	Popolon	you then can add it as activated method
2014-08-23 03:15:00	Popolon	and dynamically switch from one to another method. Typically, your basic keyboard layout and the complex method managed by ibus
2014-08-23 03:15:31	Popolon	for the desktop : XFCE
2014-08-23 03:15:59	Popolon	using xfdesktop package
2014-08-23 03:16:14	Popolon	but I see lot of xfce4 pacakges are not installed
2014-08-23 03:16:50	Popolon	including xfce4-session :)
2014-08-23 03:17:14	Popolon	ok, installed now, I will Bluemango get a try and come back

2014-08-23 03:19:55	Popolon	doesn't work
2014-08-23 03:20:16	Bluemango	I would  use pacman -S xfce4
2014-08-23 03:20:50	Popolon	doesn't appear in pacman XG

2014-08-23 03:21:45	Bluemango	I do not use pacman XG, sorry
2014-08-23 03:22:42	Popolon	ok, I think you are right, as I'm a beginner on arch, I tried it to search packages
2014-08-23 03:22:54	Popolon	what is the command with pacman to know available packages ?
2014-08-23 03:23:01	Popolon	-Q is for installed one
2014-08-23 03:23:13	Popolon	s/know/search
2014-08-23 03:24:18	Popolon	 -s is for searching installed packages too
2014-08-23 03:24:30	Popolon	-Ss ?

2014-08-23 03:25:25	Bluemango	Try pkgfile

2014-08-23 03:27:48	Bluemango	Yes it does :)
2014-08-23 03:30:23	Popolon	I searched for mate for example, and pkgfile (after creating the db) display some packages with mate in the name (in community) but not mate itself
2014-08-23 03:31:09	Popolon	loops the same with pacman -Ss
2014-08-23 03:31:40	Popolon	is there a <meta-package> notion in arch, or something like that, that could be hidden from the package list ?
2014-08-23 03:32:42	Bluemango	One minute...
2014-08-23 03:33:28	Popolon	there are reference in packages to (mate), (mate-extra)
2014-08-23 03:34:06	Popolon	and if I type pacmn -S mate, it install mate, as for xfce4

2014-08-23 03:37:55	Popolon	that's strange that desktop chooser button and then these 2 entries didn't appear when there was only cinnamon ???
2014-08-23 03:38:11	Popolon	anyway, that works :)

2014-08-23 03:38:44	Bluemango	I have not tried Cinnamon on Antergos
2014-08-23 03:39:23	Popolon	I suppose this is a bug in cinnamon installation (from cd) that doesn't update something in lightdm
2014-08-23 03:39:41	Popolon	at least it added the two entries somewhere
2014-08-23 03:39:53	Popolon	as I didn't installed new things about cinnamon today
2014-08-23 03:40:11	Popolon	and installing xfce4+mate updated lightdm menu

2014-08-23 03:45:20	Popolon	oh, the groups :)
2014-08-23 03:45:40	Bluemango	If you need to know the members in a group, eg mate: pacman -Sg mate
2014-08-23 03:46:12	Popolon	nice :)
2014-08-23 03:46:24	Popolon	=> pacman -Sg | grep mate
2014-08-23 03:48:40	Popolon	a good method to debug lightdm problem (i will probably do this in a vm), until ibus works as I want
2014-08-23 03:48:41	Bluemango	or, if you do pacman -Sg mate, and mate is not a existing group pacman is silence :)
2014-08-23 03:48:53	Popolon	create a git repository in /etc/
2014-08-23 03:49:02	Popolon	install mate or xfce
2014-08-23 03:49:09	Popolon	look at the diff :)
2014-08-23 03:49:44	Popolon	yes, so a grep is probably better, especially for xfce that could have various number or name etc...
2014-08-23 03:50:14	Bluemango	the group list is not that long in Arch
2014-08-23 03:51:08	Bluemango	I see them all on the screen :)
2014-08-23 03:51:51	Popolon	I first think to install arch or antargos on non computer-ist computers
2014-08-23 03:52:10	Bluemango	But I recommend you also use the Arch wiki, it is great!
2014-08-23 03:52:16	Bluemango	https://wiki.archlinux.org
2014-08-23 03:52:17	Popolon	but know, I see there is a barrier for them, first pacman names packages are only in english for now
2014-08-23 03:52:52	Popolon	and this isn't the easier way to find package that could be interesting for them
2014-08-23 03:53:26	Popolon	I started to read it, since few weeks (2 or 3 month now ?) time by time :)
2014-08-23 03:53:49	Popolon	installed an archlinuxarm distro on a cubieboard2, that the starting point, where I want to switch everything to arch
2014-08-23 03:54:31	Bluemango	It have saved me many many hours of searching on the Internet since I started to use Arch
2014-08-23 03:55:30	Popolon	:)
2014-08-23 03:55:49	Popolon	I tried yaourt first time today, with failure
2014-08-23 03:55:52	Popolon	for fontmatrix package
2014-08-23 03:55:53	Bluemango	That wiki is actually one of the reasons I like Arch/Antergos
2014-08-23 03:56:08	Popolon	Yes that's very interesting to understand the system
2014-08-23 03:56:22	Popolon	sometime the french version is more uptodate
2014-08-23 03:56:36	Popolon	I looked at the step by step installation from archlinux cd
2014-08-23 03:57:32	Popolon	arch wiki is near from the Linux From Scratch point of interest to understand system
2014-08-23 03:58:27	Bluemango	That problem did you get with fontmatrix?
2014-08-23 03:59:15	Bluemango	I do not use it, but I can see that it have been updated (last update 2014-07-13 13:28)
2014-08-23 04:00:26	Bluemango	Installing fontmatrix :)
2014-08-23 04:01:14	Popolon	yaourt compile from source
2014-08-23 04:01:19	Popolon	at leat in this case
2014-08-23 04:01:44	Popolon	I thought to add some packages from archlinux to archlinuxarm, but still didn't understand the submission process
2014-08-23 04:02:26	Popolon	at least in most of case a makepkg -a on the PKGBUILD file work
2014-08-23 04:02:31	Bluemango	Yes, yaourt does build fontmatrix from source (I can see it now)
2014-08-23 04:04:10	Popolon	you will have problem at link time with libicu (the internationalization lib)
2014-08-23 04:04:48	Popolon	looks like it doesn't found a function, that is in headers (at least headers cascade)
2014-08-23 04:05:02	Popolon	could be a missing lib dependency at link time ?
2014-08-23 04:05:48	Bluemango	First package for me on arch that complies from source actually :)
2014-08-23 04:06:03	Bluemango	This feels soo Geento :D
2014-08-23 04:08:06	Bluemango	undefined reference to symbol '_ZN6icu_537UMemorynwEm'
2014-08-23 04:09:35	Bluemango	I think I will have to learn to live without fontmatrix on arch/antergos for now :)

2014-08-23 04:21:12	Bluemango	You were talking of package frontend...
2014-08-23 04:21:38	Bluemango	take a look at Octopi and see if it is something useful for your needs:

2014-08-23 04:22:46	Popolon	At least there is a display groups mode :)
2014-08-23 04:23:19	Popolon	do you know if there is translation of package description somewhere ?
2014-08-23 04:23:44	Popolon	this is requirement for lot of end user in france, as french are very bad at learning foreign languages
2014-08-23 04:24:22	Bluemango	I know :)
2014-08-23 04:25:46	Popolon	perhaps that's a problem with languages in school I don't know
2014-08-23 04:25:48	Bluemango	I know that the Arch part of dev community is discussing this with the GNOME team
2014-08-23 04:26:00	Popolon	for a translation ?
2014-08-23 04:26:11	Popolon	translation system
2014-08-23 04:26:23	Bluemango	package description and translation
2014-08-23 04:29:43	Bluemango	GNOME are developing a software called just that "Software" :)
2014-08-23 04:30:43	Bluemango	And I know there have been a lot of questions if and how that could made to work with Arch and pacman
2014-08-23 04:30:57	Bluemango	https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software
2014-08-23 04:34:18	Bluemango	And in that discussion the problem with package descriptions and translation have been brought up (but that is not one of the big problems)
2014-08-23 04:36:52	Bluemango	If you are interested in this, you can also check out Packagekit:

2014-08-23 04:46:22	satshow	Does someone know about UEFI systems?
2014-08-23 04:47:35	Bluemango	In general about UEFI start here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI
2014-08-23 04:48:13	satshow	I have now a dual boot with antergos and windows 8.1. I will delete windows 8.1 and only use antergos
2014-08-23 04:48:43	hadi	Bluemango:  thanks, just wanted to make sure. does also gnome-extra come with the live  system? i'm asking, because i want to run orca and use the ScreenReader to install my system
2014-08-23 04:51:11	Bluemango	satshow: do you really need the Windows disk space?
2014-08-23 04:52:02	satshow	no I have this computer a few months. It is a preinstalled system by asus Bluemango
2014-08-23 04:52:20	Bluemango	hadi: let me check that for you
2014-08-23 04:52:28	satshow	with windows 8
2014-08-23 04:52:49	hadi	Bluemango:  that is awesome. the package im looking for is orca, which  is in gnome3-extra group, i think
2014-08-23 04:53:21	Bluemango	satshow: why not leave it with dual boot?
2014-08-23 04:54:48	satshow	because I am read things that when I update my windows 8 that it is possible that windows make the dual boot undone
2014-08-23 04:56:11	Bluemango	sat: oh, I do not know anything about that
2014-08-23 04:57:44	satshow	yes it is not easy
2014-08-23 04:57:47	Bluemango	sat: but it sounds very agressive, and even against the law for Microsoft to do something like that
2014-08-23 04:58:08	satshow	yes I know

2014-08-23 05:11:11	Popolon	Bluemango: thanks a lot
2014-08-23 05:11:15	Popolon	I will look at this
2014-08-23 05:14:35	Popolon	I really like the ability from orca to be able to zoom/unzoom the desktop with alt+mouse wheel
2014-08-23 05:15:15	Popolon	that's a killer feature even for non visual impaired people.

2014-08-23 05:17:50	hadi	I use orca as a ScreenReader since i'm totally blind
2014-08-23 05:17:58	Popolon	but this zoom the whole desktop view
2014-08-23 05:18:03	Popolon	that could be used for :
2014-08-23 05:18:18	Popolon	* see how antialiasing is rendered (and eventually debugging)
2014-08-23 05:18:34	Popolon	* look more precisally at drawing for artists
2014-08-23 05:18:50	Popolon	* make a non fullscreen-able application use the whole screen
2014-08-23 05:18:59	Popolon	ans probably more things
2014-08-23 05:20:34	Popolon	I just see it doesn't work by default on mate, but I perhaps not activated it on antergos or something  like that

2014-08-23 10:18:30	ParkerR	Does antergos have the b43 legacy firmware out of the box? Ive been beating my head trying to get it installed on a machine without a wired connection (plain Arch)
2014-08-23 10:19:41	MichaelTunnell	checking
2014-08-23 10:20:40	ParkerR	I tried building the package on another machine but after installing and modprobing b43legacy it kernel panics
2014-08-23 10:21:42	MichaelTunnell	it is not included because it is no longer included in Arch...it is not only in the AUR so Antergos does not include it but here is a thread that explains how to use it in your install. https://github.com/Antergos/antergos-iso/issues/16
2014-08-23 10:21:59	MichaelTunnell	it is now only*

2014-08-23 10:23:16	ParkerR	Well this is an old machine I dont a lot about. I may try the debian non-free bundle to see if it works

2014-08-23 10:47:25	ParkerR	For the debian install it was usb0:
2014-08-23 10:48:16	MichaelTunnell	yea makes sense
2014-08-23 10:48:35	MichaelTunnell	it detects as usb but it uses it as a wired connection

2014-08-23 10:48:54	MichaelTunnell	just detects it differently so it doesnt interfere with eth0+

2014-08-25 12:29:51	NotFig	Hello. I am relatively new to Gnome, seeing as this is my first time using it. Could anyone tell me how I can change the trackpad to be able to use the right side (ONE FINGER) for scrolling, instead of two fingers in the middle, as well as be able to tap it once, with a single finger to register as a "click"? Lastly, the settings menu seems... small, how can I get around really changing themes, and functionality?
2014-08-25 12:31:05	NotFig	Such as: Changing the tab switching display (Installing other ones, as the default ones are meh)

2014-08-26 10:44:53	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: weird right
2014-08-26 10:49:43	haruspex	perhaps some are bots . with a built-in echo funktion..
2014-08-26 10:49:47	haruspex	:P
2014-08-26 10:50:11	sinix	I'm a bot
2014-08-26 10:50:13	Noxbru	maybe :)
2014-08-26 10:50:15	lasers	I'm a bot
2014-08-26 10:50:15	MichaelTunnell	haruspex: nope we are all users :) the part that is weird is usually no one responds for 15 minutes at least lol
2014-08-26 10:50:16	Noxbru	I was a bot
2014-08-26 10:51:01	haruspex	ah i see :)
2014-08-26 10:51:42	MichaelTunnell	I'm not a bot ::does Nixon's "I'm not a crook" pose::

2014-08-26 10:52:41	 *	sinix poses like a bot
2014-08-26 10:52:41	Noxbru	or something like that
2014-08-26 10:55:16	haruspex	im new to antegros linux
2014-08-26 10:55:56	haruspex	a n00b question :  can one compile a kernel under antegros?
2014-08-26 10:56:09	Noxbru	haruspex: sure thing :)
2014-08-26 10:56:14	MichaelTunnell	haruspex: sure if you want to...you can compile anything in any distro if you want to
2014-08-26 10:56:18	Noxbru	abs makes it very easy
2014-08-26 10:56:20	sinix	I'm pretty sure any question that contains "compile kernel" isn't a noob question
2014-08-26 10:56:20	haruspex	or are the kernels only updatet by the installer .. ??
2014-08-26 10:56:59	MichaelTunnell	sinix: lol yes
2014-08-26 10:58:20	MichaelTunnell	haruspex: you can compile anything or just install anything without compiling...(unless it is in the AUR, those are compiled)
2014-08-26 10:58:40	MichaelTunnell	haruspex: are you familiar with Arch Linux?
2014-08-26 10:58:43	Noxbru	building a kernel, the ABS way https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Compilation/Arch_Build_System

2014-08-27 08:53:37	MichaelP	besides antergos being easier to install then arch... is there any key differences ?
2014-08-27 09:01:19	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: not really and that is the point of Antergos actually
2014-08-27 09:01:39	MichaelTunnell	it is meant to just be an easier access point to Arch but still be completely compatible with all things Arch
2014-08-27 09:02:19	MichaelTunnell	Antergos does have extra polish with icons and themes....and it does give you default applications installed where Arch does not but everything else is pretty much pure Arch
2014-08-27 09:02:40	MichaelTunnell	though you could install the Base version of Antergos and not get any default applications if you prefer that setup.
2014-08-27 09:04:09	MichaelTunnell	if you have any further questions please mention my name here (in full) so I will be notified that there is something to respond to. :) back to idle now
2014-08-27 09:06:10	MichaelP	MichaelTunnell: so there is none of the crap like manjaro has...
2014-08-27 09:06:48	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: exactly, none of that...no kernel changes, no BS ofholding back packages for fake stability, none of that
2014-08-27 09:06:59	MichaelP	orfor kde is plasma 5 ready yet
2014-08-27 09:07:45	MichaelTunnell	that is a question for KDE people yet but they released the first version so depends I suppose but if Arch access to Plasma 5 then so does Antergos
2014-08-27 09:08:11	ShaunaGordon	Plasma 5 is in the AUR
2014-08-27 09:08:18	MichaelTunnell	Arch Official Repos and the AUR are used for Antergos...no useless repo forking in Antergos
2014-08-27 09:09:09	MichaelTunnell	ShaunaGordon: ahh ok thanks so MichaelP if it is in the AUR then Antergos has access to it via the AUR
2014-08-27 09:09:39	MichaelP	yeah some packages in AUR for plasma not want to build... Spend an hour... then get a package that say error building do you want to restart
2014-08-27 09:11:17	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: you will need to make a comment on that PKGBUILD in the AUR
2014-08-27 09:12:04	MichaelTunnell	if the PKGBUILD maintainer might not be aware of the problem...always best to comment there and make sure they know it exists so it can be addressed
2014-08-27 09:12:07	MichaelP	What desktop you give more attention to... i noticed in distro watch... gnome is default right
2014-08-27 09:12:22	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: there is no default in Antergos
2014-08-27 09:12:40	MichaelTunnell	that is the point of Antergos and Arch...you can use whatever you want.
2014-08-27 09:13:51	MichaelTunnell	btw, I dont think anyone in here is a project member. Just so you know our answers are not "official" responses
2014-08-27 09:14:08	MichaelP	I did not know if you have one desktop you focos more attention to or what
2014-08-27 09:14:42	MichaelTunnell	Antergos team focuses on all of the desktops that are supported in Cnchi...equal attention is given to all of them
2014-08-27 09:15:31	MichaelTunnell	people automatically assume that because the LiveUSB ISO is setup to use GNOME in the installer then automatically that is the "default DE" but that is just an invalid assumption.

2014-08-27 09:16:10	MichaelP	does distro use arch repo's or have it's own
2014-08-27 09:17:08	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: as I've already stated, Antergos uses Arch everything except for the "polish stuff" which refers to icons, themes, fonts, etc...all the stuff to make everything look nice is Antergos but Repo & AUR is all Arch
2014-08-27 09:18:36	MichaelP	i 1st used it when it was cinnarch
2014-08-27 09:19:40	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: alright. CinnArch was a different goal...Antergos is completely reinvisioned and has a completely different goal than CinnArch so everything you knew about that one, you can just forget it all. :)
2014-08-27 09:20:03	MichaelTunnell	except that it is the same team
2014-08-27 09:22:17	MichaelP	what about like in archbang is 100% arch repo... but always have to pacman-key --init && pacman-key --populate archlinux.... is that a problem in Antergos
2014-08-27 09:26:07	MichaelTunnell	no MichaelP pacman works the exact same in Antergos as it does in Arch
2014-08-27 09:26:09	MichaelTunnell	no extra crap
2014-08-27 09:29:07	MichaelP	ok.. burn iso to disk and check it out

2014-08-27 11:29:23	installhelpme	yeah, the problem is the antergos live seems unable to let me connect through my usb modem, the modem is not as fault as i've been using for kali live too
2014-08-27 11:36:14	MichaelTunnell	you may need to install a driver for that I am not sure about that
2014-08-27 11:36:33	MichaelTunnell	using my phone via usb modem works fine for me with Antergos

2014-08-29 07:48:32	FelixCatus	Hello
2014-08-29 07:48:46	Noxbru	hi, FelixCatus
2014-08-29 07:50:52	FelixCatus	I've had some strange bug in my logs so i want to test it out on different kernels
2014-08-29 07:51:04	FelixCatus	So i installed linux-lts and linux-ck
2014-08-29 07:52:12	FelixCatus	but i found that grub doesn't add any initrd for other kernels in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2014-08-29 07:52:49	Noxbru	that's what I have heard, yes
2014-08-29 07:53:04	Noxbru	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2028 maybe this can help
2014-08-29 07:55:01	FelixCatus	here are output of grub-mkconfig and grub.cfg file
2014-08-29 07:55:05	FelixCatus	http://lpaste.net/2020088505614467072
2014-08-29 07:55:09	FelixCatus	http://lpaste.net/3473497308207775744
2014-08-29 07:55:55	FelixCatus	Definitly it helps
2014-08-29 07:56:01	FelixCatus	than you Noxbru
2014-08-29 07:56:08	FelixCatus	thank*
2014-08-29 07:56:10	Noxbru	you are welcome FelixCatus :)
2014-08-29 07:58:24	FelixCatus	so it seems to be problem with Antegros rather than grub itself?
2014-08-29 08:00:41	Noxbru	so it seems, yes
2014-08-29 08:00:57	FelixCatus	All the time i was thinking it is upstream grub problem.
2014-08-29 08:01:32	FelixCatus	Thats the reason i culdn't find anyting helpful
2014-08-29 08:02:19	Noxbru	I'm sorry to hear that. at least, it is a known problem already reported
2014-08-29 08:02:26	Noxbru	hopefully, it will get corrected
2014-08-29 08:03:24	FelixCatus	Antergos!=Arch as i was thinking
2014-08-29 08:04:02	Noxbru	I use to think that they are the same
2014-08-29 08:18:14	FelixCatus	Do someone here have ssd? There is ata1.00: failed to get NCQ Send/Recv Log Emask 0x1 bug that i found in my logs. From what i've read the bug is present and untoched in kernels from 3.12 to current. I think that Samsung SSDs are only affected, but I'm not sure about it.
2014-08-29 08:18:39	Noxbru	not me, sorry...

2014-08-30 14:13:52	_nim	I chose XFCE during the installation process, so it came preinstalled with Antergos stuff. The KDE version which I used before worked fine, by the way

2014-08-30 14:46:41	MichaelTunnell	some times the wrong device will be selected sometimes applications will be muted randomly
2014-08-30 14:46:46	MichaelTunnell	xfce is really a mess
2014-08-30 14:48:11	MichaelTunnell	I dont mean the XFCE version of Antergos...I mean XFCE entirely...it is a mess
2014-08-30 14:48:40	_nim	Sorry, but what settings in particular are you referring to? I can change output device if that's what you mean but it doesn't change anything. I'd be willing to change DE (and reinstall if needed) if it could fix it, as long as it has great multi monitor support and isn't KDE 4.X
2014-08-30 14:50:56	MichaelTunnell	I'm not an XFCE user and havent been for years so I can't fix xfce specific stuff but pavucontrol should help solve it...you will need to just play around with the settings and try various things in it
2014-08-30 14:51:28	MichaelTunnell	as far as another DE I am not sure what your opinion of great multi monitor support would intail so it is not something I can suggest
2014-08-30 14:52:07	MichaelTunnell	I use GNOME but I also only use one monitor most of the time even though I have tested multiple monitors with it and it works great for me but it all matters what kind of setup the user wants
2014-08-30 14:53:42	_nim	I just want a seperate taskbar/or something else for each monitor so I can seperate what tasks/programs run on which display. I'd love to use Cinnamon but it only allows panels on the primary displays and it's quite buggy.

2014-08-30 18:05:50	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: interesting...check your sound settings it might just be muted, that has happened to me before
2014-08-30 18:06:04	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: It isn't identified in the sound settings.
2014-08-30 18:06:05	MichaelTunnell	also try installing pavucontrol for more control over the settings
2014-08-30 18:06:16	MichaelTunnell	sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
2014-08-30 18:07:14	MichaelTunnell	gtg for 20 minutes but try that and let me know...I'll see when I get back
2014-08-30 18:07:29	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: only device shown in the output for pavu is the hdmi out not my onboard sound
2014-08-30 18:07:42	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: Ok i guess i'll be around if i can't figure it out
2014-08-30 18:11:38	norgi	michaeltunnell: i use cinnamon, i guess by bypassing the loginscreen there is no password protection?
2014-08-30 18:12:15	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: that is very weird, check to see if you have pulseaudio installed
2014-08-30 18:12:39	MichaelTunnell	and pulseaudio-alsa

2014-08-30 18:13:45	MichaelTunnell	norgi: correct it you would remove that but for me I have no need for that...if you do then you should look into replacing lightdm with gdm or something else. The Arch Wiki should have a page on doing something like this
2014-08-30 18:14:01	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: both show up.  pulseaudio-alsa 2-3 & pulseaudio 5.0-1

2014-08-30 18:16:16	MichaelTunnell	norgi: the whole point of Antergos and Arch is to use whatever you want or need...that is why it has access to basically everything. If you are approaching it similar to how one would approach Ubuntu then I think you might not enjoy the experience
2014-08-30 18:16:43	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: weird which version of Antergos do you install with? the latest August build?
2014-08-30 18:17:00	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: downloaded the iso from the website this morning
2014-08-30 18:20:04	norgi	i have to admit a huge part of me using arch is the aur. Anyway i prefer to choose a good fitting defautl installation for me and than do the rest through little tweaks
2014-08-30 18:20:54	norgi	mostly cause i dont have time to build a system from the ground up anymore, hence the use of antergos

2014-08-30 21:42:19	MichaelTunnell	other than the fact that the kernel in the liveusb is not going to be the kernel installed
2014-08-30 21:42:43	MichaelTunnell	you may have sound issues with the current kernel
2014-08-30 21:43:14	MichaelTunnell	load up the liveusb and do the pacman -Q thing and search for the kernel to see which version it is

2014-08-30 21:43:28	MichaelTunnell	there might be a problem with your kernel version with your hardware
2014-08-30 21:43:43	MichaelTunnell	when the kernel updates it can certainly cause issues
2014-08-30 21:43:49	MichaelTunnell	has for many a couple times
2014-08-30 21:44:06	defun	I am having hard time installing on a raid 0 created by mdadm does any one tried to install on raid0 any help will be greatly appreciated
2014-08-30 21:44:21	vecchp	MichaelTunnell:  Possibly.  I just find it odd that the first time i switched from linux to linux-lts sound came back. Then after that I was doing some fixes for Steam for pulse audio and then after a reboot it died.  Then going from linux-lts back to linux brought sound back.
2014-08-30 21:45:15	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I've never seen something like that even when I used gentoo for a couple years.
2014-08-30 21:45:19	MichaelTunnell	defun: why are you using raid0 for your OS?
2014-08-30 21:45:59	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: you are adding stuff then since you are applying steam stuff so certainly there is something being done because of the changes you are making
2014-08-30 21:46:00	defun	MichaleTunnell: I've sony vaio z with raid disk so wanted to use all 2 disks and mount it under / and /home
2014-08-30 21:47:20	MichaelTunnell	defun: there is never a need to raid a single disk
2014-08-30 21:47:26	MichaelTunnell	you can just partition it
2014-08-30 21:47:39	defun	MichaleTunnell: these are 2 disks 256GB each
2014-08-30 21:47:57	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: I've never seen a kernel swap from lts to current make such a different either especially when the reverse did the same...that is weird
2014-08-30 21:48:21	MichaelTunnell	you dont need a raid for that
2014-08-30 21:48:28	MichaelTunnell	raid is redundancy aka backing up
2014-08-30 21:48:37	MichaelTunnell	you seem to want one disk for / and one for /home
2014-08-30 21:48:52	MichaelTunnell	just set the mount points as such and that is all that is needed
2014-08-30 21:49:06	vecchp	MichaelTunnell:  Well I didn't mean to say I wasn't adding anything.  But I was under the impression it was all just software instead of things that would need a recompile of the kernel.  Like for example i understand that when you download say nvidia drivers the nvidia modules needed to be recompiled for the kernel.  But i didn't see anything like that for what I was doing with steam.  Maybe there was.  But what I also found
2014-08-30 21:49:06	MichaelTunnell	if you want the redundancy then alright but it is not needed
2014-08-30 21:49:10	vecchp	even weirder was that if I reinstalled the current kernel say linux-lts over itself the sound didn't come back.  Maybe I just missed something or don't fully understand Arch yet.  I've only been using it for about 2 days so far.
2014-08-30 21:49:43	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: do you have the multilibs activated?
2014-08-30 21:49:49	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: Yes
2014-08-30 21:50:03	MichaelTunnell	and modules are not recompiling anything their point is to avoid that
2014-08-30 21:50:31	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: the kernel swap doesnt make sense to solve it
2014-08-30 21:50:39	MichaelTunnell	lts to current solving it makes sense

2014-08-30 21:50:50	MichaelTunnell	but the reverse and then do go back again...that makes no sense
2014-08-30 21:51:08	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I fully agree.  If it comes back i'll see if I can isolate what exactly was the problem.
2014-08-30 21:51:42	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: sounds good...at least it is working now though :)
2014-08-30 21:52:19	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: In any case I'm really liking the polished gnome3 interface
2014-08-30 21:52:43	MichaelTunnell	I do as well. I use GNOME3
2014-08-30 21:53:05	MichaelTunnell	I have customized it a lot but still that is a plus to the quality of how easy it is to improve
2014-08-30 21:54:03	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: yah i haven't used gnome in for a while.  I used Unity once it came out for ubuntu and then basically went back to Windows for a bit.  Now seeing this gnome3 interface i'm pretty impressed.
2014-08-30 21:55:10	MichaelTunnell	Unity was crap in 11.04-11.10 then good for 12.04 -12.10 back to crap for 13.04-13.10 and good again at 14.04
2014-08-30 21:55:20	MichaelTunnell	though I still absolutely hate the Dash
2014-08-30 21:56:10	MichaelTunnell	GNOME3 was crap up until 3.6 then it became fairly decent then 3.8 was really good...3.10 was great and now 13.12 is fantastic to me
2014-08-30 21:56:19	MichaelTunnell	I also tried Cinnamon 1.6-2.2
2014-08-30 21:56:28	MichaelTunnell	I try lots of DEs :)
2014-08-30 21:56:34	vecchp	lol
2014-08-30 21:56:45	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: do you use anything that notifies you of arch/pacman updates? I saw something called octopi-notifier, but couldn't seem to get it to run.
2014-08-30 21:57:28	MichaelTunnell	but I test them purely to know what I am talking about when I refer to them but I prefer GNOME now. I used to prefer Cinnamon because my old computer couldn't handle GNOME completely so now my new one is great so it is super solid with GNOME
2014-08-30 21:58:00	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: octopi-notifier depends on octopi which is a GUI for arch...kind of like Synaptic
2014-08-30 21:58:23	MichaelTunnell	I think PacmanXG is the best GUI for Arch but it does not have a notifier that I know of
2014-08-30 21:58:46	vecchp	in most of my linux experience I've liked gnome.  Though I went through a period really liking XFCE4
2014-08-30 21:59:01	MichaelTunnell	I think that a notifier in Arch is rather silly though...I had a debate on a Mumble server about it like a week ago.
2014-08-30 21:59:18	MichaelTunnell	it boils down to one thing that makes me think it is silly...
2014-08-30 21:59:24	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I guess the argument is that you should be reading the news anyway?
2014-08-30 21:59:43	MichaelTunnell	Arch updates at least once every 3 days so why not just check around that time....almost always something
2014-08-30 22:00:05	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: no the News is not relevant to regular updates...only massive potential breakage updates
2014-08-30 22:00:24	vecchp	oh
2014-08-30 22:00:46	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: I actually don't mind most DEs...I don't like KDE but I don't hate it...I recognize it has so cool options.
2014-08-30 22:00:59	MichaelTunnell	XFeCEs on the other hand...I hate
2014-08-30 22:01:40	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: KDE always used to look messy to me.  Like where a kid took a toybox and then mixed every possible color in random.  But actually the antergos kde looks kind of nice.
2014-08-30 22:01:44	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: Arch News updates about once a month or so...but there are always package updates A LOT faster than that
2014-08-30 22:02:21	MichaelTunnell	I dont like KDE because it is hideous but functionaly it has some awesome features. XFCE is just xfeces through out
2014-08-30 22:03:59	MichaelTunnell	I actually plan on making a blog post about why I hate XFCE lol and yes I do expect hate comments from it
2014-08-30 22:04:15	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: you have a blog?

2014-08-30 22:05:14	MichaelTunnell	I mostly talk about Linux stuff but not exclusively
2014-08-30 22:05:14	vecchp	ahh nice
2014-08-30 22:06:18	MichaelTunnell	http://michaeltunnell.com/about lists my open source contributions and such also a lot of the stuff needs to be updated still
2014-08-30 22:07:26	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: is there any simple way to install old packages?  Like say if I wanted to use CUDA5.5 instead of the latest 6.5?  I know in gentoo you used to be able to just like specify the package version.  So far in arch it seems like it just kind of rolls to the next version and that is it.. unless you have like a cache of the previous version.
2014-08-30 22:08:10	MichaelTunnell	yea basically cache is the only way it is done in Arch although you can build a PKGBUILD to install something like that
2014-08-30 22:08:30	MichaelTunnell	then you need to go into pacman.conf to tell pacman to ignore updates
2014-08-30 22:08:53	MichaelTunnell	there might be an old package in the ABS but not sure
2014-08-30 22:09:15	vecchp	ok
2014-08-30 22:09:21	vecchp	i'll take a look at that later then

2014-08-30 22:12:15	MichaelTunnell	just create a pkgbuild with that and it should work though I havent tested it so dont know
2014-08-30 22:13:05	vecchp	oh coll.  it looks pretty simple too
2014-08-30 22:13:08	vecchp	*cool
2014-08-30 22:14:22	MichaelTunnell	well you essentially just need to make the pkgbuild file and you may need a .install file but thats it
2014-08-30 22:14:27	MichaelTunnell	most likely
2014-08-30 22:14:48	MichaelTunnell	here is the Arch Wiki page for them https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgbuild

2014-09-01 09:49:32	zell1	hey guys
2014-09-01 09:50:50	zell1	I'm about to do a fresh install of Antergos onto a machine which is running AMD cards. I know Xorg 1.16 is having issues with catalyst. Besides pointing to xorg 1.15, is there anything else I should do to ensure it runs without a hitch?
2014-09-01 09:52:38	sinix	should be fine like that - tho you can do the 116->115 downgrade after install

2014-09-01 09:53:05	sinix	in my case, the 116 just meant my video card fans were running full blast 24/7
2014-09-01 09:53:34	zell1	Really? Ah I thought it was a worse issue. The fans wont be a problem because the system is under water.
2014-09-01 09:54:09	zell1	I just want to ensure the system recognizes the cards so that it can run programs like Steam without opengl errors
2014-09-01 09:55:04	sinix	yeah, it recognized everything just fine
2014-09-01 09:55:36	zell1	Cool. Thanks for the heads up. I appreciate the help.

So I had to manually tell the module which card was the primary one by putting "options snd_hda_intel index=1" in a conf fire in modprobe.d.

2014-09-02 01:11:54	qdata	vecchp:  watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo      <- will give you an idea what your cpu might be up to
2014-09-02 01:12:59	qdata	and if you have cpupower installed: cpupower frequency-info -p  will tell you which governor you may be using
2014-09-02 01:13:44	qdata	the powersaving governor has a tendency to run the processor at 1.6GHz
2014-09-02 01:13:53	vecchp	oh... well look at that its throttling it
2014-09-02 01:14:11	vecchp	i'm currently at 800mhz.  but i'm sure it adjusts due to load
2014-09-02 01:14:44	Noxbru	powersave governor always puts the CPU in its lowest frequency
2014-09-02 01:14:51	qdata	yup
2014-09-02 01:15:50	qdata	change the governor to performance and your box won't be as sluggish
2014-09-02 01:16:43	vecchp	hmm
2014-09-02 01:16:47	vecchp	i'll try
2014-09-02 01:18:18	qdata	still looking into the intel_pstate driver wrt to the kernel version antergos is using, but it was known to be quite buggy and not sure how well it may have improved
2014-09-02 01:18:49	vecchp	brb gonna reboot

2014-09-02 01:18:57	qdata	I've only used Antergos for one day know
2014-09-02 01:19:57	qdata	aside form all the little quirks one runs across setting up a new OS performance seems quite good

2014-09-02 01:25:57	vecchp	is there a thing i have to setup to get the network manager to work properly in gnome
2014-09-02 01:26:12	vecchp	it just constantly says conecting....
2014-09-02 01:26:15	vecchp	but never changes
2014-09-02 01:26:29	vecchp	and if I start and stop the connection i lose it all together
2014-09-02 01:26:58	qdata	the 800MHz isn't throttling it's an idle state
2014-09-02 01:27:21	qdata	yeah - got the same kind of situation with networm manager here
2014-09-02 01:28:14	qdata	it has 2 copies of the same connection and the default one it tries to use just sits there doing the 'connecting' forever thing
2014-09-02 01:28:55	Noxbru	maybe you can remove one of them? or both and readd it?
2014-09-02 01:29:05	qdata	if I do a disconnect then connect it works, but only 'til I reboot then have to do it again
2014-09-02 01:29:23	qdata	nope - tried removing it and it comes back
2014-09-02 01:30:20	qdata	definitely something broke in network management land but I don't reboot very often so for now I'll try and live with it
2014-09-02 01:32:25	qdata	haven't looked yet at what version systemd is and thinking if it is the bewer one that has the netctl bits I bet it's a bad ineration with that and the desktop network management apps
2014-09-02 01:33:08	 *	qdata brand new to Antergos - up 1 day now
2014-09-02 01:37:26	Noxbru	ok, back from doing stupid makepkgs

2014-09-02 01:48:15	vecchp	hmm
2014-09-02 01:48:32	vecchp	as much as i like antergos i'm not sure if i like how things just seem to break randomly
2014-09-02 01:48:46	Noxbru	vecchp: break? like what?
2014-09-02 01:49:16	vecchp	i used to get about 27000 fps in glxgears.  now its about half and i think the rendering isn't working right
2014-09-02 01:50:01	Noxbru	aha... what card?
2014-09-02 01:50:07	vecchp	my nvidia drivers are current and were recompiled so it shouldn't be a module issue.  I vsync is off so there shouldn't be any particular cap either
2014-09-02 01:50:09	vecchp	gtx 770
2014-09-02 01:50:20	vecchp	it think its basically a rebranded 680
2014-09-02 01:50:31	Noxbru	I know nothing about nvidia, sorry...
2014-09-02 01:51:12	vecchp	and then there are just little particulars that just don't seem to work quite right.  like the network manager just constantly saying connecting.
2014-09-02 01:51:36	vecchp	i love the idea of rolling release but i guess i kind of just don't want to worry about my every day pc having issues like.
2014-09-02 01:51:56	Noxbru	never had that problem...
2014-09-02 01:52:11	Aethysius	vecchp: I'm the same way.
2014-09-02 01:52:34	Aethysius	I just don't know which distro I'd go to next.
2014-09-02 01:52:51	Noxbru	for me, Antergos/Arch is very stable... somethings break, but nothing big or that I can't fix
2014-09-02 01:53:18	vecchp	the only disto i used for a very long time that was rolling release was gentoo
2014-09-02 01:53:25	vecchp	i really liked it and it seemed stable at the time
2014-09-02 01:53:37	vecchp	so i'm not sure if its me setting something up wrong
2014-09-02 01:53:41	vecchp	a software instability
2014-09-02 01:53:46	Noxbru	too many compilations for me...
2014-09-02 01:53:47	vecchp	or a hardware instability
2014-09-02 01:54:52	Aethysius	I don't really feel like fucking with everything needed to get my AMD Radeon drivers working.
2014-09-02 01:55:22	Noxbru	I build almost all the graphics stack myself for my AMD card, and it's fine
2014-09-02 01:56:04	Noxbru	its a PIA when I have to change llvm but everything works
2014-09-02 01:56:20	Aethysius	It seems that xorg 1.16 doesn't like the drivers.
2014-09-02 01:57:19	vecchp	I'm tempted to either go back to gentoo after like 5 years of not using it.  Or go to ubuntu and live with whatever they give me
2014-09-02 01:57:39	Noxbru	I use xorg 1.16
2014-09-02 01:58:21	qdata	I've used Kubuntu for the last 3 years but I SO really want to get away from that
2014-09-02 01:58:46	Noxbru	how about Fedora? I used it for two years before coming to Antergos
2014-09-02 01:59:12	qdata	lots of stuff 'Just Works' but they patch things and either won't send patches upstream or upstream doesn't accept them
2014-09-02 01:59:59	qdata	didn't fully realize the Canonical private patch situation for a long time until I began looking around at other things
2014-09-02 02:01:21	qdata	I used openSUSE for a few years before winding up with Kubuntu. the Attachmate/Novell thing kind of affected them in a not so great way
2014-09-02 02:01:51	qdata	before switching to Linux as a desktop I used KDE on FreeBSD for the longest time
2014-09-02 02:02:20	vecchp	i've used fedora before
2014-09-02 02:02:34	vecchp	nothing really special in my opinion
2014-09-02 02:02:39	qdata	but the FreeBSD/KDE desktop was taking too much of time making it go and I need a box that I can use for $real_life productive work
2014-09-02 02:06:36	vecchp	maybe i'll try sabayon

2014-09-02 11:29:27	madcyclist	Have spent most of the afternoon trying different suggestions found online to no avail, just reinstalled Antergos and now re-installing pcbsd to try again
2014-09-02 11:30:48	madcyclist	some parts of the wiki went over my head, managed to get pcbsd added to grub list, but can't get past not a 'ufs' system, haven't found a way to make it recognise xfs

2014-09-02 11:32:20	ShaunaGordon	The Grub setup that Antegros ships with should be able to pick up other operating systems automatically, by running grub-probe
2014-09-02 11:32:57	ShaunaGordon	The ufs system sounds more like a configuration error in your pcbsd setup

2014-09-03 21:14:49	vecchp	hmmm
2014-09-03 21:14:56	vecchp	i must suck at using arch
2014-09-03 21:15:16	MichaelTunnell_	?
2014-09-03 21:15:17	vecchp	since going to gentoo made all the issues i was having go away
2014-09-03 21:15:53	vecchp	MichaelTunnell_: In antergos/arch like every other reboot my GPU performance would be different
2014-09-03 21:16:23	vecchp	i guess maybe it didn't block a kernel that wasn't compatible with the nVidia drivers or something
2014-09-03 21:16:45	vecchp	like one startup i'd get like 27000 in glxgears another i'd get 10000
2014-09-03 21:17:34	vecchp	in gentoo i'm getting 20000ish constant
2014-09-03 21:17:53	MichaelTunnell_	that is freaking weird
2014-09-03 21:18:03	vecchp	yah
2014-09-03 21:18:43	vecchp	I'll see how long this lasts though. I kind of liked antergos but for some reason every time I use linux I always end up going back to gentoo
2014-09-03 21:21:15	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: I like gentoo
2014-09-03 21:21:51	vecchp	MichaelTunnell_: I dislike the compile time, but one it gets running it seems to work pretty well
2014-09-03 21:22:35	vecchp	it's also probably the only distro I every manually configure a kernel on
2014-09-03 21:22:57	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: yea I love the fact that Gentoo started doing bins for like Firefox
2014-09-03 21:22:59	MichaelTunnell_	so nice
2014-09-03 21:23:10	MichaelTunnell_	but they are kind of slow for updates compared to Arch which is why I use Arch
2014-09-03 21:23:34	vecchp	well the updates are only slow on the "stable" branch from what i've seen
2014-09-03 21:23:50	vecchp	if you do something like ~amd64 you can get pretty much everything the minute it comes out
2014-09-03 21:23:57	vecchp	but then your run into problems usually
2014-09-03 21:24:07	vecchp	i guess similar to what i was having on arch
2014-09-03 21:25:07	vecchp	i used gentoo a lot about 5 years ago.  One thing i find really different now is the whole adoption of systemd
2014-09-03 21:25:25	vecchp	i guess i missed this whole controversy
2014-09-03 21:41:48	qdata	wow - clementine crash spewed forth one of the grandest backtraces I've seem in quite a while   :-)

I guess I'll just stick with Antergos now since I don't really want to redo an installation again.  I've been flipping between distros like every other day for a week heh.

2014-09-05 11:01:11	abckb__	hi after installing antergos, I can't boot my other OS -- no menu entry of that OS. How can I fix it?
2014-09-05 11:07:36	ShaunaGordon	EFI or legacy BIOS?
2014-09-05 11:09:02	abckb__	legacy BIOS
2014-09-05 11:09:42	Noxbru	abckb__: have you tried regenerating the grub menu?
2014-09-05 11:10:03	Noxbru	abckb__: look for 'grub-mkconfig'
2014-09-05 11:10:35	abckb__	Noxbru: Yeah I ran it
2014-09-05 11:10:57	abckb__	grub-mkcinfig -o /boot/grub/grub/cfg
2014-09-05 11:11:01	abckb__	thats it?
2014-09-05 11:11:09	Noxbru	meh... maybe it's not detecting your other OSes
2014-09-05 11:11:32	abckb__	Noxbru: I think it has detected
2014-09-05 11:11:33	Noxbru	grub-mkcinfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2014-09-05 11:12:01	abckb__	yeah that extra grub I wrote is a typo
2014-09-05 11:12:18	Noxbru	there's no extra grub
2014-09-05 11:12:32	Noxbru	/boot/grub/ is the directory, grub.cfg is the file
2014-09-05 11:13:49	abckb__	ok
2014-09-05 11:14:02	abckb__	Now, to test it I have to reboot
2014-09-05 11:14:25	Noxbru	you can also save it elsewhere and diff with the one you already have

2014-09-05 11:29:47	abckb__	okay now I can boot into my other OS. But having another issue with antergos!
2014-09-05 11:30:01	Noxbru	abckb__: which one?
2014-09-05 11:31:19	abckb__	At GNOME3 login, it says "Uh oh authentication error...." But I'm giving the right password. I think it has something to do with different keyboard layout at login. Its en-GB at login.
2014-09-05 11:31:42	Noxbru	that's strange...
2014-09-05 11:31:49	Noxbru	what's your layout?
2014-09-05 11:31:50	abckb__	But I remember setting en-US
2014-09-05 11:32:18	Noxbru	en-US and en-GB aren't that different, I think
2014-09-05 11:32:37	abckb__	But whats the cause then.
2014-09-05 11:33:33	Noxbru	honestly, I don't know
2014-09-05 11:33:38	abckb__	Its really strange!
2014-09-05 11:33:48	Noxbru	I have checked here and I don't have an input source set for the login screen
2014-09-05 11:34:09	abckb__	okay
2014-09-05 11:35:16	Noxbru	still, I think that on the top left corner there's some menu for choosing the layout
2014-09-05 11:35:28	abckb__	at login?
2014-09-05 11:35:40	Noxbru	if I remember correctly yes
2014-09-05 11:35:47	Noxbru	at least, there's some options there
2014-09-05 11:35:55	abckb__	Ok let me check. I didn't notice that

2014-09-05 11:47:34	Noxbru	lightdm or gdm?

2014-09-05 11:47:50	abckb__	GNOME3's default I think

2014-09-05 11:48:23	Noxbru	have you tried to login in a tty?
2014-09-05 11:49:46	abckb__	how to do that?
2014-09-05 11:50:26	Noxbru	ctrl+alt+F2, you will be in a 'pure' terminal which will ask for your username and password
2014-09-05 11:50:36	abckb__	okay
2014-09-05 11:50:41	abckb__	gonna do that now
2014-09-05 11:50:44	Noxbru	you can try there, and even you can try writing your password there to see if it is what it should be
2014-09-05 11:51:10	abckb__	after logging in that way can get GUI?
2014-09-05 11:51:24	Noxbru	not sure...

2014-09-05 20:25:24	sinix	he didn't wait very long
2014-09-05 20:26:33	sinix	re: empathy: it's a little out of scope for this little channel - are you using gnome?
2014-09-05 20:27:20	sinix	i haven't got a useful answer, but I've been noticing some characters being replaced with.. "noncharacters" recently
2014-09-05 20:27:30	sinix	like, an asterisk, or something
2014-09-05 20:28:09	sinix	that's on my other computer tho
2014-09-05 20:29:40	vecchp	sinix: well the only reason i asked was because i've only noticed this issue when using antergos.  I had a gentoo install and never seemed to have a problem
2014-09-05 20:29:51	vecchp	sinix: but yah i'm using gnom
2014-09-05 20:31:49	MichaelTunnell	Empathy = Meh... Pidgin = FTW
2014-09-05 20:32:13	sinix	antergos's gnome is pulled from arch's repo, and all I've got is arch and antergos around here :(
2014-09-05 20:32:58	sinix	does pidgin integrate with gnome? because empathy's gnome popups are really nice
2014-09-05 20:33:14	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: yah i'm using pidgin right now and it seems after i type like about 50 characters it seems to be a bit slower as I type
2014-09-05 20:33:33	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: same kind of issue with empathy as well
2014-09-05 20:33:44	vecchp	I don't see it in any other application as of yet though

2014-09-06 01:37:56	arshavin	hey anybody has idea about this internal stream error for totem
2014-09-06 01:39:13	arshavin	this problem has been around for months
2014-09-06 01:39:59	arshavin	AlexRussia: Hi
2014-09-06 01:40:32	AlexRussia	arshavin, ...
2014-09-06 01:40:43	AlexRussia	arshavin, lol
2014-09-06 01:44:19	arshavin	I never use totem,though,it seems to irritate whenever a video would play with totem,it just spews that error
2014-09-06 01:53:53	AlexRussia	arshavin, i think you should build vlc ;)
2014-09-06 01:55:24	arshavin	I did build vlc,I know vlc is enough but since I have totem too,I would like to have it working,not just spew some stupid error,when I open it
2014-09-06 01:55:59	AlexRussia	arshavin, for me totem always worked like crap, thats why i did not use it as default

2014-09-06 13:02:59	GabMus	hello people! quick question: i have installed antergos on my /dev/sdb (pretty old and small hdd) and now that i'm sure about it i want to install it on my /dev/sda, specifically i want to install the / partition replacing the one i am using for ubuntu and using ubuntu's same /home partition *without* formatting it. is this possible
2014-09-06 13:17:50	MichaelTunnell	GabMus: Ubuntu is massively different than Antergos so there is no reason to keep the home folder because your settings will be very different
2014-09-06 13:18:03	MichaelTunnell	I would suggest that you make a backup of all the files that you want to keep

2014-09-06 13:22:52	MichaelTunnell	you clone it for backup that is all

2014-09-07 11:51:00	zell1	True story
2014-09-07 11:51:58	zell1	So, I'm having an issue with connecting to a 3rd party VPN> I've put in all of the connection information and downloaded the CA certs and everything. However when I click connect to VPN nothing happens.
2014-09-07 11:52:13	zell1	Any ideas?
2014-09-07 11:53:45	MichaelTunnell	you need to contact the vpn support
2014-09-07 11:53:55	MichaelTunnell	it depends on the type of vpn and their setup
2014-09-07 11:54:02	MichaelTunnell	like if it is SOCKS or not
2014-09-07 11:54:05	MichaelTunnell	blah and other blahs
2014-09-07 11:55:28	zell1	Yeah I hear you there. I would think that it could be a problem there, but sadly I'm using the same configs I've used before when it has worked. Another thing which makes me think it's a local issue is that there is no notification that the machine is even trying to establish that connection. Should I still contact them or are them some network configs I should look at?

2014-09-07 11:57:48	MichaelTunnell	but it could be an issue with networkmanager
2014-09-07 11:57:49	MichaelTunnell	not sure
2014-09-07 11:58:02	MichaelTunnell	I like PIA super cheap vpn

2014-09-07 11:58:39	MichaelTunnell	cool though I dont know how good their support is so good luck
2014-09-07 11:58:41	zell1	Thanks for the help. I'll contact them and see what the deal is.

2014-09-07 12:24:29	illumniggati	Whenever I try to install it says "unable to write partitions"
2014-09-07 12:25:08	illumniggati	The hard drive shows up in Nautilus and I can browse it just fine, but in cfdisk and gparted it shows that its unallocated space.
2014-09-07 12:26:20	illumniggati	Anyone?
2014-09-07 12:26:47	MichaelTunnell	what is it formatted to?
2014-09-07 12:27:22	illumniggati	It has elementary os on it so, it should be ext4
2014-09-07 12:27:35	MichaelTunnell	are you trying for alongside or overwrite?
2014-09-07 12:27:41	illumniggati	Overwrite
2014-09-07 12:27:58	MichaelTunnell	so you dont care about the content on the drive?
2014-09-07 12:28:15	illumniggati	No, the important stuff is in dropbox and my music is on my phone.
2014-09-07 12:28:37	MichaelTunnell	why not just reformat it to ext4 and start with a clean drive
2014-09-07 12:28:44	MichaelTunnell	that will save you a lot of hassle
2014-09-07 12:29:30	illumniggati	How? I've never done that. Is it with mkfs?
2014-09-07 12:29:44	zell1	+1 for the reformat. I'm constantly switching back and forth between my gparted live iso and the target iso's
2014-09-07 12:30:03	illumniggati	(i'm not new to linux fyi)
2014-09-07 12:30:11	MichaelTunnell	illumniggati: you can just use GParted to do it
2014-09-07 12:30:58	MichaelTunnell	illumniggati: just delete the existing partitions and create a new on formatted to ext4 with GParted
2014-09-07 12:31:04	MichaelTunnell	then it will be clean for the install
2014-09-07 12:31:33	illumniggati	Oh okay, though there isn't any partitions showing. Don't know if that'll change anything.
2014-09-07 12:31:35	MichaelTunnell	delete and create and formatting...etc all can be done in GParted...such a great app
2014-09-07 12:31:39	illumniggati	I'll try that though
2014-09-07 12:32:15	MichaelTunnell	GParted will overwrite it in that case and the same outcome will occur so either way new partition with clean drive will be what you end up with
2014-09-07 12:32:24	illumniggati	Its saying there was an error

2014-09-07 12:35:03	illumniggati	I created a new partition table, in GPT. Its saying "Partition(s) 1 on /dev/sdb have been written, but we have been unable to inform the kernel of the change, probably because it/they are in use.  As a result, the old partition(s) will remain in use.  You should reboot now before making further changes.:
2014-09-07 12:35:38	MichaelTunnell	the drive should not be mounted when you are making these changes
2014-09-07 12:35:57	illumniggati	Oh well that might be the problem..heh..heh.....
2014-09-07 12:37:28	illumniggati	That's most likely the dumbest thing I've ever done (or forgot to do) in linux
2014-09-07 12:38:06	illumniggati	Attempting to install again now
2014-09-07 12:40:20	illumniggati	Its working now.. god I feel stupid right now. Thanks Michael, I probably would not have remembered the HDD was mounted.
2014-09-07 12:40:58	MichaelTunnell	:) illumniggati you're welcome. This kind of things happens to all of us
2014-09-07 12:41:23	MichaelTunnell	when I am writing code I often forget stupid little things like the ending ; on a line somewhere
2014-09-07 12:42:05	illumniggati	(: I might be back in a bit to let you know if it worked or not. And yeah haha.
2014-09-07 12:42:09	MichaelTunnell	it makes sense that when we start doing more advanced stuff we sometimes forget the silly basics...all we can do is laugh it off and move on :)
2014-09-07 12:42:18	MichaelTunnell	illumniggati: alright good luck
2014-09-07 12:42:41	illumniggati	Thanks!
2014-09-07 12:43:05	zell1	I've had that happen a lot, especially when using Gparted on Arch. it'll give me that error that I need to reboot. Sure enough when I log back in and run lsblk it shows that the drive has been formatted.
2014-09-07 12:43:48	MichaelTunnell	zell1: the reboot is also a form of unmounting :)

2014-09-07 12:45:14	illumniggati	Yeah, well i didn't exactly want to reboot in this scenario. My computer is crap haha, the laptop screen doesn't work so I can't get into bios to change the boot order.. so I have to take out the hard drive to be able to boot from my USB. Not exactly fun to do haha
2014-09-07 12:45:44	zell1	damn lol are you running it to a seperate screen to see what you're doing?
2014-09-07 12:46:32	illumniggati	Yeah, I've got it hooked up to a TV to see what I'm doing. It took a while to get used to at first haha
2014-09-07 12:47:44	zell1	lol word. Gotta do what you gotta do. another reason why I fall back to Antergos is because I use a TV for my main rig. Trying to do a base arch install is impossible because the screen settings cut off most of the command line :/
2014-09-07 12:48:31	illumniggati	Yeah, thats the main reason why I was scared to do an actual Arch install. I wasn't sure if my TV was going to be picked up by Arch.
2014-09-07 12:50:20	illumniggati	But now I'm installing antergos, and I think I'm most likely going to love it haha.
2014-09-07 12:52:18	zell1	I honestly believe you will. especially since it gets rid of the headaches that can sometimes arise from a base arch install. Plus you can install a quick VM easy
2014-09-07 12:52:22	zell1	WM*
2014-09-07 12:53:13	illumniggati	Yeah, I'm going with Openbox. I used it with #! and loved how fast it was. I also love the customizability.
2014-09-07 12:56:47	zell1	Nice. I'm going to give awesome a try. Never used it before. Hoping for a great success
2014-09-07 12:58:28	illumniggati	Awesome doesn't appeal to me honestly, not sure why.
2014-09-07 13:01:16	zell1	yeah It's going to be a test run. we'll see how it goes
2014-09-07 13:02:05	illumniggati	Yeah, I hope it goes well for you. If you haven't already, go to http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn for some inspiration, if you need it.

2014-09-07 13:25:40	zell1	antergos should do that all automatically for you
2014-09-07 13:25:45	zell1	yeah
2014-09-07 13:26:02	illumniggati	Almost freaked out there for a second haha
2014-09-07 13:27:44	zell1	lol yeah man. Antergos for the most part sets up everything for you so that you don't have to mess around with the bigger things. That being said, I would still recommend at some point doing a base arch install. It'll get you familiar with a lot of what's going on in the background, plus it gives you a strong sense of accomplishment when you get that bastard running.
2014-09-07 13:28:02	zell1	(if you haven't already)
2014-09-07 13:28:44	illumniggati	I've done so in vbox before. It seemed simple enough. But like I had previously states, I'm not sure if it'll recognize my tv when I boot it.

2014-09-07 13:31:10	zell1	Cool, then yeah antergos is the way to go. Por ejamplo, I just tried to install a base arch and it failed when installing grub. Since I'm doing more than one install today I'm just going to say eff it and run with Antergos. Then I'll install the specific WM's after.
2014-09-07 13:32:07	illumniggati	Yeah, thats a good thing about Arch in general. Don't like something? Uninstall it, it'll be fine. (for the most part)
2014-09-07 13:32:34	zell1	truth
2014-09-07 13:38:28	zell1	What makes you like openbox? What's better about it than say Gnome or Cinnamon?

2014-09-07 13:45:31	illumniggati	I like it more because its just simple, and it doesn't have features I won't use.
2014-09-07 13:46:11	illumniggati	Also its customizable
2014-09-07 13:47:47	zell1	Ah ok. I'm going to give openbox a shot. Any good resources besides that subreddit to customize openbox
2014-09-07 13:47:50	zell1	?
2014-09-07 13:49:57	illumniggati	A good place to start is #! forums, also just look up how to customize openbox haha.
2014-09-07 13:51:13	zell1	lol gotcha
2014-09-07 13:54:54	illumniggati	Its relatively easy to customize though.. All it really is is editing values and adding a few lines here and there
2014-09-07 13:59:02	illumniggati	You have to look up color codes quite a bit though haha

2014-09-07 14:06:41	illumniggati	Also, openbox has no task bar, screenshots show it. But it doesn't, so get tint2 if you want an easy task bar to use.
2014-09-07 14:07:34	illumniggati	Or you can get a dock such as Cairo or Plank

2014-09-09 14:41:15	sanic	The willie wagtail is a passerine bird native to Australia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and eastern Indonesia. It is a common and familiar bird throughout much of its range, living in most habitats apart from thick forest. Measuring 19.0–21.5 cm (7½–8½ in) in length, the willie wagtail is contrastingly coloured with almost entirely black upperparts and white underparts; the male and female have similar plum

2014-09-09 20:27:21	vecchp	has anyone tried to upgrade pepper flash today?
2014-09-09 20:53:35	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: isn't pepper flash restricted to Chrome and thus need chrome to update?
2014-09-09 21:13:02	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: Well pepper flash is beasically a seperate package. It downloads chrome and then extracts it to be used with chromium since chromium doesn't ship with it
2014-09-09 21:13:55	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: The rpm in the AUR package wouldn't download because I think of a bad link or something.  But i decided to just switch straight to Chrome since I thought it was silly that it basically downlaoded all of chrome to pull out pepper flash to use for chromium
2014-09-09 21:14:06	MichaelTunnell	I dont see the point in using Chromium if people are going to use the crap that Chrome has...just use chrome
2014-09-09 21:14:19	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: exactly
2014-09-09 21:14:28	MichaelTunnell	I prefer Firefox though
2014-09-09 21:15:03	MichaelTunnell	people do that with Chromium so they can lie to themselves about using Open Source Browser...I use Firefox because it actually is fully Open Source
2014-09-09 21:15:19	MichaelTunnell	plus it is just overall better to me and has a LOT more useful features
2014-09-09 21:15:26	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I get mixed feelings between the two.  I actually used Firefox only for the last like 10 or so years.
2014-09-09 21:15:43	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: but lately I've just liked the feel of chrome for some reason
2014-09-09 21:16:04	MichaelTunnell	Firefox is better to many in so many ways...the addons are unbeatable and the APIs are fantastic
2014-09-09 21:16:14	MichaelTunnell	what about the "feel" do you like
2014-09-09 21:16:39	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I think it is the compositing that chrome does.  It just feels smoother
2014-09-09 21:16:42	MichaelTunnell	a lot of people are saying that Firefox feels a lot like Chrome now...I disagree but I do understand why they say that
2014-09-09 21:17:38	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: However for both browsers the only addons i really use are adblock and a flash downloader if I ever need to grab something off a page
2014-09-09 21:19:08	MichaelTunnell	you are missing out a lot then

2014-09-09 23:20:07	MichaelTunnell	whoa that is weird
2014-09-09 23:20:33	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: I have a 1TB drive and 8GB or ram. So i don't know why i would suddenly be out of space
2014-09-09 23:21:19	MichaelTunnell	yea that doesnt make sense...I would guess that you recently installed an app that doesnt allocate memory correctly and is causing this entirely
2014-09-09 23:21:24	MichaelTunnell	what that could be...no idea
2014-09-09 23:21:41	vecchp	this is when building something from aur
2014-09-09 23:21:57	vecchp	I'm not getting this problem with regular things
2014-09-09 23:22:10	vecchp	i'm trying to pull the cuda6 package
2014-09-09 23:23:01	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: i have a freeling the default tempfs settings in Antergos are incorrect
2014-09-09 23:25:48	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: nevermind i think i just need to build the package outside of tempfs

2014-09-09 23:49:25	nardusg	question... Installed the catalyst drivers. I got an hybrid amd card, intel/amd. So it is working but. I got a screen plugged into the HDMI port. When I plug it in the laptop lcd turns off ? Any ideas ?
2014-09-09 23:51:18	vecchp	nardusg: is it swapping drivers from intel to amd?
2014-09-09 23:51:30	vecchp	nardusg: or can you see if the displays are listed in your display config?

2014-09-09 23:57:19	nardusg_	let me have a look and see... thanks
2014-09-09 23:57:23	vecchp	are you using the open source or proprietary driver?
2014-09-09 23:57:41	nardusg_	you beat me to it but did not really knew how to frase the g search

2014-09-10 00:01:50	vecchp	at least it is workign
2014-09-10 00:02:12	vecchp	by the way I've heard that the open source amd drivers are actually pretty good depending on which card you have.
2014-09-10 00:02:35	vecchp	so it might be worth trying them out when you have a chance
2014-09-10 00:03:33	nardusg_	thanks... will have a look. i am after better bat life. on radeon I only get 1 hour. on catalyst and intel it jums to almos 2:30
2014-09-10 00:04:39	vecchp	nardusg_: well then that works.  To be honest I was never happy with linux on laptops for long since I could never get the same bat life i'd get in windows... but that was like 5 years ago so maybe its better now
2014-09-10 00:05:52	nardusg_	been most my life on laptops, nature of my work... but I think I came to an end on amd, never again.
2014-09-10 00:11:35	vecchp	nardusg_: why is that?
2014-09-10 00:13:05	nardusg_	mission to get going...
2014-09-10 00:13:38	nardusg_	antergos/arch is the only distro that works with gnome 3.12

2014-09-10 00:14:44	vecchp	nardusg_: pretty sure  ubuntu works too

2014-09-10 00:57:02	MichaelTunnell	qdata:
2014-09-10 00:57:53	qdata	how did you make it work - it doesn't seem to do so when installed, must be some magic involved
2014-09-10 00:58:13	qdata	Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-enp6s0' (VERR_SUPDRV_COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND).
2014-09-10 00:58:27	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: so far there is nothing in GNOME that I dont like that I cant change...well there is one thing, I can change it but it is kind of a pain so I am making an extension for it
2014-09-10 00:58:47	qdata	wiki said the modules for hostonly networking were optional and since I don't use ...
2014-09-10 00:58:57	qdata	sigh
2014-09-10 00:59:25	MichaelTunnell	qdata: I use hostonly networking all the time so I do need them which was the only issue I had
2014-09-10 00:59:32	MichaelTunnell	everything else worked out of the virtualbox
2014-09-10 00:59:35	MichaelTunnell	hah pubs
2014-09-10 00:59:37	MichaelTunnell	puns
2014-09-10 00:59:42	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: One thing i think I want to change is the ability to add more specific intervals of screen blanking. I think the highest you can go is 15 in the drop down menu
2014-09-10 01:00:16	MichaelTunnell	anyway I dont know how to fix the issue you have because I did not experience that...the hostonly issues that I experienced I fixed and updated the wiki...you read my contribution
2014-09-10 01:00:17	MichaelTunnell	YAY
2014-09-10 01:00:31	qdata	I use bridged networling and never host only
2014-09-10 01:00:34	MichaelTunnell	screen blanking? wtf is that
2014-09-10 01:00:52	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: like when it goes into power saving lol
2014-09-10 01:01:03	MichaelTunnell	qdata: right so not relevant so I am not sure what the exact issue is...you will need to go to the virtualbox channel or the arch channel
2014-09-10 01:01:16	MichaelTunnell	interesting
2014-09-10 01:01:18	qdata	looks like to me the error means it needs them anyway, even though the wiki said they were optional
2014-09-10 01:01:25	MichaelTunnell	well I need to go to sleep so see you all later
2014-09-10 01:01:35	qdata	sleep well  :-)
2014-09-10 01:02:20	MichaelTunnell	thanks...they should be optional...you might be having a separate issue....though maybe they are needed for bridged...not sure...normal networking type is NAT so it might be referring to default setups not needing them
2014-09-10 01:02:39	MichaelTunnell	if you install them and it works then please let me know so I can address it on the wiki

2014-09-10 01:26:00	nardusg_	you got all the modules loaded ?
2014-09-10 01:26:56	qdata	yes - added the two to the module conf file and rebooted - vbox seems to be working now -almost
2014-09-10 01:27:29	qdata	error is gone and I almost got a winXP VM installed but it seems to have froze up on me
2014-09-10 01:27:30	nardusg_	so what is still outstanding ?
2014-09-10 01:28:44	qdata	my guess is the package was built with ./configure switches that require it to have those modules present irregardless of host-only networking choice
2014-09-10 01:29:29	qdata	I use bridged networking and since the wiki said they were optional I didn't load them
2014-09-10 01:30:31	qdata	seems like the way it was compiled they are not optional
2014-09-10 01:32:31	qdata	so virtualbox is now working
2014-09-10 01:34:13	qdata	I originally had vboxdrv by itself, but added vboxnetadp and vboxnetflt

2014-09-11 19:56:10	juicebox	:P
2014-09-11 19:56:24	gooberfoob	look.... i can explain...
2014-09-11 19:56:45	gooberfoob	hahaha im ashamed...
2014-09-11 19:56:51	gooberfoob	(walks away)
2014-09-11 19:57:22	gooberfoob	ok... maybe I will ask a less punch worthy question...
2014-09-11 19:58:11	gooberfoob	I have been googling how to install nvidia drives on antergos.. and when I run NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-331.17.run it says i need to quit x server.. so I do
2014-09-11 19:58:32	gooberfoob	but, it still does not run and install
2014-09-11 19:59:30	gooberfoob	yes, I am a noob to arch related anything.
2014-09-11 20:02:56	Pentium44	gooberfoob
2014-09-11 20:02:58	Pentium44	do this:
2014-09-11 20:03:11	Pentium44	sudo pacman -S nvidia
2014-09-11 20:03:22	Pentium44	arch has nvidia drivers in the repo
2014-09-11 20:03:56	Pentium44	and also install nvidia-libgl
2014-09-11 20:04:01	gooberfoob	i did that before and it give me the error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
2014-09-11 20:04:01	gooberfoob	:: nouveau-dri: requires mesa-libgl
2014-09-11 20:04:23	gooberfoob	srry for not using pastbin
2014-09-11 20:04:31	Pentium44	try updating your database
2014-09-11 20:04:35	Pentium44	sudo pacman -Syu
2014-09-11 20:04:41	Pentium44	system*
2014-09-11 20:05:27	Pentium44	gooberfoob, btw, install nvidia not nouveau
2014-09-11 20:05:36	gooberfoob	same error even after update
2014-09-11 20:05:59	gooberfoob	do i need to remove nouveau-dri ?
2014-09-11 20:06:02	Pentium44	okay, pastebin everything from when you ran the update command
2014-09-11 20:06:10	Pentium44	gooberfoob, most likely
2014-09-11 20:06:12	Pentium44	I had to
2014-09-11 20:06:16	Pentium44	what nvidia card do you have?
2014-09-11 20:07:17	Pentium44	gooberfoob: sudo pacman -R xf86-video-nouveau
2014-09-11 20:07:23	Pentium44	then try installing nvidia
2014-09-11 20:07:31	gooberfoob	graphics card is a nvidia (geforce gtx 560)
2014-09-11 20:08:39	gooberfoob	here are the results you asked for http://pastebin.com/dCExK1rE
2014-09-11 20:10:07	Pentium44	yep
2014-09-11 20:10:25	Pentium44	removing xf86-video-nouveau and if that doesn't remove nouveau-dri, remove it too
2014-09-11 20:10:28	Pentium44	then install nvidia
2014-09-11 20:10:49	gooberfoob	srry to ask this but in this arch how do you remove
2014-09-11 20:10:55	gooberfoob	im used to debian wheezy
2014-09-11 20:12:45	gooberfoob	nvm
2014-09-11 20:12:55	gooberfoob	i just found pamanxg
2014-09-11 20:13:02	gooberfoob	*pacmanxg
2014-09-11 20:13:17	gooberfoob	I usually use the terminal
2014-09-11 20:15:34	gooberfoob	so i cant remove it because lib32-nouveau-dri requires nouveau-dri
2014-09-11 20:16:31	gooberfoob	so i removed them both
2014-09-11 20:16:48	gooberfoob	now i am able to downlod
2014-09-11 20:17:15	gooberfoob	I need to reboot.. hopefully this works THANKS !!!

2014-09-11 20:43:11	wardhan	hi all. i need help finding a package. it is used to download movies. itautomatically configures servers & shows no of files, health & shows no of seeders also. i was using in debian but coompletly forgot the name
2014-09-11 20:44:19	wardhan	i installed pan but it is lacking all the features i remembered
2014-09-11 20:47:16	Pentium44	gooberfoob, how is it?
2014-09-11 20:47:41	Pentium44	and gooberfoob, for installing steam:
2014-09-11 20:47:52	Pentium44	sudo pacman -S steam
2014-09-11 20:47:55	Pentium44	run that command
2014-09-11 20:48:00	gooberfoob	I enabled multilib
2014-09-11 20:48:30	gooberfoob	I get target not found: steam
2014-09-11 20:48:57	Pentium44	do: pacman -Ss steam
2014-09-11 20:49:28	Pentium44	that will list the steam packages
2014-09-11 20:49:40	gooberfoob	actually, nothing happened haha
2014-09-11 20:50:03	Pentium44	???
2014-09-11 20:50:05	Pentium44	thats weird
2014-09-11 20:50:10	Pentium44	I get the steam packages
2014-09-11 20:50:23	gooberfoob	yeah... i been reading the wiki and it should install pretty easyy
2014-09-11 20:50:34	Pentium44	https://pastee.org/r9jbw
2014-09-11 20:51:06	Pentium44	gooberfoob, what repo mirror are you using?
2014-09-11 20:51:46	gooberfoob	where is that list located ?
2014-09-11 20:52:54	Pentium44	gooberfoob: cat /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

2014-09-11 21:02:30	gooberfoob	my mirror list is the normal antergos mirror list
2014-09-11 21:03:35	gooberfoob	actually i just looked and mine is different then the archlinux.org/mirrorlist
2014-09-11 21:05:05	gooberfoob	im gonna change them
2014-09-11 21:05:07	MichaelTunnell	I havent read the whole backlog but you NEED to remove nouveau drivers before installing nvidia drivers
2014-09-11 21:05:28	MichaelTunnell	and there will be something that will still conflict
2014-09-11 21:05:31	gooberfoob	you are a little late to the game hahah I already fixed that
2014-09-11 21:05:37	MichaelTunnell	I dont remember what it is that still conflicts
2014-09-11 21:05:51	gooberfoob	I fixed it and my nvidia drivers are install
2014-09-11 21:05:54	gooberfoob	*installed
2014-09-11 21:06:34	gooberfoob	and now I been trying to install steam, and I am looking at my mirror list and it is different then this https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=US
2014-09-11 21:07:11	gooberfoob	and here is my current list http://pastebin.com/B9WJTtmf
2014-09-11 21:07:36	MichaelTunnell	gooberfoob: do you have multilibs enabled? you need this for steam
2014-09-11 21:07:53	gooberfoob	yes, but I cant install because it says steam is not found
2014-09-11 21:08:00	gooberfoob	so i think something is wrong with my mirror list
2014-09-11 21:08:14	gooberfoob	so I was trying to explain that I think I need to change it
2014-09-11 21:08:45	MichaelTunnell	Antergos has the right mirrorlist by default you just need to enable multilibs
2014-09-11 21:08:58	gooberfoob	I did
2014-09-11 21:08:59	MichaelTunnell	did you remove the comment from both lines in the conf file?
2014-09-11 21:09:03	gooberfoob	yes
2014-09-11 21:09:10	Pentium44	This is odd
2014-09-11 21:09:25	MichaelTunnell	did you update the list after you enabled them?
2014-09-11 21:09:26	Pentium44	I am running 32bit, and it should work fine in 64bit too
2014-09-11 21:09:31	MichaelTunnell	sudo pacman -Syu
2014-09-11 21:10:10	MichaelTunnell	I run 64 and I installed 32 multilibs and refreshed the list with Syu and bam installs
2014-09-11 21:10:23	MichaelTunnell	if you dont refresh it will fail
2014-09-11 21:10:47	gooberfoob	I did that, and when i do sudo pacman -S steam I get the result : error:target not found: steam
2014-09-11 21:20:15	Pentium44	gooberfoob, did you paste the mirrorlist file?
2014-09-11 21:20:21	Pentium44	just so we can make sure its correct
2014-09-11 21:22:30	MichaelTunnell	he did Pentium44 scroll up...pastebin link
2014-09-11 21:23:39	MichaelTunnell	and he does have leaseweb which pacman should be using to get steam
2014-09-11 21:24:53	Pentium44	I use mirrors.kernel.org as my main MichaelTunnell
2014-09-11 21:25:10	gooberfoob	yeah i pasted it
2014-09-11 21:25:19	MichaelTunnell	I dont even have that at all Pentium44
2014-09-11 21:25:28	MichaelTunnell	I use leaseweb as my primary
2014-09-11 21:25:29	Pentium44	gooberfoob, try moving Server = ...mirrors.kernel.org... to the top
2014-09-11 21:25:41	Pentium44	MichaelTunnell, they should both work
2014-09-11 21:25:47	MichaelTunnell	gooberfoob: yep worth a shot
2014-09-11 21:29:10	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, why would you need the nouveou drivers before the nvidia ones?
2014-09-11 21:29:15	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, I never saw that

2014-09-11 21:30:13	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, and it was usually the mesa glx that would conflict if you switched between the two.  I don't think they conflict now though.  Either way removing it was fine since nvidia-glx could replace it
2014-09-11 21:30:40	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: nvidia is proprietary drivers for nvidia cards. nouveau drivers are the open source drivers for nvidia cards
2014-09-11 21:30:48	MichaelTunnell	they cant not be installed at the same time
2014-09-11 21:30:52	MichaelTunnell	they cause conflicts and breaks

2014-09-11 21:31:47	MichaelTunnell	Pentium44: he left

2014-09-11 21:42:38	Pentium44	hi
2014-09-11 21:45:19	MichaelTunnell	hi
2014-09-11 21:46:22	lovera1n	a friend of mine recommended antergos for me and I'm trying on VMWare... looks awesome :]
2014-09-11 21:49:05	MichaelTunnell	lovera1n: how familiar are you with Linux?
2014-09-11 21:49:25	MichaelTunnell	have you used it before and if so for how long lovera1n
2014-09-11 21:49:31	lovera1n	i've used debian-based distros for a while
2014-09-11 21:49:58	MichaelTunnell	what is "a while", just trying to get a basis
2014-09-11 21:51:04	lovera1n	i used ubuntu/mint/tried fedora in 2011-2012 on a old notebook and currently i use ubuntu com vmware for college
2014-09-11 21:51:19	lovera1n	back then i used on dualboot
2014-09-11 21:52:05	lovera1n	on vmware*
2014-09-11 21:52:24	MichaelTunnell	ok cool then Antergos could be a good option
2014-09-11 21:52:38	MichaelTunnell	how familiar are you with Arch?
2014-09-11 21:52:57	lovera1n	i only know by name... never tried to install or use before
2014-09-11 21:53:21	MichaelTunnell	the reason I am asking is because Arch is very different than anything based on Debian
2014-09-11 21:53:56	MichaelTunnell	Arch is super powerful but it also needs a lot of attention given to it...Antergos is basically Arch with a bit of polishing so you will essentially be using Arch once you install it
2014-09-11 21:54:18	MichaelTunnell	everything you know about apt-get is irrelevant in Antergos/Arch
2014-09-11 21:54:53	lovera1n	i'm aware.. it uses yaourt right?
2014-09-11 21:55:01	MichaelTunnell	lovera1n: yes and no
2014-09-11 21:55:19	MichaelTunnell	PPAs are not relevant either though the AUR is kind of something similar
2014-09-11 21:55:43	MichaelTunnell	so basically Antergos and Arch is a very techincal system and stuff gets updated INCREDIBLY fast
2014-09-11 21:57:09	MichaelTunnell	the problem with that is that things can break because they are so fast with updates
2014-09-11 21:57:51	lovera1n	in the future perhaps I will try to use dualboot on my current computer but it uses UEFI and two GPUs and I don't know if it will work smoothly
2014-09-11 21:58:50	MichaelTunnell	Antergos/Arch supports basically everything that Linux can support so yea sure it can do that
2014-09-11 21:59:14	MichaelTunnell	the only issue is that Windows 8 basically hates everything not Windows 8 so I have never done a dual boot with in distro and Win8
2014-09-11 22:00:09	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is quite awesome and if you are prepared to deal with the occasional quirk you will love Antergos speed and compatibility because Antergos/Arch usually has support for any app ever made
2014-09-11 22:00:52	MichaelTunnell	I just wanted you to be prepared before you tried it because it can be scary even to Linux veterans
2014-09-11 22:01:00	MichaelTunnell	so anyway
2014-09-11 22:01:19	MichaelTunnell	pacman provides the same function that apt-get does but for the official repos
2014-09-11 22:01:45	MichaelTunnell	yaourt is for the AUR so you would use yaourt when installing from the AUR and pacman when installing from the official repos.
2014-09-11 22:01:56	MichaelTunnell	the syntax is the same though
2014-09-11 22:02:11	MichaelTunnell	sudo pacman -S appname
2014-09-11 22:02:17	MichaelTunnell	sudo yaourt -S appname
2014-09-11 22:02:33	MichaelTunnell	you just need to know which app is in which repo

2014-09-11 22:03:09	MichaelTunnell	also AUR is mostly Beta and Git versions so if you only want to use stable packages you wont need the AUR
2014-09-11 22:03:50	MichaelTunnell	there are a few packages that only exist in the AUR and not in the main repo but they are rare...usually there is a Main Repo version and an AUR beta version

2014-09-11 22:05:19	MichaelTunnell	an example of this is Firefox. There is a stable Firefox which is in the main repo. There are also Beta, Aurora and Nightly versions in the AUR. The Nightly version is the most unstable version of Firefox so if you dont want to do testing then should maybe avoid that one. (I like testing so I use that one)

2014-09-11 22:45:43	lovera1n	i used the open-vm-tools package
2014-09-11 22:45:45	lovera1n	it kinda works

2014-09-11 22:47:41	lovera1n	i can make it fullscreen but I cant swap files between host and guest and it gave me a warning that it isn't using hardware acceleration on boot

2014-09-12 01:30:37	vecchp	I get so anal about prefect dialog and i still am not happy with it lol
2014-09-12 01:30:54	vecchp	i spent like an hour working on a 4 minute clip
2014-09-12 01:32:15	Noxbru	perfect dialog? it has to be natural :)
2014-09-12 01:32:38	vecchp	well i mean like no stuttering or mistake or brainfarts
2014-09-12 01:33:02	vecchp	i prefer natural but i try to keep the mistakes at a minimum
2014-09-12 01:33:08	vecchp	especially when i'm doing a tutorial
2014-09-12 01:33:42	Noxbru	maybe, but mistakes are also a part of natural speech
2014-09-12 01:34:10	Noxbru	and you can always record your voice after recording
2014-09-12 01:34:56	vecchp	Noxbru, yah i know.  the audio is what i've been working on so much
2014-09-12 01:35:53	Noxbru	then... maybe subtitles?
2014-09-12 01:36:03	vecchp	i'm pretty impressed on how capable blender is for video editing.  I would have never though of using it until i searched google for linux video editors
2014-09-12 01:36:44	Noxbru	blender? really? I have always thought that editing video with blender would be like killing flies with tanks
2014-09-12 01:37:36	vecchp	Noxbru, lol well it seems to work pretty well.  Plus i guess if you ever want to do 3D effects it's already built in
2014-09-12 01:37:54	vecchp	plus it kind of gives me an excuse to get more familiar with bledner

2014-09-12 11:16:56	Noxbru	gooberfoob: what do you mean?
2014-09-12 11:17:08	Noxbru	steam is a package in Arch's repos

2014-09-12 11:17:50	Noxbru	okay... 32 or 64 bits?
2014-09-12 11:17:59	gooberfoob	64bit
2014-09-12 11:18:01	Noxbru	have you done before 'sudo pacman -Syy' ?
2014-09-12 11:18:07	gooberfoob	no
2014-09-12 11:18:14	gooberfoob	what does that do ?
2014-09-12 11:18:25	Noxbru	okay... do you have the multilib repo enabled?
2014-09-12 11:18:32	gooberfoob	yeah i did that
2014-09-12 11:18:42	gooberfoob	and updated and everything
2014-09-12 11:18:52	Noxbru	then it's strange...
2014-09-12 11:19:06	Noxbru	could you see if the command that I have written improves anything?
2014-09-12 11:19:20	Noxbru	it should update your package databases
2014-09-12 11:19:46	gooberfoob	im running that commandn ow
2014-09-12 11:19:49	gooberfoob	*now

2014-09-12 11:20:56	gooberfoob	I have not changed my mirror list at all
2014-09-12 11:21:06	gooberfoob	so whatever antergos had set up is the same
2014-09-12 11:21:16	Noxbru	then you haven't enabled multilib?
2014-09-12 11:21:26	gooberfoob	well i enabled that
2014-09-12 11:21:37	Noxbru	then it should find steam

2014-09-12 11:22:44	Noxbru	what do you have exactly in your pacman.conf for multilib?
2014-09-12 11:22:54	Noxbru	it should be:
2014-09-12 11:22:57	Noxbru	[multilib]
2014-09-12 11:22:59	Noxbru	SigLevel = PackageRequired

2014-09-12 11:23:54	Noxbru	what was the problem, if I may ask?
2014-09-12 11:24:27	gooberfoob	there is multilib testing and multilib and I only enabled testing

2014-09-12 11:26:20	gooberfoob	Well, I have noticed that antergos is a pretty decent distro

2014-09-12 11:27:10	Noxbru	Antergos is a very nice way to start with Arch without having to do all the installation process
2014-09-12 11:27:23	Noxbru	altough I'd recommend you to do it at least one time :)
2014-09-12 11:27:33	Noxbru	for learning purposes, I mean
2014-09-12 11:28:25	gooberfoob	Yea, I agree. I have no problem with the partition creation part. I understand how to do that. I feel the manual install of eveyrthing else is, what I need to learn.
2014-09-12 11:29:20	Noxbru	that's not a hard part, you just have to install a couple of packages and build your system up
2014-09-12 11:30:02	Noxbru	besides, the beginners guide is *really* helpful
2014-09-12 11:30:20	gooberfoob	O NO !!! i got the dredded opengl glx contex is not using direct rendering...
2014-09-12 11:30:40	Noxbru	the what?
2014-09-12 11:31:35	gooberfoob	I get an error as i start steam that opengl glx contex is no using direct rendering

2014-09-12 11:31:45	Noxbru	don't worry
2014-09-12 11:32:02	Noxbru	that's a problem with steam, but there's a workaround

2014-09-12 11:33:59	Noxbru	as optional dependency you have the lib32- version of your drivers
2014-09-12 11:34:03	Noxbru	install that
2014-09-12 11:34:26	gooberfoob	yeah thats what I was trying to get at
2014-09-12 11:34:31	gooberfoob	-.-
2014-09-12 11:34:33	Noxbru	then you will have to 'move' a library that comes bundled with steam
2014-09-12 11:34:47	gooberfoob	do i really need to worry about it ?
2014-09-12 11:34:49	Noxbru	but I have to remember which one
2014-09-12 11:34:51	Noxbru	no
2014-09-12 11:35:21	Noxbru	the problem is that the c++ library that comes with steam is different to the one we have in Antergos
2014-09-12 11:35:25	gooberfoob	when i look at my nvidia x server settign it says direct rendering: ye
2014-09-12 11:35:30	gooberfoob	*yes
2014-09-12 11:35:32	Noxbru	I know
2014-09-12 11:35:50	Noxbru	it happens the same with AMD, it is a known issue, don't worry
2014-09-12 11:35:59	gooberfoob	#yolo
2014-09-12 11:36:01	gooberfoob	ha
2014-09-12 11:37:06	Noxbru	ok, here it is...
2014-09-12 11:37:17	Noxbru	go to ~/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
2014-09-12 11:37:55	Noxbru	there's a file there called 'libstdc++.so.6'
2014-09-12 11:38:12	Noxbru	rename it to something different (I have libstdc++.so.6.bak)

2014-09-13 04:48:45	installingAnterg	what are your views on running it on a system with 2GB ram and 160 GB storage with running GNOME ?
2014-09-13 04:49:50	installingAnterg	the laptop will be used for normal day to day use spreadsheet/ basic development (shell/python/java)
2014-09-13 05:02:44	zell1	What processor are you using?
2014-09-13 05:20:46	installingAnterg	its and intel duo T7500 @2.2GHZ

2014-09-13 05:32:36	zell1	Well since you're using less than 4GB I'd go with a 32bit version. But yeah you should be fine
2014-09-13 05:32:49	zell1	Just know that Gnome with all it's stuff tends to be a heavier VM

2014-09-13 05:33:31	installingAnterg	okay, installed it, we'll see how we go

2014-09-13 06:05:57	stil	hi all may i please ask about installation of antergos. my english is not much fluent hope you can understand me
2014-09-13 06:06:16	zell1	Speaking of video drivers I'm trying to switch from the open source drivers to the proprietary catalyst drivers. I'm doing this to get better support for a rig that has 2 AMD video cards. What would be the best way to go about this switch without breaking Arch?
2014-09-13 06:06:27	zell1	stil What is your question?
2014-09-13 06:10:56	stil	zell1:  i was installing antergos in a partiton of the disk too small then i downloaded 1Gb of packages but i can't finalize the installation. now i have risized the partition  and i would like to installa the restant packages that are in /var/cache/pacman/pkgs. i am chrooting the  partition  and i would like to know if there is some pacman comand for utilize the content of /var...../pkgs
2014-09-13 06:15:02	stil	my problem is that i luck of internet connection than i would like to try to arrange what  i have instead of reinstall  or download newly from beginning. do you think it's possible zell1
2014-09-13 06:15:23	<--	csoriano89_ (~carlos@92.57.109.143) has quit (Quit: csoriano89_)
2014-09-13 06:17:50	zell1	stil: I would restart the download of the package just to be sure I received it all and that there is less of a chance for corruption. From what I understand, if a download is interrupted, it will still be held in a tmp file. So when you run the command to install, it should start where you left off.
2014-09-13 06:18:02	zell1	Does anyone else have a different experience with this sort of thing?
2014-09-13 06:18:29	stil	ci can confirm that the download was complete
2014-09-13 06:18:38	stil	*I
2014-09-13 06:19:49	stil	the installation was at 80% then i received the notification of luck of space
2014-09-13 06:21:04	stil	i did a complete download of less then 1GB
2014-09-13 06:21:48	stil	and all the packages are in  /var/cache/pacman/pkgs
2014-09-13 06:23:25	zell1	stil: ok in that case you still shouldn't have a problem running the install command again. It'll just verify all of the packages and contents then install it.
2014-09-13 06:23:58	zell1	Unless you are compiling it yourself. If that is that case, I'm afraid I do not know much about that topic.
2014-09-13 06:26:28	stil	actually i did pacman -Syu and asked to download mor 33 MB 40 packages but at the and there was a problem in gpg key then stopped the installation of this rest of packages zell1
2014-09-13 06:26:42	stil	*more
2014-09-13 06:27:49	zell1	stil: Ok try this: sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
2014-09-13 06:27:57	zell1	Then try to run the command againd
2014-09-13 06:28:00	zell1	again*

2014-09-13 12:10:07	SomehowIForgot	I believe you may be correct in such an assumption, Noxbru. Thank you.
2014-09-13 12:10:16	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: there is an update-grub but it is a debian thing
2014-09-13 12:10:19	MichaelTunnell_	in arch it is this
2014-09-13 12:10:21	MichaelTunnell_	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2014-09-13 12:10:57	MichaelTunnell_	update-grub in debian basically is just a script to run the above command easier
2014-09-13 12:10:59	SomehowIForgot	Stupidly enough, on my Ubuntu based system (Just for laughs and tests) I ran sudo grub-mkconfig
2014-09-13 12:11:04	SomehowIForgot	Without any flags and values after it,
2014-09-13 12:11:12	shndns	what enviroment did you guys go with
2014-09-13 12:11:22	Noxbru	it just prints the updated grub to stdout
2014-09-13 12:11:29	Noxbru	shndns: gnome-shell here
2014-09-13 12:11:32	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: are you asking anyone what they used?
2014-09-13 12:11:39	shndns	yeah
2014-09-13 12:11:39	SomehowIForgot	That's nice. Glad I didn't accidentally ruin anything Noxbru.
2014-09-13 12:11:47	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: I use GNOME 3
2014-09-13 12:11:53	qdata	update-grub was for old grub, for grub2 edit /etc/default/grub then do grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, for the CLI approach
2014-09-13 12:12:35	MichaelTunnell_	qdata: yes but Debian and Ubuntu still have update-grub which creates the confusion for people moving over.
2014-09-13 12:12:49	qdata	yup
2014-09-13 12:13:10	 *	qdata experienced saud initial confusion :-)
2014-09-13 12:13:18	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: I also like Cinnamon but I REALLY like GNOME especially with all the extensions...so nice
2014-09-13 12:13:28	MichaelTunnell_	qdata: :) me too
2014-09-13 12:13:48	SomehowIForgot	How customizable is Gnome 3? I haven't actually used it that much, the only time was while trying out Antergos Live...
2014-09-13 12:13:52	SomehowIForgot	Which... was not for a lengthy period.
2014-09-13 12:14:33	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: there are so many things you can do and the best part is that most extensions dont effect each other so you can accomplish things that were not intended by installing multiple extensions in a pack for the purpose
2014-09-13 12:14:33	Noxbru	extensions+themes, and it ends being ok
2014-09-13 12:15:19	SomehowIForgot	Where can I find/ see said things, because it looked as if it lacked customization ability to the highest extent when I checked the almost empty settings menu.
2014-09-13 12:15:45	MichaelTunnell_	for example: I was looking for. I wanted the Message Tray to activate only when I told it to and not on mouse hover on the edge. Combining the "Insensitive Message Tray" extension with the "Hot Edges" extension gives me exactly what I wanted.
2014-09-13 12:15:57	MichaelTunnell_	http://extensions.gnome.org
2014-09-13 12:16:09	MichaelTunnell_	you dont need GNOME to explore the extensions either...just to use them :)
2014-09-13 12:16:23	SomehowIForgot	I'm positive I can find some of the configurations that are used to design the default Gnome 3 feel in Antergos, if I were to install it with something like OpenBox first, and then come back and install Gnome 3 from the terminal, by checking the source code provided on GitHub?
2014-09-13 12:16:56	MichaelTunnell_	GNOME is basically just GNOME in Antergos with Numix GTK Theme and Icons
2014-09-13 12:17:10	SomehowIForgot	Well that's easy!
2014-09-13 12:17:11	MichaelTunnell_	they also install nice fonts if you want them
2014-09-13 12:17:32	shndns	 yeah i used to use gnome for ever then i started using cinnamon after i ran mint for a few days
2014-09-13 12:17:53	shndns	but i always have a soft spot for gnome
2014-09-13 12:18:14	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: Cinnamon is nice and I like it for computers that cant run GNOME but ever since trying GNOME 3.12 I love it and the workflow is great for me though I can see where it could put some people off
2014-09-13 12:18:36	MichaelTunnell_	"traditional desktop" users will not like the GNOME workflow but I like innovation so I am all for it
2014-09-13 12:18:47	MichaelTunnell_	I even tried Unity for a year but such crap that is
2014-09-13 12:18:59	MichaelTunnell_	well not the whole thing...the Dash is a giant piece of crap
2014-09-13 12:19:02	shndns	a entire year?
2014-09-13 12:19:04	SomehowIForgot	So to everyone: What is your favorite DE/WM (OTHER THAN GNOME!) thus far, which you have actually tested? Why? And what is your opinion of: Openbox/ Awesome
2014-09-13 12:19:12	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: I test the hell out of stuff
2014-09-13 12:19:20	shndns	haha i hated unity
2014-09-13 12:19:29	shndns	shoulda just left it as gnome i think
2014-09-13 12:19:41	MichaelTunnell_	I dont like people giving an opinion of something if they dont use something for at least a week but sometimes I force myself the test like a crazy person
2014-09-13 12:20:05	shndns	lol well i guess thats the best way to do it
2014-09-13 12:20:19	SomehowIForgot	Sure, but that's okay. I see nothing wrong with that MichaelTunnell.
2014-09-13 12:20:19	shndns	i ran it on my laptop awhile back
2014-09-13 12:20:36	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: well when you have been in Linux for 15 years...testing something for a year doesnt seem that long as it does to others :)
2014-09-13 12:21:09	shndns	yeah im at about 10 years
2014-09-13 12:21:20	shndns	on and off
2014-09-13 12:21:44	SomehowIForgot	Sadly I only made the shift from Microshaft Wangblows, a few months ago. I started on Manjaro... For about two days exactly, but I was using Xfce and none of my hardware was working properly. Thus, I switched to Mint, I've been using that ever since. I've loved it, but grown tired of the bloaty, unappealing interface.
2014-09-13 12:21:52	<--	vecchp (~vecchp@108-70-154-63.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-09-13 12:22:50	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: I like Cinnamon if I dont use GNOME. After that...well I dont like any of them enough to compete with either even though I have used almost everything. Openbox is great for lightweight and older computers and Awesome is an accurate name for a Tiling manager...but with GNOME there is an extension called Shell Shape which allows you to have full tiling functions similar to Awesome or XMonad inside of GNOME
2014-09-13 12:22:51	MichaelTunnell_	and it is FANTASTIC!
2014-09-13 12:23:30	SomehowIForgot	Thanks for that informaton MichaelTunnell, that's actually quite exciting and now I feel compelled to look into it!
2014-09-13 12:23:35	shndns	mint is awesome id put it on anyones pc that has never used linux
2014-09-13 12:23:41	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: Cinnamon is not bloated. XFCE uses 70mb of RAM to run and Cinnamon uses 79mb so yea not bloated
2014-09-13 12:23:57	SomehowIForgot	I meant visually bloated, pardon my incorrect wordage.
2014-09-13 12:24:05	shndns	but i personally am not a fan of apt i tried and tried to like it but ehh
2014-09-13 12:24:35	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: I like Mint a lot and give it to pretty much everyone...except myself :)
2014-09-13 12:25:01	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: I dont think it is visually bloated either...feels very similar in most ways but alright.
2014-09-13 12:25:15	MichaelTunnell_	Openbox is certainly not bloated in any way :)
2014-09-13 12:25:23	shndns	openbox is awesome
2014-09-13 12:25:35	shndns	i was a long time user of fluxbox but it kinda seems to have died out
2014-09-13 12:26:02	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: apt is awesome but almost no one uses it correctly...it is meant to be a backend and even apt-get is meant to be as well but all of the frontends suck...like aptitude so people gave up and just used apt-get
2014-09-13 12:26:08	SomehowIForgot	So I didn't actually come here because of me. My friend screwed up.
2014-09-13 12:26:16	SomehowIForgot	He had Mint 16, and wanted to dual boot Antergos.
2014-09-13 12:26:27	shndns	i remember even using blackbox on my windows side
2014-09-13 12:26:34	SomehowIForgot	I thought he could genuinely do it by himself, so I let him. He managed to successfully partition and install so I was proud....
2014-09-13 12:27:05	SomehowIForgot	But.... Then he realized GRUB only showed Antergos and tried to fix that.... He clearly didn't get to the mkconfig command, and instead somehow screwed up his system. It doesn't recognize it as having any system installed.
2014-09-13 12:27:10	shndns	pacman is just so fast nothing compares
2014-09-13 12:27:20	SomehowIForgot	We tried many things, including reinstalling GRUB and Antergos.
2014-09-13 12:27:20	SomehowIForgot	.-.
2014-09-13 12:27:36	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: pacman is awesome certainly
2014-09-13 12:27:40	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: ouch
2014-09-13 12:28:07	shndns	chroot into that beast and fix it
2014-09-13 12:28:10	MichaelTunnell_	Antergos and Arch is known for teaching people about Linux the stuff they had no intention of learning. :) I love this about it but not everyone would.
2014-09-13 12:28:10	SomehowIForgot	I was hoping someone could help him....
2014-09-13 12:28:18	SomehowIForgot	I really can't, not with my current knowledge.
2014-09-13 12:28:40	shndns	boot live and google how to repair grub
2014-09-13 12:29:00	MichaelTunnell_	well there is the upgrate grub function from earlier but so much has changed like you said so it might not solve the issue at this point
2014-09-13 12:29:30	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: but yea you will need to boot live and then run the commands to update it that way you can do things without stuff mounted
2014-09-13 12:29:44	MichaelTunnell_	like shndns said*
2014-09-13 12:29:50	SomehowIForgot	I instructed him to join this chan, so maybe you can help him directly.
2014-09-13 12:29:59	SomehowIForgot	I actually have to be going right now, but only for a short while I hope.
2014-09-13 12:30:00	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: maybe
2014-09-13 12:30:07	shndns	you dont have to mount anything to repair grub?
2014-09-13 12:30:07	MichaelTunnell_	kk ciao
2014-09-13 12:30:17	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: you dont have to no
2014-09-13 12:30:27	SomehowIForgot	If you don't mind, I'll leave this open for now. But I won't exactly be here. Take care!
2014-09-13 12:30:40	shndns	how? i always just mounted everything and chrooted in
2014-09-13 12:30:42	MichaelTunnell_	you run the commands without it mounted to make sure they actually take
2014-09-13 12:31:13	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: it isn't a requirement but I typically do it that way...but that is the harder way to do it
2014-09-13 12:31:18	MichaelTunnell_	maybe I am a masochist
2014-09-13 12:31:36	shndns	wait doesnt archchroot or what ever it is do that?
2014-09-13 12:31:37	MichaelTunnell_	SomehowIForgot: we idle here pretty much
2014-09-13 12:32:05	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: do what
2014-09-13 12:32:20	MichaelTunnell_	slightly vague question
2014-09-13 12:33:13	shndns	haha sorry isnt archchroot (i dont remember the exact command) mount everything for you before chrooting?
2014-09-13 12:33:33	MichaelTunnell_	I just realized his likely problem....he probably had two MBRs...cant do that
2014-09-13 12:33:49	MichaelTunnell_	like Mint and Antergos both tried to have an MBR and thus breakage
2014-09-13 12:33:57	shndns	that happens?
2014-09-13 12:34:07	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: yep unless you dont tell it not to
2014-09-13 12:34:13	shndns	i thought it would automatically write over
2014-09-13 12:34:26	MichaelTunnell_	if you do the manual partitioning you can stop it but if you dont then well it happens
2014-09-13 12:34:43	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: if you are dualbooting no
2014-09-13 12:35:10	shndns	i always manually partition do you mean like making 2 boot partitions?
2014-09-13 12:35:21	shndns	bootable
2014-09-13 12:35:51	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: you can only make one bootable but automatic doesnt always remove the first boot so making a new boot will cause two attempts
2014-09-13 12:36:39	shndns	oh ive never done auto partition
2014-09-13 12:36:59	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: yea I stopped doing it a long time ago when it broke stuff :) now always manual
2014-09-13 12:37:11	MichaelTunnell_	unless it is a clean system for a friend or something
2014-09-13 12:37:19	shndns	i remember one time i accidentally made my drive gpt and i had to wipe everything
2014-09-13 12:37:40	MichaelTunnell_	oh sorry yea arch-chroot mounts some things but not everything...it mounts filesystem apis like /proc
2014-09-13 12:37:44	MichaelTunnell_	but doesnt mount everything

2014-09-13 12:38:10	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: I wonder who this is
2014-09-13 12:39:10	MichaelTunnell_	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2014-09-13 12:39:40	MichaelTunnell_	have you tried to do that to update your grub? FriendofSomehow because update-grub doesnt exist in anything outside of Debian family
2014-09-13 12:40:11	FriendofSomehow	Well the thing is I'm not even sure  I have grub in the right place
2014-09-13 12:40:45	FriendofSomehow	When I boot up It tells me device not found and then grub rescue>
2014-09-13 12:41:02	shndns	did you run grub-install /dev/sdX??
2014-09-13 12:41:14	FriendofSomehow	Yea, I did a moment ago
2014-09-13 12:41:26	shndns	ok then run the command he posted
2014-09-13 12:41:49	shndns	should make a prompt of antergos and what ever other systems that are installed
2014-09-13 12:42:38	FriendofSomehow	Okay, I shoud run thaat in terminal of the live antergo I'm in, yeah?
2014-09-13 12:45:10	FriendofSomehow	Returns: /dev/cdrom: openfailed:no medium found | No volume groups found
2014-09-13 12:45:30	shndns	your not chrooted in your system?
2014-09-13 12:46:12	FriendofSomehow	The system I'm running is a live antergos from my usb
2014-09-13 12:46:28	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: yea like shndns you need to get into the system you want to edit otherwise you would be modifying the live environment
2014-09-13 12:46:43	shndns	ok well do you know what partition your /boot is?
2014-09-13 12:46:54	FriendofSomehow	Right, and my problem is I cant get into either of my systems
2014-09-13 12:47:02	FriendofSomehow	Because grub is acting up
2014-09-13 12:47:10	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: not the only way to do it
2014-09-13 12:47:18	FriendofSomehow	Okay.
2014-09-13 12:47:27	shndns	FriendofSomehow do you know what partition your /boot is on?
2014-09-13 12:47:45	shndns	or maybe just you /
2014-09-13 12:48:15	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: did you make a separate /boot partition or no? (relevant to shndns question)
2014-09-13 12:48:29	FriendofSomehow	I would thing there would be a /boot on either system but I cannot recall
2014-09-13 12:48:57	shndns	what is your root parition? /dev/sdaX
2014-09-13 12:48:58	FriendofSomehow	when I installed antergos, my second system, I installed it on /.
2014-09-13 12:49:21	FriendofSomehow	one of the options was /boot if that says anything
2014-09-13 12:49:28	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: "/" applies to only root so not a partition
2014-09-13 12:49:58	MichaelTunnell_	/dev/sda1 or some other number is the partition ide
2014-09-13 12:49:59	MichaelTunnell_	id
2014-09-13 12:50:23	shndns	FriendofSomehow open gparted i think it might tell you in there?
2014-09-13 12:50:29	FriendofSomehow	Mhm. My partitions are named /dev/sda1 and /sda2
2014-09-13 12:50:34	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: it should yes
2014-09-13 12:50:52	shndns	so which one is / installed too
2014-09-13 12:50:58	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: that is expected but we need to know which you installed root to
2014-09-13 12:51:14	FriendofSomehow	Gparted is loading, lemme see

2014-09-13 12:51:55	MichaelTunnell_	I guess we should figure out which he wants to be the main system
2014-09-13 12:51:58	shndns	well if he only has 2 partitions then ones / and ones swap so im guessing its /dev/sda1
2014-09-13 12:52:23	FriendofSomehow	Hang on a sec more jsut got returned from the grub command you had me enter
2014-09-13 12:52:26	MichaelTunnell_	if he was trying to build a dual boot system then he should have multiple parititons
2014-09-13 12:52:30	FriendofSomehow	It found my systems
2014-09-13 12:52:44	shndns	ok which has the mount point of "/"
2014-09-13 12:53:31	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: screw this lol
2014-09-13 12:53:41	FriendofSomehow	I know both my Antergos's do, how do I check if my mint does?
2014-09-13 12:53:43	MichaelTunnell_	FriendofSomehow: screenshot the gparted listings and imgur it
2014-09-13 12:53:53	shndns	i dont understand

2014-09-13 12:54:38	MichaelTunnell_	and the live antergos has gnome-screenshot built in I think so should be good to go
2014-09-13 12:54:49	shndns	yeah it will hopefully but he said he only had sda1 and 2 where would mint be

2014-09-13 13:18:39	FriendofSomehow	I think so. I"m in antergo now the one  I have installed, I'll try mint now
2014-09-13 13:18:57	shndns	if it shows up you shouldnt have a issue booting unless you messed your mint install

2014-09-13 14:16:52	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: why?
2014-09-13 14:17:10	MichaelTunnell_	just curious
2014-09-13 14:17:12	Noxbru	don't know... I guess that because you know more than most
2014-09-13 14:17:14	shndns	its the same as arch just with a graphical installer but ive used arch for awhile
2014-09-13 14:18:27	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: that is what I thought you might think :) just clarifying
2014-09-13 14:18:42	Noxbru	haha, I'm that predictable? :)
2014-09-13 14:19:03	MichaelTunnell_	I used to use arch years ago and when my system borked I didnt feel like redoing everything so I was lazy and didnt go back...then Antergos came and made the transition back so easy that I jumped on it
2014-09-13 14:19:08	Noxbru	how much time do you think I have using Antergos? just curiosity ;)
2014-09-13 14:19:27	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: only in this once instance :)
2014-09-13 14:19:48	MichaelTunnell_	well based on perspective that I have I would say 6 months
2014-09-13 14:20:06	Noxbru	more, more :) according to my pacman logs for a year
2014-09-13 14:20:22	MichaelTunnell_	nice
2014-09-13 14:20:35	MichaelTunnell_	early adopter then I see
2014-09-13 14:21:08	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: yea I expected you were an arch guy when you said one day lol...no other way you could know that stuff unless you already had the experience elsewhere
2014-09-13 14:23:00	Noxbru	not really, I first knew the project when it was cinnarch, and I wanted to try it, but one of my rules (DO NOT do big changes with your system in the middle of the scholar year) prevented me to change, then it changed its name to Antergos
2014-09-13 14:23:28	Noxbru	after that, last June I installed Antergos
2014-09-13 14:23:43	MichaelTunnell_	well it changed more than just the name but yea :)
2014-09-13 14:24:07	shndns	ive actually only used arch for a little bit
2014-09-13 14:24:12	shndns	i used manjaro for a long time though
2014-09-13 14:24:40	MichaelTunnell_	I was not interested when it was CinnArch but when it became Antergos and changed the goal for the distro I was excited but I had a crappy system not worth bothering with so I didn't but then I made my new computer and seemed perfect timing
2014-09-13 14:24:43	shndns	why i found antergos was looking at other distros that used pacman
2014-09-13 14:24:49	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: manjaro ewww
2014-09-13 14:24:50	MichaelTunnell_	lol
2014-09-13 14:25:11	shndns	i never had any issues with manjaro
2014-09-13 14:25:31	Noxbru	I have never tried manjaro
2014-09-13 14:25:38	shndns	the community was a lot friendlier than most though
2014-09-13 14:26:10	dmnmsc	I used Manjaro... XFCE was really good
2014-09-13 14:26:10	Noxbru	when I changed to Antergos I was using Fedora 17, in fact, I think it was just about the end of support of that release
2014-09-13 14:26:59	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: I hate manjaro because they are not honest with their users and claim that the AUR and Arch is compatible with their system but it isnt
2014-09-13 14:27:35	MichaelTunnell_	they also give people access to the AUR without ever warning them of the problem of using it
2014-09-13 14:27:51	shndns	i never had any issues with aur in manjaro
2014-09-13 14:27:54	MichaelTunnell_	and the biggest sin is giving them access to the AUR with no chance of support ever
2014-09-13 14:28:16	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: whether you had issues or not is not relevant because many do and have no support method at all
2014-09-13 14:28:39	MichaelTunnell_	Manjaro does not support anything in the AUR but the AUR maintainers can't support Manjaro because it is not Arch and they dont use Manjaro
2014-09-13 14:28:46	MichaelTunnell_	thus ZERO support
2014-09-13 14:29:55	Noxbru	well... In Antergos you can install yaourt from Antergos' repos and just use it blindly without knowing a lot about the AUR
2014-09-13 14:30:02	shndns	well just gotta be smart about it
2014-09-13 14:30:19	MichaelTunnell_	Noxbru: yes but Antergos warns you about it Manjaro does not
2014-09-13 14:30:31	shndns	manjaro warns you about using the aur
2014-09-13 14:30:38	MichaelTunnell_	only when you are using it
2014-09-13 14:30:41	shndns	yaourt does before installing doesnt it?
2014-09-13 14:30:49	MichaelTunnell_	Antergos does not give you access to it without warning in the first place
2014-09-13 14:30:59	shndns	ohhhh i know what you mean
2014-09-13 14:31:01	shndns	in the installer
2014-09-13 14:31:29	MichaelTunnell_	in Cnchi you have to choose access to the AUR it doesnt just give it to you...then it warns you
2014-09-13 14:32:04	MichaelTunnell_	Manjaro doesnt do that and just gives it to you with no warning until you try to use it and then it gives on line that only warns that there will be no support but not warning about the AUR itself
2014-09-13 14:32:07	shndns	yeah i never went into it not knowing what it was so i never though twice
2014-09-13 14:32:35	MichaelTunnell_	Manjaro tries to be to Arch what Ubuntu is to Debian and I think that is a horrible thing to do in the first place
2014-09-13 14:32:45	MichaelTunnell_	Arch is not for regular users
2014-09-13 14:32:56	MichaelTunnell_	Manjaro tries to make it for them and that is NUTS
2014-09-13 14:33:15	shndns	i think its good arch is the new debian
2014-09-13 14:33:22	MichaelTunnell_	Antergos makes it easier but does provide warnings throughout so you know what you are getting into
2014-09-13 14:33:39	shndns	let people base there distros on it manjaro has there own stable repos so you dont run into many problems like you could with arch
2014-09-13 14:33:56	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: the repos are not stable they are bullshit
2014-09-13 14:34:15	shndns	running the stable repo when i first installed for about a month i never had any issues
2014-09-13 14:34:28	MichaelTunnell_	they hold packages back for two weeks but they test NOTHING...they do NOTHING and if something breaks with a package they blame Arch and Arch devs
2014-09-13 14:34:49	shndns	lol someones just a hater
2014-09-13 14:34:54	MichaelTunnell_	they even change credit to themselves on packages they have nothing to do with
2014-09-13 14:35:00	MichaelTunnell_	I hate the project because they deserve hate
2014-09-13 14:35:06	shndns	manjaro is still early on its not even to 1 yet
2014-09-13 14:35:07	MichaelTunnell_	they are liars and dont care about the users
2014-09-13 14:35:34	shndns	well what is in it for them then?
2014-09-13 14:36:00	MichaelTunnell_	first release of Manjaro was 2012-08-20 so no idea what you are referencing
2014-09-13 14:36:04	shndns	mhwd is awesome and the fact you can have multiple kernels installed for testing is another plus
2014-09-13 14:36:17	shndns	yeah but they dont have a official release

2014-09-13 14:40:15	MichaelTunnell_	they try to be almost as rolling and bleeding edge as arch and that is dangerous for regular users

2014-09-13 14:42:15	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: completely agree
2014-09-13 14:42:18	MichaelTunnell_	they claim they are rolling and they claim they are stable but they do absolutely NOTHING to the packages...they just hold them back for Arch users to test them
2014-09-13 14:42:31	shndns	so
2014-09-13 14:42:35	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: exactly which is against everything arch stands for
2014-09-13 14:42:37	shndns	lol that means it works
2014-09-13 14:42:39	MichaelTunnell_	I have talked to TUs and they all say "how is it more stable...it has not changed"
2014-09-13 14:43:00	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: that means they are assholes
2014-09-13 14:43:11	jaco60	(btw... if Arch keep the new packages a little longer in testing, that would be cool, sometimes)
2014-09-13 14:43:15	shndns	out of all the people using arch if there was a issue it would come up before 2 weeks
2014-09-13 14:43:20	arch3y	arch has a testing channel that all of the devs use and maintain everything before it gest pushed
2014-09-13 14:43:28	MichaelTunnell_	if they admit they dont do shit then fine but they claim that they have their own repo and that it is more stable when they change NOTHING and do NOTHING
2014-09-13 14:43:47	MichaelTunnell_	yet they also take credit from other people and even change the credit in the files themselves
2014-09-13 14:43:51	arch3y	most of the other dervies pulll stuff from arches repo anyways which arch does not like
2014-09-13 14:43:51	vecchp	lol the anger
2014-09-13 14:44:01	MichaelTunnell_	jaco60: that defeats the point really
2014-09-13 14:44:02	shndns	well they also have a testing repo
2014-09-13 14:44:03	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: yeah that makes everyone super pissed off
2014-09-13 14:44:30	shndns	lol that should be a channel rule dont bring up manjaro
2014-09-13 14:44:39	shndns	as bad as politics lol
2014-09-13 14:45:12	dmnmsc	they also stolen the Chakra work... removing the credits.

2014-09-13 14:45:28	shndns	imagine how debian people felt when ubuntu came around
2014-09-13 14:45:35	dmnmsc	Looking at the code you could see Chakra's devs with manjaro mails... and they never worked for manjaro
2014-09-13 14:45:43	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: they didnt take credit from Debian they even praise Debian for their work
2014-09-13 14:46:00	shndns	yeah but manjaro has done things for them selves as well
2014-09-13 14:46:17	vecchp	well from what I've heard manjaro doesn't even have a real vision
2014-09-13 14:46:19	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: so what...if you steal you are a thief...it doesnt matter if you make something else too
2014-09-13 14:46:56	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: hell that fool Muller said that Arch will not longer be the based of Manjaro in two years and it will be a Windows & Mac hybrid
2014-09-13 14:47:07	dmnmsc	if they just said "this is a Chakra wok"... but they even changed the mails.....
2014-09-13 14:47:40	MichaelTunnell_	dmnmsc: exactly they pretend they do shit they never do and they claim they do work others do and that is blasphemy in Open Source
2014-09-13 14:47:41	vecchp	MichaelTunnell_, does he plan on raiding Apple and Microsoft's headquarters for the source code?
2014-09-13 14:47:51	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: I heard that as well they obvs just want to profit off the works of others
2014-09-13 14:48:00	shndns	lol i dont listen to all the hype like you guys
2014-09-13 14:48:00	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: no one knows what the hell he meant
2014-09-13 14:48:23	jaco60	Manjaro kernels are Ubuntu kernels, isn't it ?
2014-09-13 14:48:24	shndns	do you have proof of all this that you can physically verify your self
2014-09-13 14:48:35	vecchp	MichaelTunnell_, I seeeeeee
2014-09-13 14:48:50	shndns	manjaro kernels are arch kerneles with only a couple tweaks from what ive read
2014-09-13 14:49:02	MichaelTunnell_	longer reasoning for why I hate Manjaro http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/24bdh8/what_does_rlinux_think_of_manjaro/ch5tuot and in that I explain the stupid windows mac thing
2014-09-13 14:49:03	arch3y	are any of the antergos devs in here btw
2014-09-13 14:49:28	shndns	think about how many arch fanboys there are though...
2014-09-13 14:49:32	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: the credit yes pick a random package they dont explicitly claim as their own
2014-09-13 14:49:35	shndns	like diehards
2014-09-13 14:49:40	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: as for the stupid windows mac thing the link above
2014-09-13 14:49:51	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: pretty much no
2014-09-13 14:49:58	MichaelTunnell_	best place for them is G+ community
2014-09-13 14:50:13	arch3y	yes bu there are also a ton fo ppl who get on the hype of arch and use stuff like manjaro casue its easy
2014-09-13 14:50:16	vecchp	shndns, I actually have never come across a diehard for any distro.  Only people from other dirtros making fun of these supposed diehards.
2014-09-13 14:50:22	arch3y	when they shouldnt use arch in the first place
2014-09-13 14:50:27	MichaelTunnell_	arch fanboys are annoying sure but fanboys for anything is annoying
2014-09-13 14:50:47	vecchp	shndns, you to arch and they make fun of gentoo people.
2014-09-13 14:51:01	vecchp	you go to gentoo and they make fun or arch/ubuntu people
2014-09-13 14:51:02	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: no offense but JB kind of helps some of that along some of the ppl in the channel now use this and manjaro and really shouldnt
2014-09-13 14:51:06	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: gentoo people make fun of gentoo people :)
2014-09-13 14:51:14	arch3y	gentooricers
2014-09-13 14:51:25	shndns	lol gentoo people are just as bad
2014-09-13 14:51:28	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: no offense taken totally agree...they gobble on Arch's balls all the time
2014-09-13 14:51:55	arch3y	and MichaelTunnell_ thanks Ill see if they response to my email if not Ill hit up g+
2014-09-13 14:52:04	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: aight welcome
2014-09-13 14:52:17	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: yeah its ok aslong as they take the time to read the wiki and such but they dont want to
2014-09-13 14:52:24	MichaelTunnell_	I wish JB wouldnt talk about Arch so much...just so asburd
2014-09-13 14:52:30	vecchp	shndns, I think is is just some people in .  They pick something and then feel like their distro is now a "part of them" so they have to defend their choice.
2014-09-13 14:52:35	arch3y	if its not on the arch wiki or gentoowiki it doesnt exist
2014-09-13 14:52:46	shndns	linux is linux thats how i see it
2014-09-13 14:52:57	shndns	distros just include features
2014-09-13 14:52:58	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: lol not true I had to add something to the Arch wiki because it wasnt there when I solved my own problem
2014-09-13 14:53:04	MichaelTunnell_	so there are cracks :)
2014-09-13 14:53:11	arch3y	its a great distro just not for everyone in JB as most of them are so new to linux that they still run m$ as their main os
2014-09-13 14:53:28	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: lol true but you also helped to make it better as well
2014-09-13 14:53:43	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: linux is just a kernel technically so no linux is not linux otherwise Android would be included in every Linux conversation. :)
2014-09-13 14:53:43	shndns	when i first got into linux i never saw arch as being one of the top distros
2014-09-13 14:53:50	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: true
2014-09-13 14:53:58	arch3y	I dont think its meant to be a top distro
2014-09-13 14:54:09	arch3y	its meant to be a distro for a certain type of user
2014-09-13 14:54:17	vecchp	Actually i think rolling release distros are the future of linux and most OS's
2014-09-13 14:54:26	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: exactly
2014-09-13 14:54:35	arch3y	if I have to reinstall my os to get the latest stuff thats a pita
2014-09-13 14:54:38	MichaelTunnell_	vecchp: I disagree...not everyone can handle that
2014-09-13 14:54:42	MichaelTunnell_	semi-rolling maybe
2014-09-13 14:54:45	arch3y	but if I can just update its makes alot better
2014-09-13 14:54:54	shndns	im not talking about it like that though i mean it runs on the linux kernel it runs all the same apps as other distros some distros just have specific features and that is all
2014-09-13 14:55:00	MichaelTunnell_	SolydXK style rolling then maybe but they even abandoned their own style
2014-09-13 14:55:40	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: Android runs on the Linux kernel so no that though process does not work
2014-09-13 14:55:52	vecchp	MichaelTunnell_, yah maybe semi-rolling
2014-09-13 14:56:05	shndns	android may use the linux kernel but its not normally classified as linux
2014-09-13 14:56:06	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: love your comments on that reddit link you posted
2014-09-13 14:56:08	jaco60	or rolling release with snapshots...
2014-09-13 14:56:20	shndns	thats like calling playstations bsd boxes
2014-09-13 14:56:20	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: if only ppl would see what it takes to maintain 5500 pkgs
2014-09-13 14:56:22	jaco60	to be able to roll back, just in case
2014-09-13 14:56:25	MichaelTunnell_	for those that dont know SolydXK used to have a 3 month update pack for semi-rolling which was interesting concept but then they abandoned it completely and now just totally suck
2014-09-13 14:56:46	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: :) thanks more than that many
2014-09-13 14:56:54	MichaelTunnell_	absurd those asses claim what they claim
2014-09-13 14:56:59	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: I meant my own repo lol
2014-09-13 14:57:07	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: well damn lol
2014-09-13 14:57:13	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: but we are probably going to hit arches levels soon lol
2014-09-13 14:57:17	shndns	manjaro releases update packs....
2014-09-13 14:57:29	arch3y	its about 822 pkgs then all of the deps its 5500 or so
2014-09-13 14:57:33	arch3y	between two ppl
2014-09-13 14:57:52	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: they are shit in so many ways...one concept is not going to save them lol
2014-09-13 14:58:09	shndns	im just sayin
2014-09-13 14:58:17	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: what is your system again?
2014-09-13 14:58:18	arch3y	btw why are fighting about manjaro in an antergos channel lol
2014-09-13 14:58:23	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: archassault.org
2014-09-13 14:58:37	MichaelTunnell_	damn it how do I forget that every time
2014-09-13 14:58:41	shndns	i said i used manjaro and buddy over here got heated
2014-09-13 14:58:50	vecchp	WHAT
2014-09-13 14:58:50	MichaelTunnell_	especially considering ArchAssault is Awesome lol

2014-09-13 15:00:52	arch3y	as we use the standard pacstrap to install alot of ppl dont like that
2014-09-13 15:01:04	MichaelTunnell_	OH I get it
2014-09-13 15:01:06	arch3y	so it limits certain ppl from using us but we arent going to bend our ways

2014-09-13 15:01:25	MichaelTunnell_	I like it
2014-09-13 15:01:26	shndns	whats the main difference between archbang and this?
2014-09-13 15:01:38	arch3y	plus being a layer we can technically be added to any pacman based distro
2014-09-13 15:01:50	MichaelTunnell_	shndns: HOW DARE YOU!!! HOW DARE YOU BRING UP ARCHBANG!

2014-09-13 15:02:49	MichaelTunnell_	arch3y: so if it can be installed via pacman what is the problem?
2014-09-13 15:02:59	arch3y	well I MichaelTunnell_ its not problem
2014-09-13 15:03:01	MichaelTunnell_	is it like adding mirrorlists or something
2014-09-13 15:03:13	arch3y	MichaelTunnell_: well mirrorlists and our keyring
2014-09-13 15:03:24	arch3y	plus if we get support from the other derives it just helps us out more
2014-09-13 15:03:45	MichaelTunnell_	oh ok cool cool
2014-09-13 15:03:52	arch3y	and archbang is basically a themed version of arch running openbox and its all configured to work out of the box

2014-09-13 15:16:52	shndns	plasma 5 is nice
2014-09-13 15:16:52	dmnmsc_	vecchp: I said is/was because I changed my laptop and I don't have msata port. Antergos was installed on my msata drive
2014-09-13 15:17:28	shndns	but ever since i first started i always picked gnome of kde
2014-09-13 15:17:52	shndns	kde used to give off a more of a windows feel and thats what i was trying to get away from in the beginning
2014-09-13 15:18:09	vecchp	kde just never felt clean to me
2014-09-13 15:18:16	vecchp	at least the defaults
2014-09-13 15:18:34	dmnmsc_	kde is the most configurable DE

2014-09-13 23:03:34	Aethysius	You think xfce's terrible, MichaelTunnell?
2014-09-13 23:04:32	gooberfoob	I have used xfce in the past, I am using cinnamon and it is my first time really using it, and it doe seem to be more of a resource hog

2014-09-13 23:04:50	MichaelTunnell	gooberfoob: based on what
2014-09-13 23:05:09	MichaelTunnell	XFCE uses 70mb of RAM to run and Cinnamon uses 79mb

2014-09-13 23:06:20	Aethysius	^
2014-09-13 23:06:35	gooberfoob	I will give that a try, because empathy is just lagg central.
2014-09-13 23:06:43	MichaelTunnell	pidgin has way too many features that empathy doesnt which makes it hard to bother with empathy

2014-09-14 11:23:46	qdata	opalepatrick: since Antergos is using Arch repos and only one additional one of it's own, the Arch wiki applies. Some background reading here:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Package_management

2014-09-14 11:24:24	qdata	as well as man pacman, but essentially the short answer is imply the pacman -Syu command
2014-09-14 11:24:57	qdata	however, you should familiarize yourself before just following commands you don't what they do
2014-09-14 11:25:12	qdata	either sudo or as root
2014-09-14 11:26:19	opalepatrick	thanks qdata - I familiar with updating via terminla with ubuntu. Just saw references to antergos updates and wondered.
2014-09-14 11:26:30	qdata	me I hesitate to blindly update without a fall back plan - I boot to a parted magic CD and use Clonezilla to make a backup image before I run an update so I always can fall back to a know good if somehow an update b0rks my system
2014-09-14 11:26:49	opalepatrick	oh that is a good idea
2014-09-14 11:27:27	opalepatrick	need to check out clonezilla
2014-09-14 11:27:35	qdata	there is an Antergos wiki but it is in it's infancy and the Arch wiki contains lots more info and detail that applies to Antergos as well

2014-09-14 22:10:12	MichaelTunnell	i just want to know if it gives 1080p option
2014-09-14 22:10:43	MichaelTunnell	sorry...I am trying to fix a xbox 360 red ring and these things are such a pain in the ass
2014-09-14 22:10:58	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, i've heard of the red ring of death
2014-09-14 22:11:50	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, yes it shows the 1080p option.  Did it not for others?
2014-09-14 22:12:12	MichaelTunnell	it doesnt for html5
2014-09-14 22:12:18	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, yes it does
2014-09-14 22:12:21	MichaelTunnell	try it in html5 now and it will max at 720p
2014-09-14 22:12:49	MichaelTunnell	I was wondering if it was only me or is this an actual bullshit limitation that youtube set
2014-09-14 22:13:09	MichaelTunnell	next I am going to test xbmc and see if it gives 1080p for that too
2014-09-14 22:13:10	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, probably a bandwidth problem on your end
2014-09-14 22:13:30	MichaelTunnell	lol no it certainly isnt a bandwidth problem
2014-09-14 22:13:44	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, well either way flash and html5 get 1080p
2014-09-14 22:13:57	MichaelTunnell	that makes no sense at all
2014-09-14 22:14:13	MichaelTunnell	how many megbits do you have down

2014-09-14 22:14:39	vecchp	probably not as much as you but 10-15
2014-09-14 22:15:13	MichaelTunnell	not as much as me? how could it be a speed issue when I have at least twice as much as you yet you get it at 1080p
2014-09-14 22:15:16	MichaelTunnell	not sense at all
2014-09-14 22:15:38	MichaelTunnell	damn you youtube for making stuff so obscure
2014-09-14 22:15:42	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, could be the network path to you not necessarily your total possible bandwidth
2014-09-14 22:16:04	MichaelTunnell	using google dns so it should take the most direct path possible
2014-09-14 22:16:29	vecchp	vecchp, pretty sure that the routing of your network provider overrides that
2014-09-14 22:16:33	MichaelTunnell	i might try changing dns again to see what happens
2014-09-14 22:16:41	vecchp	why did i just talk to myself
2014-09-14 22:16:52	MichaelTunnell	my network provider is by law not allowed to do that
2014-09-14 22:17:21	MichaelTunnell	if I set dns manually in my router it is illegal for them to change my dns back to theirs or to overwrite it
2014-09-14 22:17:37	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, i'm not saying they overwrite your dns settings
2014-09-14 22:17:38	MichaelTunnell	plus they have zero incentive to do that
2014-09-14 22:17:48	MichaelTunnell	dns controls the path the network takes
2014-09-14 22:17:59	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, that isn't always true
2014-09-14 22:18:26	MichaelTunnell	that is the norm
2014-09-14 22:18:58	MichaelTunnell	regardless of always...is the sky always blue? well not at night time or sunrise or sunset
2014-09-14 22:19:07	MichaelTunnell	or at all technically since it has no colors
2014-09-14 22:19:14	MichaelTunnell	lol nevermind I am babbling
2014-09-14 22:19:36	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, it's pretty common for network providers to send traffic through hops that are not the shortest.  Thats why games like league of legends always end up having trouble since providers sometimes route the massive traffic they have through different paths
2014-09-14 22:20:21	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: I know all of that...the issue is the network provider is not in control of that hopping at all
2014-09-14 22:20:37	vecchp	MichaelTunnell, ok well hopefully you can figure out what the deal is
2014-09-14 22:20:48	MichaelTunnell	i dont care that much
2014-09-14 22:20:55	MichaelTunnell	but might try to fix it later
2014-09-14 22:21:13	MichaelTunnell	only been 11 months since my xbox broke that I decided to now fix it...so eventually I might

2014-09-15 10:01:10	alisonwonder	Hi everyone ! New Antergos and Arch user here !
2014-09-15 10:01:38	alisonwonder	I need help with a small bug in Antergos, couls someone please help me >?
2014-09-15 10:03:05	alisonwonder	I'm trying to launch Gnome Terminal via a shortcut:"Alt+z" but it takes about 30 seconds before the new terminal appears.
2014-09-15 10:05:05	sinix	how fast does it respond to pressing the super button?
2014-09-15 10:05:52	alisonwonder	Super button is fine(less than a second) but it's just the shortcut.
2014-09-15 10:06:14	alisonwonder	shortcut for terminal.
2014-09-15 10:06:37	sinix	then idk... I didn't realize that was a shortcut

2014-09-15 10:07:01	sinix	I'm running gnome and it's definitely not doing anything when i do alt-z
2014-09-15 10:08:14	alisonwonder	No, no, you hit super and type shortcut, Gnome launches the keyboard configuration application. You then configure the shortcuts there.

2014-09-15 10:11:13	sinix	hm, yeah, that's crazy slow
2014-09-15 10:11:26	sinix	wait, no, just the first time
2014-09-15 10:11:34	sinix	the second, third, etc times, it's instant
2014-09-15 10:11:55	alisonwonder	so it's okay for you ?
2014-09-15 10:12:24	sinix	yeah, the first time i hit it after i set the hotkey, basically everything froze up for 20-30 seconds
2014-09-15 10:12:39	sinix	but every time after, it's been instant
2014-09-15 10:12:49	alisonwonder	hmmm......
2014-09-15 10:13:12	sinix	this IRC is pretty quiet, maybe try the gnome room?
2014-09-15 10:13:54	alisonwonder	what's the #name ?
2014-09-15 10:15:13	sinix	 #gnome
2014-09-15 10:15:25	alisonwonder	LOL, okay thanks
2014-09-15 10:15:27	sinix	i think the official one is on gnome servers, but there's one here

2014-09-17 07:18:51	arshavin	freecaster: hi there
2014-09-17 07:19:26	freecaster	arshavin, I have now nvidia nonfree, and it seems to have problems with booting anymore :)
2014-09-17 07:19:29	arshavin	arshavin: did it work?
2014-09-17 07:19:33	freecaster	*to have no problems
2014-09-17 07:19:41	freecaster	yes, it worked
2014-09-17 07:19:50	freecaster	I am happy now :)
2014-09-17 07:20:00	arshavin	freecaster: great,nouveau may be buggy for some older cards
2014-09-17 07:20:02	freecaster	arshavin, why do you have nvidia notebook?
2014-09-17 07:20:24	arshavin	freecaster: Well,It was the cheapest one
2014-09-17 07:20:33	arshavin	freecaster: lol,that's true
2014-09-17 07:21:41	arshavin	freecaster: I play football games sometimes,so I needed one with dedicated gpu,and ironically it was the cheapest though with less hard drive storage,only 320GB
2014-09-17 07:23:10	arshavin	freecaster: nouveau works fine for me,but being able to play random games is what makes nvidia nonfree a choice
2014-09-17 07:23:28	freecaster	ok :)
2014-09-17 07:23:36	freecaster	arshavin, do you have thinkpad?
2014-09-17 07:23:56	arshavin	freecaster: no,Sony Vaio
2014-09-17 07:24:48	freecaster	:O
2014-09-17 07:25:22	freecaster	arshavin, I thought you have thinkpad :)
2014-09-17 07:25:28	arshavin	freecaster: now that you have the driver,you will have to reompile or reinstall the driver every time you update your kernel,or you can simply install the latest driver from arch repository,now that you know that it works
2014-09-17 07:25:45	freecaster	I will buy an thinkpad in the next months :)
2014-09-17 07:26:12	arshavin	freecaster: Lenovo
2014-09-17 07:26:13	freecaster	oh shit, I thought it will be compiled automatically :O
2014-09-17 07:26:27	freecaster	arshavin, yes, thinkpad trademark belongs to lenovo
2014-09-17 07:26:33	arshavin	freecaster: for that you need dkms
2014-09-17 07:27:19	arshavin	freecaster: there is an article on antergos website,on how to set up dkms for automatic update
2014-09-17 07:29:01	freecaster	ok
2014-09-17 07:32:14	freecaster	arshavin, got a problem: http://pastebin.com/yXs95nZu
2014-09-17 07:40:36	arshavin	freecaster: well nvidia-utils was installed earlier from binary
2014-09-17 07:42:14	arshavin	freecaster: freecaster this is what you need http://wiki.antergos.com/nvidia#Setting_up_drivers_for_Kernel_updates_via_Terminal
2014-09-17 07:43:20	arshavin	freecaster: have you got AUR installed,I mean can you use yaourt?
2014-09-17 07:45:26	arshavin	freecaster: to find dependency of a package,you can simply do pacman -Si nvidia
2014-09-17 07:45:37	freecaster	arshavin, sorry, was at the kitchen :D
2014-09-17 07:45:56	arshavin	freecaster: :)
2014-09-17 07:46:13	arshavin	freecaster: u just need to foloow this http://wiki.antergos.com/nvidia#Setting_up_drivers_for_Kernel_updates_via_Terminal
2014-09-17 07:46:30	freecaster	yes, I have installed it via yaourt...
2014-09-17 07:47:10	arshavin	freecaster: just this section Setting up drivers for Kernel updates via Terminal
2014-09-17 07:47:16	freecaster	:)
2014-09-17 07:49:39	freecaster	grr, I got the same error by the step of number 7 in the instruction
2014-09-17 07:50:41	arshavin	freecaster: I had not done it myself,so now I see, nvidia-dkms has nvidia-utils as dependency
2014-09-17 07:51:23	freecaster	ok, what should I do? Remove something?
2014-09-17 07:51:47	arshavin	freecaster: No
2014-09-17 07:51:51	freecaster	hmm
2014-09-17 07:52:31	arshavin	freecaster: if you remove,you will have to uninstall the binary and reinstall from arch repo
2014-09-17 07:52:37	freecaster	ok
2014-09-17 07:52:58	freecaster	but I don't want to remove the driver from yesterday :D
2014-09-17 07:53:51	arshavin	freecaster: yeah,it is not a big deal,you can reinstall,but I will look for some way of doing it conviniently
2014-09-17 07:54:19	freecaster	ok, I will wait, are you online in 1 hour? I have to visit sport lesson again :)
2014-09-17 07:54:29	arshavin	freecaster: yes of course
2014-09-17 07:55:18	freecaster	arshavin, thank you again for your helpfulness!
2014-09-17 07:56:42	freecaster	arshavin, see you :)

2014-09-18 03:56:56	khairulalim	hello, i'm ubuntu user. i want to change to arch linux, but i don't know what the diferent arch linux and antergos?
2014-09-18 03:58:13	freecaster	Can somebody help me setting up the kernels for nvidia? :)
2014-09-18 03:59:00	freecaster	khairulalim, antergos is easiser to install, and you can setup before the installation some useful packages like flashplugin,libreoffice or printer drivers :)
2014-09-18 03:59:53	freecaster	khairulalim, and you're always on the bleeding edge way, you have always newest stable packages with antergos ;-)
2014-09-18 03:59:53	freecaster	because antergos uses arch repos
2014-09-18 04:01:13	Noxbru	freecaster: not bleeding edge, stable, bleeding edge would be to have everything from git/svn ;)
2014-09-18 04:01:25	freecaster	Noxbru, hi there :)
2014-09-18 04:01:36	Noxbru	hi :)
2014-09-18 04:01:37	freecaster	and Noxbru thank you for correction
2014-09-18 04:02:23	Noxbru	nah, it's just that there's a difference, bleeding edge comes with all kind of nasty bugs and problems XD
2014-09-18 04:02:40	freecaster	Noxbru, bah! problems, I don't want to have them :D
2014-09-18 04:02:49	khairulalim	i read if we want to install new software, it's to hard, not same with ubuntu that we can install software with GUI? is it right?
2014-09-18 04:03:15	khairulalim	so where i can find the instruction to get new software, when i need to install new software
2014-09-18 04:03:22	Noxbru	anyway, khairulalim, I don't know what the latest ISO has, but Antergos comes with an installer that makes the installation MUCH MORE easy than Arch (graphical interface vs command line) ;)
2014-09-18 04:03:54	freecaster	khairulalim, antergos have a gui installer for system and pacmanxg for gui-installing for programs
2014-09-18 04:04:29	freecaster	khairulalim, don't worry, we will help you; have a look here: http://wiki.antergos.com/tiki-index.php?page=Installing%20Antergos
2014-09-18 04:05:02	freecaster	Noxbru, could you help me with nvidia kernel-module? :)
2014-09-18 04:05:34	Noxbru	freecaster: maybe, I don't know anything about it so...
2014-09-18 04:06:23	Noxbru	freecaster: Arch's wiki to the rescue! https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nvidia#Installing
2014-09-18 04:06:24	khairulalim	oh, so, i can install software without open terminal again? because, i't to hard when i get error when install new software. oke thank you. i'm downloading antergos now :D
2014-09-18 04:06:49	freecaster	khairulalim, pacman commands are not so hard to learn ;)
2014-09-18 04:07:04	freecaster	google for pacman rosetta stone khairulalim
2014-09-18 04:07:38	khairulalim	what is it? pacman command?
2014-09-18 04:07:44	freecaster	Noxbru, I have read already antergos wiki, but I failed with some errors, should I send you pastebin?
2014-09-18 04:07:47	khairulalim	i'm never hear that
2014-09-18 04:08:00	khairulalim	where i can learn it?
2014-09-18 04:08:01	freecaster	khairulalim, for example: pacman -S firefox install for you firefox
2014-09-18 04:08:17	khairulalim	like sudo in ubuntu?
2014-09-18 04:08:19	Noxbru	freecaster: sure, and if possible, what you have tried :)
2014-09-18 04:08:24	freecaster	khairulalim, here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_Rosetta
2014-09-18 04:08:51	Noxbru	khairulalim: freecaster is refering to this page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_rosetta
2014-09-18 04:09:03	freecaster	khairulalim, anyways, what's for problems do you have under ubuntu 14.04.1? it should be very stable or not?
2014-09-18 04:09:12	Noxbru	it has the 'translation' between package manager commands for different distros
2014-09-18 04:09:22	freecaster	Noxbru, d'oh! thx
2014-09-18 04:15:39	khairulalim	i don't know, but when i use ubuntu i'm afraid to make a big change, because when i get error i don't know to repair it, so when i get trouble, i usualy fresh install it
2014-09-18 04:15:55	freecaster	ok
2014-09-18 04:16:54	Noxbru	khairulalim: that may be an issue... keeping an Arch/Antergos system usually is harder than Ubuntu
2014-09-18 04:17:10	Noxbru	that said, also usually the wiki is a really big help
2014-09-18 04:17:11	khairulalim	oh i have read pacman rosetta, so, i just need to change sudo apt-get in ubuntu to pacman -s?
2014-09-18 04:18:05	freecaster	apt-get install firefox is in arch linux easy pacman -S firefox

2014-09-18 04:18:36	Noxbru	khairulalim: that 's' is capital 'S' :)
2014-09-18 04:18:55	freecaster	apt-get dist-upgrade is in arch linux pacman -Syu
2014-09-18 04:18:56	khairulalim	ooh, oke oke :)
2014-09-18 04:19:11	freecaster	apt-get update is in arch linux pacman -Syy
2014-09-18 04:19:17	freecaster	easy or not khairulalim ?
2014-09-18 04:19:29	werto	Hi :})
2014-09-18 04:19:32	khairulalim	Noxbru said keeping an arch system usually is harder than ubuntu, is it right?
2014-09-18 04:19:40	werto	Hi freecaster
2014-09-18 04:19:52	khairulalim	yeah, i think it's easy haha
2014-09-18 04:20:01	werto	it's my first Antergos installation, after long long times of Arch
2014-09-18 04:20:07	werto	All I have to say is: awesome
2014-09-18 04:20:33	freecaster	werto, you're new user of antergos? :)
2014-09-18 04:20:39	khairulalim	can you tell me when keeping arch became hard than ubuntu?
2014-09-18 04:20:53	freecaster	welcome to our community werto! :)
2014-09-18 04:21:19	werto	There are some choose that I'm not proud of, like chromium as default browser and Google as default search engine (I prefer Duckduckgo); and also the lock screen. It's different from the default gnome3 one. Except that, everything is awesome, I'd like to help you improve it *
2014-09-18 04:21:20	freecaster	khairulalim, we have own forum: http://forum.antergos.com/

2014-09-18 04:23:45	werto	Sto abbastanza bene, sono molto felice di quest'Autunno in Sicilia.
2014-09-18 04:24:02	freecaster	:)
2014-09-18 04:24:24	werto	Il tedesco mi piace molto, purtroppo però non lo conosco. I'll return speaking in english (I like a lot Welle:Erdball, do you know them?)
2014-09-18 04:24:24	freecaster	werto, do you like spaghetti? xD
2014-09-18 04:24:41	werto	freecaster: i LOVE spaghetti!
2014-09-18 04:24:53	werto	Polari is such a strange irc client
2014-09-18 04:25:41	freecaster	werto, you can install hexchat
2014-09-18 04:25:51	freecaster	werto, do you have xfce?
2014-09-18 04:26:10	werto	freecaster: yes i know, i always used x-chat / hexchat, but polari seems really clear
2014-09-18 04:26:19	freecaster	ok
2014-09-18 04:26:36	freecaster	polari? never heard about it..let me try it
2014-09-18 04:26:37	werto	the only problem I'm having is with /ns identify :}| it doesn't work; and /msg NickServ doesn't work too :}|
2014-09-18 04:26:54	werto	freecaster, polari is the default irc client in Antergos with Gnome :})
2014-09-18 04:27:14	freecaster	werto, aaah you're using gnome3 :)
2014-09-18 04:27:27	freecaster	at honest I don't like it
2014-09-18 04:27:38	Noxbru	werto: really? that have changed since I installed my system
2014-09-18 04:27:40	werto	I loved xfce, and I used tiled wm for long time, but since I discovered that Gnome3 is so clean i went for it and now i love it

2014-09-18 04:30:00	werto	Oh yes, there's also empathy :}) but polari is an irc client; if i do remember empathy is a kind of client that threats irc as an "istant messenger"

2014-09-18 08:11:08	MichaelTunnell	arshavin: it is a minecraft clone basically but it is written in C++ and is FOSS
2014-09-18 08:12:11	sergioAD	arshavin: as MichaelTunnell said is like minecraft but free and writen on C++
2014-09-18 08:12:34	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: sorry,I have never played any minecraft game,just the name sounded similar,anyway nice to know that there is open source alternative for a popular game
2014-09-18 08:13:26	MichaelTunnell	arshavin: it is more important now that Minecraft was bought by Microsoft
2014-09-18 08:13:51	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: yeah,I heard that news just yesterday
2014-09-18 08:13:59	MichaelTunnell	I dont even like minecraft...looks like a stupid game but I know a lot of people who talk about it and minetest so I know a lot more about them than I want to
2014-09-18 08:14:45	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: same here,I have not played it,but I do hear people talking about it alot
2014-09-18 08:16:04	MichaelTunnell	Linux Mint + MATE + Netbook + Brother who has never used Linux = this is going to be interesting
2014-09-18 08:19:37	sergioAD	it is a survivalnature game hahahaha
2014-09-18 08:19:50	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: I took linux to my brother,he liked it,but he can't use it on his own,basically installing part is difficult for non tech users
2014-09-18 08:21:23	MichaelTunnell	arshavin: yea he is technical enough to use the software manager with no issue so I dont think that will be a problem...if he wanted to do ppa then yea that would need me
2014-09-18 08:21:39	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: ironically,without even knowing that linux existed,my first linux install ever fedora 9 sulphur,wen very smooth,no partitions were messed
2014-09-18 08:22:42	arshavin	MichaelTunnell: I even got managed to compile wine and play hitman the very next day

2014-09-18 08:27:57	MichaelTunnell	gnome-session-properties and gnome-session are different packages
2014-09-18 08:28:07	MichaelTunnell	just because one installed does not guarantee the other has to be
2014-09-18 08:29:43	MichaelTunnell	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-session-properties/
2014-09-18 08:30:06	MichaelTunnell	I dont have it installed either but I have it auto starting anyway so not sure why you cant without it
2014-09-18 08:30:12	MichaelTunnell	well not plank but something else
2014-09-18 08:30:57	MichaelTunnell	are you on GNOME3 MichaelP
2014-09-18 08:32:34	MichaelP	MichaelTunnell: running the default gnome the antergos installer installs
2014-09-18 08:34:41	MichaelP	someone in #gnome said desktop file in ~/.config/autostart .. but i have no autostart in ~/.config
2014-09-18 08:36:13	MichaelTunnell	MichaelP: just because it doesnt exist doesnt mean it cant exist
2014-09-18 08:36:21	MichaelTunnell	just make it and put a .desktop file in it
2014-09-18 08:36:49	MichaelTunnell	that is exactly what I did
2014-09-18 08:37:02	MichaelP	how do i do that ?
2014-09-18 08:37:16	MichaelTunnell	copy or create a shortcut to the usr/bin desktop files in that folder and you are done
2014-09-18 08:39:03	MichaelP	as normal user
2014-09-18 08:40:05	MichaelTunnell	~ means your home folder
2014-09-18 08:40:18	MichaelTunnell	/home/michaelp/.config/autostart
2014-09-18 08:40:28	MichaelTunnell	that is what ~/ means
2014-09-18 08:40:52	MichaelTunnell	how long have you been using Linux?
2014-09-18 08:42:45	MichaelP	i mean do i create the short cut from /usr/bin/desktop as normal user
2014-09-18 08:44:34	MichaelTunnell	~/ means home...everything in home is created as normal user
2014-09-18 08:44:55	MichaelTunnell	open two file managers
2014-09-18 08:45:06	MichaelTunnell	navigate to the usr/bin (not desktop in that)
2014-09-18 08:45:21	MichaelTunnell	then create the autostart folder as instructed before
2014-09-18 08:45:50	MichaelTunnell	then hold down control...then drag and drop the desktop file you want to the new autostart folder
2014-09-18 08:46:15	MichaelTunnell	it will then popup a menu to ask you to make a copy or to create a shortcut...choose whichever you want
2014-09-18 08:58:09	MichaelP	ohh so /usr/bin/plank put plank in ~/.config/autostart

2014-10-04 15:05:57	MichaelTunnell	hi
2014-10-04 15:06:03	Noxbru	hi!
2014-10-04 15:07:09	MichaelTunnell	I've been talking with the Antergos dev team about some things and I think we might be able to improve some things in this channel :) I don't want to promise it but it looks good so far.
2014-10-04 15:07:43	Noxbru	nice! what have you talked about?
2014-10-04 15:08:18	MichaelTunnell	fixing the topic, addessing FAQs and other stuff I dont remember :)
2014-10-04 15:08:20	Noxbru	maybe that one of the devs will be here? or that some of the "usuals" will know some of the future dev of the distro?
2014-10-04 15:08:27	Noxbru	ah, nice too
2014-10-04 15:09:14	MichaelTunnell	I am not sure what you mean with the "know future dev" comment
2014-10-04 15:09:28	MichaelTunnell	the first one I don't think is likely but maybe
2014-10-04 15:10:02	Noxbru	I mean more or less "know where the distro is going, in terms of what things are being worked on, more or less when will they land..."
2014-10-04 15:10:54	MichaelTunnell	actually yes that is a possibility in some ways but to what extent I dont know
2014-10-04 15:11:10	Noxbru	for example, imagine that there's work being done to have awesome as a desktop, but it hasn't been talked about it at the forums
2014-10-04 15:11:33	Noxbru	someone might ask about it, and you may answer knowing if it is being done or not, not just on what has been said
2014-10-04 15:12:35	MichaelTunnell	ahh I see well usually the desktop work is setup by a dev who runs said desktop...for example Alexandre does the GNOME version and Dustin does the Cinnamon stuff as they use those themselves
2014-10-04 15:13:20	Noxbru	it was just an example, could be also to add some new program, or substitute another
2014-10-04 15:13:32	Noxbru	for example chromium -> firefox
2014-10-04 15:13:35	MichaelTunnell	I know just providing an answer in case someone asks you
2014-10-04 15:14:05	Noxbru	yes, even if it's just a "it is being discussed as a possibility"
2014-10-04 15:14:13	MichaelTunnell	oh that would be really cool...to let Cnchi offer a choice of Chromium or Firefox or Both
2014-10-04 15:14:17	MichaelTunnell	that would be awesome
2014-10-04 15:14:57	Noxbru	and music player, but that would break a bit with the 'prechosen' programs for every desktop
2014-10-04 15:17:11	MichaelTunnell	I dont think the music player needs to be a separated default question
2014-10-04 15:17:38	MichaelTunnell	there are way too many of them and there are also some people like me that don't use any of them
2014-10-04 15:17:54	MichaelTunnell	I use spotify which is not ever going to be set as default in a distro lol
2014-10-04 15:18:33	Noxbru	I use clementine, even in a gnome environment
2014-10-04 15:18:36	MichaelTunnell	Firefox vs Chromium is a simple one or the other and could be setup as a binary toggle
2014-10-04 15:18:55	MichaelTunnell	that is fine...some people might use guayadeque
2014-10-04 15:19:20	MichaelTunnell	there are just too many to ask up front

2014-10-16 20:04:09	Esco	Well honestly I was just doing that to see which one it was.
2014-10-16 20:04:17	Esco	But thank you for clarifying.
2014-10-16 20:04:54	MichaelTunnell	Esco: oh I see. sorry about that...I will edit the wiki page to make it more clear
2014-10-16 20:05:14	MichaelTunnell	Esco: anyway you need to enable the multilib repo in order to install skype
2014-10-16 20:05:41	MichaelTunnell	http://wiki.antergos.com/Steam
2014-10-16 20:05:57	MichaelTunnell	this is the tutorial for Steam but it will accomplish the same thing for Skype
2014-10-16 20:06:07	Esco	Yep, I was just about to ask.
2014-10-16 20:06:10	MichaelTunnell	just do the multilib part for skype and then install like normal
2014-10-16 20:06:18	Esco	I'll report back in a few and let you know. (:

2014-10-16 20:45:25	MichaelTunnell	Esco: could be Thunar then
2014-10-16 20:45:31	MichaelTunnell	I dont use that so I dont know
2014-10-16 20:45:37	MichaelTunnell	Nautilus and Nemo work just fine for me
2014-10-16 20:45:50	Esco	I'll try google, and if I can't. I'll switch my file manager.
2014-10-16 20:46:01	MichaelTunnell	you should consider trying Caja...it is actually more powerful than Thunar and just as light. It was made by the MATE teem
2014-10-16 20:46:02	MichaelTunnell	team
2014-10-16 20:46:16	Esco	How exactly do I switch?
2014-10-16 20:46:24	Esco	I'm completely Lunix noob. Sorry.

2014-10-16 20:47:12	MichaelTunnell	how long have you been using linux?
2014-10-16 20:47:49	Esco	I used Ubuntu for a few weeks quite a while back ago.
2014-10-16 20:48:02	Esco	But I finally got Antergos up and running last night.
2014-10-16 20:48:11	MichaelTunnell	wow alright you are brave
2014-10-16 20:48:56	MichaelTunnell	Antergos makes Arch easier but it is still a system for people who can or at least willing to handle stuff going wrong because even though it doesnt happen a lot it will happen.
2014-10-16 20:49:11	Aethysius	MichaelTunnell: Before Antergos all I used was Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Mint.
2014-10-16 20:49:19	MichaelTunnell	if you are aware of that and still make the commitment to try it then have fun. :)
2014-10-16 20:49:57	MichaelTunnell	Aethysius: that is fine...matters length of time rather than what exactly...someone who has only used Ubuntu for a couple weeks wont have much linux knowledge to utilize so it could be an issue
2014-10-16 20:50:05	Esco	Well, I didn't want something too easy.
2014-10-16 20:50:10	MichaelTunnell	I need to go for a bit but feel free to message me and I will respond when i get back

2014-10-17 09:44:22	bainjaming	Hey guys, quick question. Does Antergos use the same repos as archlinux? Just wondering, because I'm a huge fan of how extensive the archlinux repos are and would therefore be a fan of this.
2014-10-17 09:44:34	Noxbru	bainjaming: yes, it does
2014-10-17 09:45:09	bainjaming	That's great. That's gonna save me a lot of time getting working desktop installs going then. Thanks!

2014-10-23 13:02:27	Psi-Jack	But, yeah, so far, mr_chris is right. The only way to reasonably run Antergos currently is with a base install and disable the antergos repos immediately.
2014-10-23 13:02:48	Noxbru	Psi-Jack: may I ask why?

2014-10-23 13:04:26	mr_chris	Noxbru, The Antergos lightdm configuration is unstable at best. In one instance, backspace was deleting the password entirely. In another, it was allowing me to login without supplying a password at all.
2014-10-23 13:04:29	Psi-Jack	The installation of features, or Desktop Environment, are very very broken, to the point causing conflicts, and other major issues. Heck, even lightdm's setup as is is also the worse login I;ve ever seen.
2014-10-23 13:04:38	Psi-Jack	And that.
2014-10-23 13:04:58	mr_chris	Noxbru, The way you gain root access is by a single file in sudoers.d called 10_install that have and single entry for your username.
2014-10-23 13:05:04	mr_chris	It should be grouped based.
2014-10-23 13:06:05	mr_chris	Noxbru, Antergeros replaces 10_linux with 10_antergeros in the grub.d configuration which makes any non-standard kernels (linux-lts, linux-ck) fail to boot. Switching those files resolves it.
2014-10-23 13:06:50	Noxbru	Mmmm... I'm too old for all those issues :)
2014-10-23 13:07:08	mr_chris	Noxbru, The cinnamon setup in my experience was buggy. The lock screen misbehaved by asking for a message to the user before locking it. Going from a base install, removing the Antergeros repo, then doing the Cinnamon  setup manually resolved all issues I had with it.
2014-10-23 13:08:07	mr_chris	So the solution to all of those was to use the Cnchi installer for a base setup, remove the Antergeros repo, remove the Antergeros grub modifications, and do the rest manually.
2014-10-23 13:08:18	mr_chris	Which still saved me a couple of hours of initial Arch setup.
2014-10-23 13:08:37	mr_chris	I'm tempted to fork Antergeros and make turn it into a simplified base only installer.
2014-10-23 13:08:42	mr_chris	With no modifications.
2014-10-23 13:09:41	Noxbru	mr_chris: I don't think that a fork would be the best thing... have you tried contacting with the devs for solving all these issues?
2014-10-23 13:10:30	mr_chris	The issues I've had are already in the github issues list. The bad ones anyways.
2014-10-23 13:10:47	mr_chris	I guess I could contribute to Antergeros instead. See if I can add the option to disable all modifications.
2014-10-23 13:10:54	mr_chris	That's all I wanted out of it in the first place.

2014-10-23 13:11:20	mr_chris	Just an easy Arch. No extra repos. No modifications. Arch works fine. Don't mess with it.
2014-10-23 13:11:21	Noxbru	plain installation with no extras, isn't it?
2014-10-23 13:11:33	mr_chris	*an easy Arch install
2014-10-23 13:11:45	mr_chris	What I have now is.

2014-10-23 13:14:04	Noxbru	but also, the devs I guess that work on Antergos in their free time, so every help that we can give them will be useful

2014-10-23 13:39:20	fro_hun	hello everyone! need som help. after updating, upgrading the whole system (included kernel update) the lightdm-webkit-greeter fails to load the default antergos theme. i tried after that, to download a custom theme, but that one fails too. grapicallydescribed the error: it has an ubuntu like wallpaper insted of the originals, and the user picture is just a tipycal no picture found pic. if i type in my pa
2014-10-23 13:39:27	fro_hun	ssword it does nothing. no login or anything. any idea?
2014-10-23 13:44:47	mr_chris	fro_hun, Antergeros's lightdm setup is pretty broken. I would suggest one of two things.
2014-10-23 13:46:27	mr_chris	fro_hun, 1. drop to a console. Stop lightdm. pacman -Rs every package having to do with lightdm. Delete /etc/lightdm. Temporarily disable the antergeros repo in pacman.conf. run pacman -Syy lightdm lightdm-webkit-greeter.
2014-10-23 13:46:34	mr_chris	Then reenable the antergeros repo.
2014-10-23 13:46:41	mr_chris	2. Switch to a different login manager.

2014-10-28 18:51:39	Altri	Hello
2014-10-28 18:52:11	Altri	I would like to know if there's a way to change my DE from Gnome without having to do a fresh install
2014-10-28 18:53:09	Aethysius	To which DE do you want to switch?
2014-10-28 18:53:20	Altri	probably Cinnamon
2014-10-28 18:54:02	Aethysius	Just look up the packages with pacman (or your wrapper of choice)
2014-10-28 18:54:19	Aethysius	Download, install, logout, and bam, log into said DE.
2014-10-28 18:54:46	Altri	Alright cool so it's like how it works in Ubuntu
2014-10-28 18:55:01	Altri	thanks :) I've only used Ubuntu so I didn't know haha

2014-11-01 07:43:42	Noxbru	don't worry, we always have an 'it's early, I still haven't had my coffee moment'
2014-11-01 07:43:45	phut	yeah that is correct
2014-11-01 07:43:52	MichaelTunnell	it does not, only dd and SUSE Image Writer work
2014-11-01 07:43:55	phut	dd looks like the simplest answer
2014-11-01 07:44:06	MichaelTunnell	because SUSE Image Writer is just a frontend gui to dd
2014-11-01 07:45:26	MichaelTunnell	unetbootin and others try to add their own stuff to it like installed casper and others...Antergos is meant for 1 to 1 copy, like dd does which is why the breaks happen
2014-11-01 07:46:36	Noxbru	bye!
2014-11-01 07:46:41	<--	Noxbru (~noxbru@213.231.112.25.dyn.user.ono.com) has left #antergos
2014-11-01 07:48:04	MichaelTunnell	speaking of which I need to go make some coffee
2014-11-01 07:51:08	phut	ohh I see
2014-11-01 07:53:03	phut	I've heard good things about antergos but I haven't tried it yet
2014-11-01 07:55:04	MichaelTunnell	phut: I like it. :)
2014-11-01 07:55:27	phut	I'm a long time linux mint user, but getting fed up with cannonical
2014-11-01 07:55:48	phut	I like my os to just work and to be simple to install so I can focus on the things I get payed to do
2014-11-01 07:56:05	MichaelTunnell	why are you fed up with canonical yet are a linux mint user since canonical has nothing to do with mint
2014-11-01 07:56:07	phut	antergos sounds like it might be better than ubuntu based distro
2014-11-01 07:56:17	phut	mint is ubuntu++
2014-11-01 07:56:22	phut	mostly just ubuntu
2014-11-01 07:56:26	MichaelTunnell	not really no
2014-11-01 07:56:33	phut	yeah really yeah lol
2014-11-01 07:56:37	MichaelTunnell	especially with Mint 17 LTS switch
2014-11-01 07:56:44	phut	that's what I'm on now
2014-11-01 07:56:56	phut	most of the packages come from ubuntu repos you see
2014-11-01 07:57:12	phut	now they are breaking versions from cannonical that's good
2014-11-01 07:57:14	MichaelTunnell	Mint 17 will be LTS until 16.04 meaning none of the improvements that Canonical makes will be in Mint
2014-11-01 07:57:20	phut	yeah
2014-11-01 07:57:24	phut	I read the blog :p
2014-11-01 07:57:38	MichaelTunnell	phut: I know all about the Ubuntu/Mint situation but that is not a good thing
2014-11-01 07:57:42	MichaelTunnell	unless you love old packages
2014-11-01 07:58:06	phut	I liked LMDE for a while but you gotta micromanage the update packs or it'll break the system
2014-11-01 07:58:28	phut	that defeats the point of using something that doesn't require me to micromanage it
2014-11-01 07:58:37	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is Arch based so you will be micormanaging the updates MUCH more
2014-11-01 07:58:42	phut	aha
2014-11-01 07:59:00	phut	someone told me that I won't have to micromanage it as much >.<
2014-11-01 07:59:02	MichaelTunnell	Arch is designed for bleeding edge updates...it is not created for the average user
2014-11-01 07:59:09	phut	I'm not an average user
2014-11-01 07:59:21	MichaelTunnell	have you ever used arch before?
2014-11-01 07:59:30	phut	I'm a professional user who prefers to spend his time coding instead of configuring fscking os
2014-11-01 07:59:39	phut	no I've never used arch before for the reason you mentioned
2014-11-01 08:00:01	phut	in another channel someone was saying that antergos was arch with less hassle
2014-11-01 08:00:09	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is an easy installer for Arch but once that is done it becomes Arch thus all of the caveats of using arch are still there
2014-11-01 08:00:16	phut	every hour I have to spend on my os is an hour I'm not getting payed for
2014-11-01 08:00:21	phut	ahh
2014-11-01 08:00:26	phut	yeah
2014-11-01 08:00:44	MichaelTunnell	you get an easier experience but it is not Ubuntu to Debian style
2014-11-01 08:00:49	phut	the point of using a distro is to have someone else do all the grunt work for you imho
2014-11-01 08:00:56	MichaelTunnell	there is actually nothing like this structure that could be compared to
2014-11-01 08:01:04	phut	might as well just use lfs
2014-11-01 08:01:25	phut	I heard pacman is really nice
2014-11-01 08:01:28	MichaelTunnell	well that is rather absurd but if you dont want to do anything that is fine...a lot of people have that opinion and in some cases I agree
2014-11-01 08:01:40	MichaelTunnell	I dont want to compile everything like Gentoo but I do want control over my packages
2014-11-01 08:02:13	MichaelTunnell	pacman is very nice and very fast...there are a couple things that annoy me as a frequent user but still better than apt
2014-11-01 08:02:42	MichaelTunnell	with apt all of the commands are separate or extended
2014-11-01 08:03:11	MichaelTunnell	you look at version info in apt you use apt-cache in pacman it is just "pacman -Q"
2014-11-01 08:03:38	MichaelTunnell	to install in apt it is "apt-get install pkg" but pacman is "pacman -S pkg"
2014-11-01 08:04:03	MichaelTunnell	it is more sensible I suppose since everything is inside the pacman tool
2014-11-01 08:04:24	phut	I'm really used to using apt and the one click updates in mint
2014-11-01 08:04:55	phut	I don't have to worry about the updates breaking my system
2014-11-01 08:04:58	MichaelTunnell	but Arch and therefore Antergos are not intended to be handsoff distro so if someone wants that then other options would be better
2014-11-01 08:05:08	phut	if the update breaks my system then that's a few hours of not getting payed to work ahead of me
2014-11-01 08:05:09	phut	:/
2014-11-01 08:05:37	MichaelTunnell	Intel removed microcode from the kernel for autoloading so in Arch this was an issue for many people as they had to manually correct this
2014-11-01 08:05:43	MichaelTunnell	that is not the Ubuntu way :)
2014-11-01 08:06:00	phut	whats the benefit of using arch aside from more work?
2014-11-01 08:06:14	phut	it runs a little faster I hear
2014-11-01 08:06:18	MichaelTunnell	Arch warns you before a break can happen so you dont do it without warning (unless you ignore the news pages, then no warning)
2014-11-01 08:06:25	phut	thats cool
2014-11-01 08:06:47	MichaelTunnell	it is faster, leaner because you control everything that gets installed
2014-11-01 08:06:52	phut	I figured I'd throw it on a spare partition and play with it in spare time
2014-11-01 08:06:54	phut	that's cool
2014-11-01 08:07:08	MichaelTunnell	then the bleeding edge software...Arch gets updates to everything before any other distro
2014-11-01 08:07:17	MichaelTunnell	the maintainers are ridiculously fast
2014-11-01 08:07:27	phut	in my experience bleeding edge often means more bugs too
2014-11-01 08:07:31	phut	that's cool
2014-11-01 08:07:41	MichaelTunnell	sure hence the term "bleeding" :)
2014-11-01 08:07:45	phut	yeah
2014-11-01 08:08:01	phut	I want a rolling distro that's stable and has safe updates
2014-11-01 08:08:07	phut	I don't know if that exists
2014-11-01 08:08:13	phut	debian isn't quite there yet :/
2014-11-01 08:08:16	MichaelTunnell	Antergos kind of gives a bandaid but doesnt carterize the wound :)
2014-11-01 08:08:31	phut	the reason for a rolling distro is so I don't have to waste time reinstalling os
2014-11-01 08:08:44	MichaelTunnell	Debian is that with Testing. Their Testing branch is very much heavily tested
2014-11-01 08:08:47	phut	lts  versions are a good second choice for not wasting time
2014-11-01 08:09:16	phut	I guess that makes sense. I haven't used debian in ages aside from LMDE which is based on unstable
2014-11-01 08:09:17	MichaelTunnell	openSUSE has become a rolling release with the merge of Tumbleweed and the Factory
2014-11-01 08:09:33	phut	yast was pretty nasty when I last tried suse
2014-11-01 08:10:02	MichaelTunnell	Debian's branch makes are stupid really...Testing is actually very stable. Unstable is fairly stable actually...their truly unstable branch is called Experimental
2014-11-01 08:10:16	MichaelTunnell	you can replace yast
2014-11-01 08:10:17	phut	that makes sense
2014-11-01 08:10:58	MichaelTunnell	Fedora has Rawhide though they do not have a PPA solution yet...but are working on one
2014-11-01 08:11:22	phut	I usually avoid fedora like the plague but I use RH for work a lot
2014-11-01 08:12:00	MichaelTunnell	SolydXK used to be the solution for Rolling based Debian but with a great structure....unfortunately they destroyed their structure about 3 or 4 months ago and it is now just a shell of disappointment
2014-11-01 08:12:22	phut	that sucks
2014-11-01 08:12:25	MichaelTunnell	why avoid Fedora?
2014-11-01 08:12:56	phut	I had bad experiences with fedora in the early 2000's, I never got the sour taste out of my mouth
2014-11-01 08:13:20	phut	that was a long time ago though
2014-11-01 08:14:01	MichaelTunnell	yea you could say that about all of Linux back then though :)
2014-11-01 08:14:12	MichaelTunnell	I used Debian in 1999 and it was a mess
2014-11-01 08:14:22	phut	true
2014-11-01 08:14:37	phut	I last used open suse in version 10.1 I think
2014-11-01 08:14:47	phut	suse was my first distro though
2014-11-01 08:15:04	MichaelTunnell	openSUSE is good but certainly things piss me off and yea they are dumb things
2014-11-01 08:15:13	MichaelTunnell	openSUSE 1 Click Install = 15 clicks
2014-11-01 08:15:27	MichaelTunnell	that annoys me much more than it should lol
2014-11-01 08:16:05	MichaelTunnell	the OBS is kind of a PPA solution but also kind of isnt so hard to say on that one
2014-11-01 08:16:13	MichaelTunnell	overall I do like openSUSE though
2014-11-01 08:16:25	MichaelTunnell	and Fedora has been MUCH better since 17
2014-11-01 08:16:40	MichaelTunnell	17+ is Fedora getting better and better
2014-11-01 08:17:06	phut	nice
2014-11-01 08:17:07	MichaelTunnell	Fedora 20 is super solid as an rpm distro
2014-11-01 08:19:03	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is Arch Made Easier...but still not "easy". If you want to play with it then by all means but don't expect it to act like Ubuntu or derivs that get out of the way...most of the time it is out of your way...it is like a little nephew who doesnt come around much but when he does you have a 50/50 shot whether he is an annoying like prick or slightly irritating. :)
2014-11-01 08:19:14	phut	I might have to try fedora out again
2014-11-01 08:19:14	phut	how comparable is it to rh 6.5/6.6?
2014-11-01 08:19:15	phut	test
2014-11-01 08:19:15	phut	dumb wifi
2014-11-01 08:19:21	phut	the main thing is updates
2014-11-01 08:19:40	phut	I'm a minimalist so I don't need much package suppport
2014-11-01 08:19:58	MichaelTunnell	Fedora is good with updates if you enable Rawhide
2014-11-01 08:20:00	phut	IF it needs updates the updates should just update
2014-11-01 08:20:08	phut	not break the system
2014-11-01 08:20:15	MichaelTunnell	cute...idealist I see
2014-11-01 08:20:18	phut	if the update breaks the system the maintainers aren't doing their jobs
2014-11-01 08:20:27	MichaelTunnell	this is Linux :)
2014-11-01 08:20:30	phut	I don't maintain a distro because that would be too much work
2014-11-01 08:20:35	phut	what are you saying?
2014-11-01 08:20:35	phut	lol
2014-11-01 08:20:44	phut	that almost sounds like an insult
2014-11-01 08:20:46	phut	to linux
2014-11-01 08:20:49	MichaelTunnell	no distro provides the best of both worlds
2014-11-01 08:20:55	phut	true
2014-11-01 08:21:01	MichaelTunnell	you either get VERY slow updates or you get breakage
2014-11-01 08:21:05	phut	do one thing and do it well
2014-11-01 08:21:07	MichaelTunnell	or potential breakage
2014-11-01 08:21:18	phut	most of them fail at that mantra
2014-11-01 08:21:55	MichaelTunnell	I've had Antergos break only once but it was my fault because I didnt test 3.15 kernel with the nvidia drivers before switching to nvidia drivers
2014-11-01 08:21:55	phut	instead they do many things poorly
2014-11-01 08:22:03	phut	I see
2014-11-01 08:22:06	phut	that makes sense
2014-11-01 08:22:14	phut	and a video driver problem isn't too bad
2014-11-01 08:22:23	phut	it should be simple enough to fix
2014-11-01 08:22:33	MichaelTunnell	well the issue is not obvious though...you have to figure out what the problem is
2014-11-01 08:22:35	phut	or load the old kernel
2014-11-01 08:22:51	MichaelTunnell	luckily I went into a channel where someone had already experienced the exact same thing a day before
2014-11-01 08:22:56	phut	nice
2014-11-01 08:23:15	MichaelTunnell	yea I reverted the kernel until the fix was out
2014-11-01 08:23:22	MichaelTunnell	only took 12 hours for the fix to make it live
2014-11-01 08:23:28	phut	that's not bad
2014-11-01 08:23:38	MichaelTunnell	I think you mean that is amazing
2014-11-01 08:23:39	MichaelTunnell	lol
2014-11-01 08:23:44	phut	yeaht aht's really good
2014-11-01 08:23:57	MichaelTunnell	no other distro is that fast with fixes even big issues like that
2014-11-01 08:24:09	MichaelTunnell	not even Gentoo is that fast
2014-11-01 08:24:23	phut	gentoo is kind of funny sometimes
2014-11-01 08:24:34	phut	it's the distro for growing epeens a lot of time
2014-11-01 08:24:38	MichaelTunnell	I've tested the update speed of every distro :) and that is why I use Arch
2014-11-01 08:25:36	MichaelTunnell	though when I convert someone over to Linux they always get Mint, I like Arch for me but I'm not insane. :)
2014-11-01 08:25:38	phut	there are a lot of people in linux mint chat that like to use arch
2014-11-01 08:26:06	phut	but then when I ask them about it they talk about spending ridiculous amounts of time setting up and configuring stuff
2014-11-01 08:27:40	MichaelTunnell	yea exactly why I use Antergos :)
2014-11-01 08:28:03	MichaelTunnell	the issue for me is I never want to do the setup or configure again
2014-11-01 08:28:08	phut	right
2014-11-01 08:28:12	MichaelTunnell	did it years ago and once is enough
2014-11-01 08:28:16	phut	nice
2014-11-01 08:28:34	phut	is it a pain to get flash up or anything like that?
2014-11-01 08:29:01	MichaelTunnell	Arch proper is a pain in the ass unless you like to tinker. Antergos gives you the ability to tinker but doesnt require it
2014-11-01 08:29:18	phut	that sounds about right
2014-11-01 08:29:22	MichaelTunnell	phut: if you the BASE install then you install everything after the basic arch yourself
2014-11-01 08:29:46	phut	does it have nifty meta packages?
2014-11-01 08:29:47	MichaelTunnell	if you use a DE like GNOME or Cinnamon then Cinchi will setup a lot of stuff for you and it will ask you about flash
2014-11-01 08:30:07	phut	like 'pacman -S arch-meta-xfce'
2014-11-01 08:30:19	phut	I usually use xfce as my de
2014-11-01 08:30:33	MichaelTunnell	I dont know about meta stuff...I have never used xfce in Antergos because I hate it but to each their own
2014-11-01 08:30:47	phut	why do you hate xfce?
2014-11-01 08:31:55	MichaelTunnell	5 updates in 11 years is pathetic, they have no plans for Wayland, they claimed that 4.12 would be out in January 2013 (it still isnt out), they claimed 4.12 would have early stages of GTK3 support but in October of 2013 they abandoned it completely.
2014-11-01 08:32:00	phut	I kill the panel and keybind windowlist and menu  to maximize window space
2014-11-01 08:32:16	phut	4.12 has a ppa repo for ubuntu
2014-11-01 08:32:18	MichaelTunnell	They use old technologies, they never meet the roadmaps they set, they have no plans to face the inevitable
2014-11-01 08:32:31	MichaelTunnell	that is just beta 4.11
2014-11-01 08:32:45	MichaelTunnell	just because you can use experimental code doesnt mean it is released
2014-11-01 08:33:13	MichaelTunnell	and the updates they've made in their github has been translations only for the last 6 months
2014-11-01 08:33:37	MichaelTunnell	phut: why not use Openbox if you kill the xfce panel anyway?
2014-11-01 08:33:40	phut	https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/xfce-4.12
2014-11-01 08:33:41	phut	that's interesting
2014-11-01 08:33:41	phut	is wayland shipping yet?
2014-11-01 08:33:48	MichaelTunnell	Openbox doesnt even need a panel
2014-11-01 08:34:17	MichaelTunnell	not as default no...but it is available to use in Arch, openSUSE and Fedora with a little in Debian
2014-11-01 08:35:47	MichaelTunnell	but it has been over 2 1/2 years since 4.10 and still no 4.12 which will have absolutely ZERO gtk3 or qt support...meaning when 4.12 comes out it will mean nothing. 4.14 will probably have partial gtk3 support in 2 more years and then 4.16 will have gtk3 support after another 2 years...by that time GTK4 will probably be out
2014-11-01 08:36:17	MichaelTunnell	MATE can do everything that XFCE can do, it also does it much more elegantly and is even 40% lighter on resources than XFCE
2014-11-01 08:36:23	phut	yeha
2014-11-01 08:36:31	phut	I am a creature of habit really
2014-11-01 08:36:52	phut	I've been using xfce for several years so I'm just used to it
2014-11-01 08:37:32	MichaelTunnell	that is a fine reason to use it...but not a reason that it is any good at all. So you never claimed it was a good DE and thus we are in agreement.
2014-11-01 08:37:42	MichaelTunnell	I hate xfce but I dont care if people use it :)
2014-11-01 08:37:56	MichaelTunnell	just like I hate WordPress but I dont care if people use it...doesn't mean I have to :)
2014-11-01 08:39:44	MichaelTunnell	I just expect xfce to die a painful death...painful to the users...because there will not be a gradual death...it will be abrupt and it will be catastrophic in the sense that users will never be able to update any packages anymore as gtk2 is 99% dead, distros will abandon it immediately thus no new distro updates and so on
2014-11-01 08:40:27	MichaelTunnell	it just makes me sad that after all these years of Linux getting more and more user friendly...all of the xfce users will eventually have an experience with Linux that I used to in the late 90s

2014-11-01 12:29:31	MichaelTunnell	you could just remove the gnome-terminal package

2014-11-01 14:47:11	MichaelTunnell	you need to install the driver first
2014-11-01 14:47:23	MichaelTunnell	the only way to do that is with ethernet and then install the driver

2014-11-01 14:47:40	MichaelTunnell	but I would suggest installing via ethernet instead of wifi because it will be MUCH faster
2014-11-01 14:47:43	Spiffy	that's my problem with every distro but Ubuntu :(
2014-11-01 14:48:08	MichaelTunnell	ethernet is better imo
2014-11-01 14:48:09	Spiffy	I don't have ethernet. I'm currently living in a hotel
2014-11-01 14:48:18	MichaelTunnell	oh interesting
2014-11-01 14:49:03	Spiffy	I'm a contractor in another country right now, so while i'm here, so I'm staying at a hotel for a few months. so no ethernet sadly
2014-11-01 14:50:05	MichaelTunnell	you can download the tar.xz file from pacman and save it on another usb drive then install the live iso to usb and while iso is loaded you could then install via the tar.xz file
2014-11-01 14:50:12	MichaelTunnell	then activate the wifi after that
2014-11-01 14:50:15	MichaelTunnell	it should work
2014-11-01 14:50:23	MichaelTunnell	Spiffy: try that
2014-11-01 14:50:51	Spiffy	alright. sounds like a plan
2014-11-01 14:52:43	MichaelTunnell	btw the command is
2014-11-01 14:52:56	MichaelTunnell	sudo pacman -U package-name.tar.xz
2014-11-01 14:53:17	MichaelTunnell	you would need to cd to the folder or includ the folder path in the command

2014-11-01 18:55:40	AidanCollier	Hello! I'm having a big problem with a fresh install I performed today. After selecting GNOME as my desktop and enabling the installation of printing software it seems the GNOME Control Center's Print settings doesn't recognize any of the CUPS and HPLIP software I had installed with the update, instead printing out: "Sorry, The System Printing Service doesn't seem to be available" (Under the frowning computer
2014-11-01 18:55:41	AidanCollier	monitor). What would be the problem here?
2014-11-01 18:58:00	juliohm	AidanCollier, we had an update recently for the CUPS packages
2014-11-01 18:58:06	juliohm	look it up to see if something changed
2014-11-01 18:58:31	juliohm	I'm a normal user as yourself
2014-11-01 19:02:44	AidanCollier	I had done a fresh install just earlier this week, and the GNOME printing service worked very well, so I'd take it that the update did trip up GNOME 3.14 (Which would make sense enough given that I still see a few unfixed errors with GTK themeing regardless of which distro I'd try GNOME on!).
2014-11-01 19:04:52	AidanCollier	Would you know how I could possibly use pacman to downgrade the GNOME package to the version, 3.13?
2014-11-01 19:05:24	AidanCollier	Or rather 3.12?
2014-11-01 19:06:07	MichaelTunnell	AidanCollier: 3.14 is perfectly fine...I use it in fact
2014-11-01 19:06:37	MichaelTunnell	but if you will need to downgrade a LOT of packages and then you will need to ignorepkg them all
2014-11-01 19:06:38	AidanCollier	Do you still use the Numix Frost theme with it?
2014-11-01 19:06:53	MichaelTunnell	AidanCollier: I have my own theme but is based on numix
2014-11-01 19:08:58	MichaelTunnell	AidanCollier: have you tried reinstalling the cups and hplip packages? there may have been an update issue but that might solve it
2014-11-01 19:09:46	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: I'll give reinstalling the packages a try.
2014-11-01 19:11:25	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: The error message doesn't seem to have been solved, so I'll restart my computer quickly and see if the services would need to reload.
2014-11-01 19:11:49	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: I'll be back!

2014-11-01 19:49:51	MichaelTunnell	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgbuild how to make a pkgbuild
2014-11-01 19:50:05	MichaelTunnell	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages how to install via pacman
2014-11-01 19:50:21	MichaelTunnell	essentially you turn the pkgbuild into a pacman build
2014-11-01 19:50:38	MichaelTunnell	or like I said, you can use yaourt or something else...there are actually a lot of helpers
2014-11-01 19:50:51	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: My method which I took form the arch wiki is 1) extract the tarball 2) cd into the extracted folder and 3) run makepkg -s -i.
2014-11-01 19:50:58	MichaelTunnell	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helper
2014-11-01 19:52:46	MichaelTunnell	do not use -i
2014-11-01 19:53:00	MichaelTunnell	use pacman to install the compiled file not makepkg
2014-11-01 19:54:30	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: I tried thw method with installing the brackets editor, and makepkg seems to have worked just fine.
2014-11-01 19:55:34	MichaelTunnell	what is the issue then
2014-11-01 19:56:17	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: I just wanted to check my building procedures in advance, but know I know.
2014-11-01 19:56:53	MichaelTunnell	pacman is the best practice
2014-11-01 19:57:02	MichaelTunnell	that I would change next time
2014-11-01 19:57:08	MichaelTunnell	or use a helper since they are much faster
2014-11-01 19:57:13	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: Is it because of dependency resolution?
2014-11-01 19:58:17	MichaelTunnell	AidanCollier: no ask makepkg can do that for the compile
2014-11-01 19:58:39	MichaelTunnell	it is to give pacman control over it and acknowledge the existence of it
2014-11-01 19:59:04	MichaelTunnell	not using pacman means that pacman wont cache it or detect version or etc
2014-11-01 19:59:26	AidanCollier	MichaelTunnell: Good point. I'll certainly put that into practice!
2014-11-01 19:59:30	AidanCollier	Bye!
2014-11-01 19:59:34	MichaelTunnell	ok good
2014-11-01 19:59:36	MichaelTunnell	cya
2014-11-01 19:59:55	MichaelTunnell	or use an aur helper

2014-11-02 04:27:46	NuSuey	ah.. heard about that one, even followed it on twitter
2014-11-02 04:27:55	NuSuey	arch users still hate it
2014-11-02 04:28:32	freecaster	NuSuey, why do they hate it? It's very easy to install and save your time! :)
2014-11-02 04:28:45	freecaster	see comments on sourceforge
2014-11-02 04:28:48	NuSuey	because it's not the "arch - install way"
2014-11-02 04:29:23	[A]ethysius	The Arch Way can be summed up into four letters. RTFM.
2014-11-02 04:29:26	NuSuey	well why do that when I'm running a completely perfect running distro? :)
2014-11-02 04:29:26	freecaster	arch install way is very hard, and is the reason why a lot of linuxusers did not tried ever arch linux :)
2014-11-02 04:29:37	NuSuey	freecaster:  I know
2014-11-02 04:29:40	NuSuey	[A]ethysius: yup

2014-11-03 22:15:25	ccccccc	hi, anyone knows how many data does an antergos install download?
2014-11-03 22:15:57	MichaelTunnell	lastdays: this is a common issue...if still around I will link you
2014-11-03 22:16:01	ccccccc	I have over 2 hours on a slow connection
2014-11-03 22:16:37	MichaelTunnell	ccccccc: quite a lot...every single package is downloaded so it depends on what DE you chose to use and what extras you selected
2014-11-03 22:17:05	MichaelTunnell	slow connections can take a long time since the only way to be up to date as fast as Arch updates is to download everything upon install
2014-11-03 22:18:05	MichaelTunnell	lastdays: try this http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?p=10816&sid=c323c8fa26f948a2e69453443822d4dd#p10816
2014-11-03 22:18:17	ccccccc	MichaelTunnell: thanks I got the cinnamon one, I think know I know an estimated time if its the same as Arch
2014-11-03 22:18:35	ccccccc	its about 3GB , a little less
2014-11-03 22:18:41	MichaelTunnell	it isnt the same but yes it uses arch packages
2014-11-03 22:19:32	MichaelTunnell	ccccccc: you're welcome, hope you enjoy Antergos
2014-11-03 22:20:00	ccccccc	All right, I think this will take all night long, thanks for the info, will check back tomorrow :)

2014-11-03 22:54:51	MichaelTunnell	these are not the only reasons but they are rather big reasons
2014-11-03 22:55:09	MichaelTunnell	there are many other reasons that are even worse such as taking credit for work they dont actually do
2014-11-03 22:55:49	MichaelTunnell	why did you want the link?
2014-11-03 22:57:00	Aethysius	Discussions about distros, someone brought up Manjaro, and I was like: >.<

2014-11-04 14:20:13	ulipo1991	hi all
2014-11-04 14:21:18	MichaelTunnell	hello
2014-11-04 14:21:28	ulipo1991	am having a issue, i have dual boot with win 7 and antergos, my problem comes only when i am logged in antergos the internet start to fail
2014-11-04 14:22:00	ulipo1991	i am guessing that consumes more bandwidth or it blocks the other devices to connect to the network
2014-11-04 14:22:51	ulipo1991	because in all my devices work properly while am on windows, if i switch to antergos i starts the problem with the wifi in my other devices
2014-11-04 14:23:01	ulipo1991	any ideas?
2014-11-04 14:24:09	MichaelTunnell	ulipo1991: Windows is not friendly to anything else so it could be Windows
2014-11-04 14:24:23	MichaelTunnell	however you need to check to see if your hardware works with the linux kernel
2014-11-04 14:24:38	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is not in control of the hardware support, that is a kernel thing
2014-11-04 14:26:12	ulipo1991	oh i guees i didn´t explain correctly, when am in windows i have no problem with other devices on my network, but as soon i change to antergos, i have to reset the modem to try to connect my cellphone or other devices and at the end it never connect to the internet, but i switch back to windows the internet on my phone starts to work properly

2014-11-04 17:34:23	AidanCollier	Hello again!
2014-11-04 17:35:17	crash_	hi
2014-11-04 17:35:27	AidanCollier	I take it we can discuss development here, correct?
2014-11-04 17:35:57	crash_	i think so yes
2014-11-04 17:36:16	AidanCollier	crash_: Thanks for letting me know!
2014-11-04 17:36:26	crash_	i'm not a developer, but maybe someone else can answer your question
2014-11-04 17:37:20	AidanCollier	crash_: It's just good to now I can be heard by the developers here!
2014-11-04 17:37:50	AidanCollier	As of using the latest up-to-date version, I have found a few bugs so far.
2014-11-04 17:38:25	crash_	i have been using the cnhi-dev installer yes, if that is what you are asking :)
2014-11-04 17:38:52	AidanCollier	First, the lightdm lock extension for GNOME 3 is unsupported by 3.14. I bet this will be fixed?
2014-11-04 17:39:10	AidanCollier	crash_: Somewhat!
2014-11-04 17:39:46	AidanCollier	crash_:Unfortunately that's just one question.
2014-11-04 17:39:50	crash_	i see

2014-11-04 17:40:09	crash_	extensions is out of hand of the antergos developers
2014-11-04 17:40:51	AidanCollier	So another developer would update the lightdm lock button to support 3.14?
2014-11-04 17:41:34	crash_	the developer of that extensions will update it in the future i hope
2014-11-04 17:44:11	AidanCollier	Same with me! The GNOME lock button had been disabled as well (which I know can be a fairly easy fix) but I love the look of the lightdm greeter.
2014-11-04 17:45:05	crash_	what is your other problems so far?
2014-11-04 17:46:21	AidanCollier	My next question is one about Cnchi. When I installed Antergos from the August 2014 snapshot it seems that when I enabled Libreoffice to be installed, the Cnchi actually forgot to install it.
2014-11-04 17:47:53	crash_	that is weird, but a simple pacman -S libreoffice should do it for you? but i always do alt-f2 cnchi-dev and i get the latest installer.
2014-11-04 17:48:28	AidanCollier	Cnchi-dev is included in the regular ISO?
2014-11-04 17:49:37	crash_	yes it's a command to let you update to the latest cnchi installer if you want too
2014-11-04 17:51:59	AidanCollier	I do know that I can install the libreoffice package from pacman, but I just get uncomfortable when Cnchi forgot it.
2014-11-04 17:52:48	AidanCollier	I bet the bug was certainly fixed since then.
2014-11-04 17:53:01	crash_	yeah i think that is a bug it must be
2014-11-04 17:53:29	crash_	but try cnchi-dev if you ever are gonna re-install antergos :)
2014-11-04 17:53:52	AidanCollier	I'll be sure to.
2014-11-04 17:54:11	crash_	:)
2014-11-04 17:54:29	crash_	are there any more problems so far?
2014-11-04 17:56:21	AidanCollier	I do have other problems, but while we're on the topic of Cnchi (Which looks very nice), I'm wondering if you would know why it is still written in Python, when writing it in C may be a bit faster?
2014-11-04 17:57:23	crash_	i think it's beacuse the developer/s feels safer with python then C
2014-11-04 17:59:17	AidanCollier	Makes sense.
2014-11-04 18:00:34	crash_	:)
2014-11-04 18:04:24	<--	holmeslinux (~Holmes@187.36.131.247) has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2014-11-04 18:04:44	AidanCollier	Funny... it seems most every graphical installer is written in Python!
2014-11-04 18:04:51	crash_	yeah
2014-11-04 18:06:43	AidanCollier	Then I'd take it that libraries necessary for the installer are more accessible via Python, or something of the sort?
2014-11-04 18:08:26	AidanCollier	Never mind.
2014-11-04 18:09:30	crash_	i think so but i'm not sure
2014-11-04 18:09:31	AidanCollier	My other slight issue is that the Numix theme has odd borders formign around elements in a number of GTK applications, but I'm certain that's out of the question.
2014-11-04 18:09:56	crash_	i'm not that fond of the numix theme/s i like the standard theme
2014-11-04 18:10:05	AidanCollier	Adwaita?
2014-11-04 18:10:37	crash_	yes
2014-11-04 18:10:51	crash_	and zukowito for the shell
2014-11-04 18:11:11	AidanCollier	Somewhat the pre-numix Antergos?
2014-11-04 18:12:06	crash_	yep, i changed that to adwaita or the numix standard one not the circle or what they are called
2014-11-04 18:12:42	AidanCollier	Yes. I can't help but like the look of the numix frost theme though.
2014-11-04 18:13:39	AidanCollier	But the same oddities happened in multiple distros which I tried with numix and GNOME 3.14, so again, that's out of the question!
2014-11-04 18:14:11	AidanCollier	But I am having trouble with the GNOME printing program.
2014-11-04 18:17:20	AidanCollier	I'm certain I have CUPS and HPLIP installed, (as well as whatever else came with enabling the printer features in Cnchi), but it seems that the printing program doesn't recognize them. When I open it, I always seem to see 'Sorry! The system printing service doesn't seem to be available.' just above the frowning computer. I asked about this before, but reinstalling CUPS and HPLIP did nothing to help the issue.
2014-11-04 18:18:20	AidanCollier	Would you happen to have noticed this, or know how I can fix this issue?
2014-11-04 18:19:47	AidanCollier	? :/
2014-11-04 18:20:21	crash_	is are the systemctl services enabled?
2014-11-04 18:20:29	crash_	*all
2014-11-04 18:21:14	AidanCollier	I'd think so, but I'm not sure how to check, or what the names of the services are!
2014-11-04 18:22:01	AidanCollier	I do know 'sudo systemctl start' but then I don't know the particular service names for cups and hplip.
2014-11-04 18:24:03	crash_	sudo systemctl start cups or sudo systemctl start cups.service should do it
2014-11-04 18:25:09	AidanCollier	Here's what it outputs: Failed to start cups.service: Unit cups.service failed to load: No such file or directory.
2014-11-04 18:25:39	crash_	and just regular cups?
2014-11-04 18:26:08	AidanCollier	I tried entering entering regular 'cups' that time!
2014-11-04 18:26:38	AidanCollier	Adding the .service extension puts out he same result.
2014-11-04 18:26:58	crash_	or this cups-browsed.service
2014-11-04 18:27:36	AidanCollier	There it goes!
2014-11-04 18:27:53	crash_	nice
2014-11-04 18:28:29	AidanCollier	That helps a lot!
2014-11-04 18:28:57	crash_	:)

2014-11-05 12:54:50	monique	hey
2014-11-05 12:54:55	monique	does anyone use VLC?
2014-11-05 12:55:36	Noxbru	hi, no, mplayer user here
2014-11-05 12:57:30	monique	Noxbru: thank god..
2014-11-05 12:57:44	Noxbru	may I ask why?
2014-11-05 12:57:46	monique	can you reccommend me a frontend for mplayer ?
2014-11-05 12:57:54	Noxbru	I use gnome-mplayer
2014-11-05 12:58:15	Noxbru	but if you are in kde you can try smplayer
2014-11-05 12:59:31	monique	i get low frames
2014-11-05 12:59:33	monique	framerate
2014-11-05 12:59:37	monique	://
2014-11-05 12:59:59	Noxbru	not good... btw, didn't you ask something similar about youtube?
2014-11-05 13:00:06	monique	yep
2014-11-05 13:00:08	monique	i did
2014-11-05 13:00:20	monique	still same graphics card :/
2014-11-05 13:00:28	Noxbru	you know that you can use vdpau with mplayer too, don't you?
2014-11-05 13:01:18	monique	heh ?
2014-11-05 13:01:28	Noxbru	yes, maybe you can too with vlc
2014-11-05 13:01:29	monique	i dont know much about linux i suppose..
2014-11-05 13:01:35	monique	vlc has normal frame rate
2014-11-05 13:01:40	monique	mplayer has slow frame rate
2014-11-05 13:01:57	monique	but i dont use vlc because it cant show subtitles </3
2014-11-05 13:02:09	crash_	i'm using mpv :)
2014-11-05 13:02:17	Noxbru	if I remember correctly, it could show subtitles
2014-11-05 13:02:57	monique	i tried
2014-11-05 13:03:00	monique	12 subtitles
2014-11-05 13:03:05	monique	3 different extensions
2014-11-05 13:03:14	monique	on this particular movie, it cant display subtitles
2014-11-05 13:03:26	monique	lets try mpv
2014-11-05 13:03:36	Noxbru	that's curious, although I haven't used vlc in a long time
2014-11-05 13:04:30	Noxbru	mpv is built on top of mplayer, if you want, you can try to see if you can get better framerates from the terminal
2014-11-05 13:04:42	Noxbru	maybe something like 'mplayer -vo vdpau file'
2014-11-05 13:05:14	MichaelTunnell	i love mpv
2014-11-05 13:05:28	MichaelTunnell	not user friendly at times but it is awesome
2014-11-05 13:05:54	monique	thanks for MPV
2014-11-05 13:05:56	monique	fine rates
2014-11-05 13:05:59	monique	and subtitles work
2014-11-05 13:06:05	monique	thanks crash_  :)
2014-11-05 13:06:09	monique	thanks Noxbru and MichaelTunnell
2014-11-05 13:06:10	Noxbru	good to hear that
2014-11-05 13:06:17	monique	have a good night everyone :)

2014-11-06 06:06:31	spaceloop	hey, running antergos 2014.08.07, I would like to use Dash to dock, but the gnome tweak tool won't let me enable it "Extension does not support shell version"
2014-11-06 06:06:40	spaceloop	Any way how I can fix this?

2014-11-06 06:57:35	kieni	hi ... is there anybody who can read this?
2014-11-06 06:58:31	kieni	i am looking for help. I am searching a solution to boot vmware images / virtualbox images within Antergos installation.
2014-11-06 06:59:16	kieni	do I have to install vmware or virtualbox on Antergos, or can Antergos boot those images natively?
2014-11-06 07:01:20	fro_hun	i can read that, but no idea

2014-11-06 07:14:42	kieni	hi NuSuey
2014-11-06 07:14:48	kieni	may you can help me?
2014-11-06 07:15:35	kieni	I want to create a flexible host system + possibility to run Windows XP and Windows 7 (later Win8.1 + Win10)
2014-11-06 07:16:12	kieni	therfore i thought antergos is the right os for me, but .... how to install virtualbox properply on that system?
2014-11-06 07:20:13	NuSuey	uhm, you want to run windows systems on antergos?
2014-11-06 07:20:30	NuSuey	via virtualbox? or the other way around?
2014-11-06 07:32:46	kieni	i am trying to find a aolution for that
2014-11-06 07:33:35	kieni	first i thought antergos is a kind of virtualistion software, but now I am a bit lost. Does it makes sense to install virtualbox on antergos?

2014-11-06 08:31:11	mitfree	While Antergos is very flexible, it's not virtualizing software by default, kieni.

2014-11-06 08:37:24	kieni	thanks mitfree ... do you may have an idea how to use Antergos with virtualbox... Best way would be if the user does not recognize that he is using a vm. It should boot directly to that virtual maschine
2014-11-06 08:38:05	mitfree	sudo pacman -S virtualbox
2014-11-06 08:39:04	mitfree	I use it a few times a week to test linux applications.

2014-11-06 08:40:04	mitfree	I also use virtualbox-host-dkms and virtualbox-host-modules
2014-11-06 08:42:19	mitfree	it's pretty easy to set up the basics, but if you want to share the clipboard you'll need to rebuild the modules after each kernal update.
2014-11-06 08:43:00	mitfree	the wiki explains how to do this automaticly using virtualbox-hooks
2014-11-06 08:47:56	mitfree	"It should boot directly to that virtual  maschine
2014-11-06 08:48:36	mitfree	",  you say.. well that might not be a seamless experience
2014-11-06 08:50:30	mitfree	even if you add VB to the autostart of a lightweight WM like open box.. you get virtual box's landing page and you'll have to choise which image to open
2014-11-06 08:51:16	mitfree	you might be able to read through VB's docs to find a way to automate this or script it, but I haven't done it.
2014-11-06 08:51:46	mitfree	hope that helps, good luck

2014-11-08 17:24:26	vecchp	won't let me do a simple install from the ISO
2014-11-08 17:25:48	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: any files in particular because it iinstalled fine for me in my test box 2 weeks ago
2014-11-08 17:26:28	vecchp	the gui basically just says failed to install after it goes through downloading all the packages
2014-11-08 17:26:43	vecchp	i guess the cli installer would give me more information
2014-11-08 17:27:02	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: yes try that please so I can try to figure out a solution
2014-11-08 17:28:26	vecchp	That will require me to dowload all the packages again.  I guess i'll be back in 20 - 30 minutes

2014-11-08 17:30:30	Jubeh	open box and gnome installes for me though
2014-11-08 17:30:48	PenguinAnon	I just installed with Cinnamon today and everything worked fine.
2014-11-08 17:31:54	Jubeh	I had the kde problem on the last tow iso's
2014-11-08 17:32:32	Jubeh	on tow different compuers a PC and a laptop

2014-11-08 17:39:03	MichaelTunnell	I only ever tried gnome install
2014-11-08 17:39:07	MichaelTunnell	I should try the rest :)
2014-11-08 17:39:30	PenguinAnon	I used to run Gnome, but shifted to Cinnamon after I encountered a few issues.
2014-11-08 17:39:36	PenguinAnon	I've been thrilled ever since.
2014-11-08 17:42:40	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: I did the opposite. :) I really liked Cinnamon and then went to GNOME and love it more
2014-11-08 17:42:50	MichaelTunnell	although still a big fan of Cinnamon it is my 2nd fav
2014-11-08 17:43:19	PenguinAnon	Same here. Gnome is a great desktop.

2014-11-08 17:45:27	Jubeh	I'm using gnome for the first time since gnome 3 appeared and really I hate it.
2014-11-08 17:45:58	juliohm	I'm enjoying Gnome 3
2014-11-08 17:46:22	Jubeh	It's just different, I think it's not for me.
2014-11-08 17:46:37	juliohm	very clean and don't bother you with box messages
2014-11-08 17:47:00	juliohm	If you start using the Super key, you'll see it's very nice
2014-11-08 17:47:05	Jubeh	but, I'm taking it as a challenge to see how far can I go with it.
2014-11-08 17:47:09	juliohm	it's very efficient for me
2014-11-08 17:47:41	Jubeh	any advice's?
2014-11-08 17:48:19	juliohm	Jubeh, define shortcuts, press Super and type shortcuts
2014-11-08 17:48:35	juliohm	I have a shortcut for my browser, my terminal and my file browser
2014-11-08 17:48:45	Jubeh	mmmmmm
2014-11-08 17:48:46	juliohm	everything else I launch by pressing Super
2014-11-08 17:49:11	juliohm	Super and type whatever comes to mind
2014-11-08 17:49:44	Jubeh	keyboard driven
2014-11-08 17:49:55	juliohm	yeah
2014-11-08 17:50:00	Jubeh	I love my mouse :)
2014-11-08 17:50:09	juliohm	much more efficient for my kinds of activities
2014-11-08 17:50:15	juliohm	I don't like mouses :)
2014-11-08 17:52:01	Jubeh	I use the keyboard a lot but the gui was created to be controlled with a mouse.
2014-11-08 17:52:28	Jubeh	I have a dropdown terminal for my KB
2014-11-08 17:54:39	juliohm	It's really a matter of taste, I always try to avoid the mouse, it's simply too slow for me
2014-11-08 17:54:59	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh: you have to learn the workflow...if you are willing to change your workflow to fit GNOME then it is amazing
2014-11-08 17:55:13	MichaelTunnell	if you are not willing to try that then obviously it would not work for you
2014-11-08 17:55:18	MichaelTunnell	which is fine it isnt for everyone
2014-11-08 17:55:57	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh: set shortcuts to your workspaces
2014-11-08 17:56:21	MichaelTunnell	Mine = Super +1 (Wordspace 1) then Super + 2 (Workspace 2) and so on
2014-11-08 17:57:00	MichaelTunnell	the workspace thing I suggest for all distros and DEs though as it will work for all and is so awesome to have those shortcuts
2014-11-08 17:57:17	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh: also extensions are your friend... http://extensions.gnome.org
2014-11-08 17:58:13	MichaelTunnell	Auto Move Windows is AWESOME! You can activate it to put windows in specific workspaces so like my Quassel always loads on Workspace 4...same with Mumble and IMs (Pidgin)
2014-11-08 17:58:28	MichaelTunnell	then browsers are always on Workspace 1...VMs on Workspace 3 and so on
2014-11-08 17:59:17	juliohm	I never used Auto Move, but it may be great for some people that does lots of multitasking
2014-11-08 17:59:32	juliohm	I try to concentrate in one or two task at most
2014-11-08 17:59:42	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh & juliohm: I would also suggest using Quick Close Overview allows you to close windows with your scroll button click, anywhere on the window while in Overview mode...massive time saver
2014-11-08 17:59:43	juliohm	2 workspaces at most
2014-11-08 18:00:04	juliohm	I prefer Alt+F4 :)
2014-11-08 18:00:08	juliohm	or Ctrl+q
2014-11-08 18:00:32	MichaelTunnell	juliohm: doesnt work if the order of the apps is not in the order you want to close
2014-11-08 18:00:39	MichaelTunnell	I have 6 workspaces :)
2014-11-08 18:00:50	juliohm	good luck with 6 workspaces hahaha
2014-11-08 18:01:03	MichaelTunnell	Quick Close Overview does not work for 3.12 or 3.14 so I updated it to both and posted it here... http://michaeltunnell.com/blog/16-linux/52-my-updated-314-packages-for-gnome-extensions
2014-11-08 18:01:20	MichaelTunnell	juliohm: it works fantastically like I said earlier...they are all for specific purposes
2014-11-08 18:02:11	PenguinAnon	MichaelTunnell: I use workspaces like you do.
2014-11-08 18:02:29	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: perfect usage for them...otherwise what are they for? :)
2014-11-08 18:02:46	PenguinAnon	I'll use cinnamon's 1/4 window snap as well
2014-11-08 18:03:15	PenguinAnon	It makes it really easy to jump between email and our DDI controller at work, with a terminal or two available on every screen.
2014-11-08 18:05:02	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: I use Shell Shape in GNOME...it allows full window tiling inside of GNOME...it is like i3 + GNOME = glorious
2014-11-08 18:05:12	MichaelTunnell	GTile is great for basic tiling too
2014-11-08 18:06:16	PenguinAnon	I was using ShellShape when I was on Gnome. Two windows per workspace is just too few for me!
2014-11-08 18:08:37	Jubeh	since gnome 3 came out I've been on kde and with a task bar I rarely ever used worksspaces I really live in the browser.
2014-11-08 18:09:53	Jubeh	I think gnome 3 enforces the WSs
2014-11-08 18:10:36	PenguinAnon	I'm usually in a couple terminals. I have Infoblox open in a browser window, I'm SSHed into my work desktop, SSHed into my Cacti server, and a terminal on my local machine for network diagnostics.
2014-11-08 18:11:04	PenguinAnon	I'll put IRC, cmus, and a browser window with Pocketcasts Web on my other workspaces.
2014-11-08 18:11:44	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: what do you mean Shell Shape can do as many as you want...I can use 4
2014-11-08 18:12:27	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh: no you dont have to use them if you dont want to...you can even turn off the workspace dock if you want
2014-11-08 18:12:48	PenguinAnon	MichaelTunnell: I was just joking about Gnome's default of only offering 1/2 window snap.
2014-11-08 18:13:02	PenguinAnon	and how having two windows side by side isn't enough for me
2014-11-08 18:15:58	Jubeh	MichaelTunnell: it's just as I said gnome is different than what I'm used to It'll take time.
2014-11-08 18:18:22	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: yea that default is not enough for me
2014-11-08 18:18:29	MichaelTunnell	gtile solves that though
2014-11-08 18:19:15	MichaelTunnell	Jubeh: that makes sense...I didnt expect to like it and I forced myself to use it for 3 weeks and now I love it...first 3 days I was so annoyed by it but now...glorious

2014-11-08 18:54:14	MichaelTunnell	but hold on will get link
2014-11-08 18:54:45	msx	MichaelTunnell: nice :) pacman's repo line would be just fine.
2014-11-08 18:55:18	MichaelTunnell	msx: http://repo.antergos.com/antergos/

2014-11-08 18:55:32	MichaelTunnell	oh ok I can get that too if needed
2014-11-08 18:55:48	MichaelTunnell	Antergos repo also has great fonts
2014-11-08 18:56:37	msx	MichaelTunnell: I love the work guys have done with Antergos
2014-11-08 18:57:07	MichaelTunnell	msx: me too :)
2014-11-08 18:57:08	msx	If i weren't an Arch die-hard, I sure would go with Antergos
2014-11-08 18:57:27	msx	best thing: 100% compatible, not forking non-sense
2014-11-08 18:57:34	msx	*non
2014-11-08 18:57:35	MichaelTunnell	I used to be an Arch die hard until Antergos because I dont have to worry about the install effort
2014-11-08 18:57:52	MichaelTunnell	msx: exactly only reason I was excited about Antergos
2014-11-08 18:58:07	msx	absolutely, the installer is quite nice and let you setup a working system effortlessly in a snap!
2014-11-08 18:58:47	msx	MichaelTunnell: if you're into security, you should check BlackArch: same thing but headed towards pentesting, auditing and so on
2014-11-08 18:59:20	MichaelTunnell	my arch install borked like 4 years ago so I just said screw it and changed distros...then Antergos came out and I was so freaking excited to get back easily
2014-11-08 18:59:33	msx	lol
2014-11-08 18:59:54	msx	me too been down there the path of frustration xD
2014-11-08 19:00:16	msx	i recommend you check Btrfs
2014-11-08 19:00:23	MichaelTunnell	:) yea I couldnt justify the time needed for the install after the borking because I was too pissed off and then just stayed away
2014-11-08 19:00:35	msx	helps minimize 99.9999999% of glitches, issues, layer 8 problems
2014-11-08 19:00:46	MichaelTunnell	btrfs scares me with snapshot eating up space
2014-11-08 19:00:50	msx	LOL 'pissed off', so true
2014-11-08 19:01:06	MichaelTunnell	xfs is looking so good lately though...doesnt have everything that btrfs does but it does have a lot
2014-11-08 19:01:23	msx	but the snapshooting doesn't eat too much stuff
2014-11-08 19:01:32	-->	LanDi (~LOL@186.232.216.90) has joined #antergos
2014-11-08 19:01:49	msx	there's only one real snapshot, the first one, then the rest are diffed against it
2014-11-08 19:02:10	MichaelTunnell	it did for me...ate 20gbs but admittedly it was snapshotting more than it should have
2014-11-08 19:02:17	MichaelTunnell	I do like btrfs though
2014-11-08 19:02:59	MichaelTunnell	msx: I like BlackArch but I prefer ArchAssault because it works more like scripting on top of existing arch setup
2014-11-08 19:03:10	MichaelTunnell	so you can install Antergos and then install ArchAssault
2014-11-08 19:03:29	msx	i think one key step is to convert some key directories to a subvolume so they aren't snapshooted within the primary subvolume like, for example, /var/abs or /var/lib/pacman/pkg, etc. - and same with ~
2014-11-08 19:03:32	PenguinAnon	If I'm looking to chain bash commands in an alias, but only one of them would need sudo to work properly, how would I run sudo for just that one command?
2014-11-08 19:04:13	msx	MichaelTunnell: ah, AA, yes, didn't tried it yet but from what you say it works the same way than BA: you add the repo to your pacman.conf and then are ready to go
2014-11-08 19:04:28	msx	*that BA
2014-11-08 19:04:43	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: just pipe it
2014-11-08 19:04:54	PenguinAnon	*facepalms*
2014-11-08 19:05:13	PenguinAnon	Thank you
2014-11-08 19:05:20	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: welcome
2014-11-08 19:05:25	PenguinAnon	I've been working far too long today.
2014-11-08 19:05:39	msx	MichaelTunnell: before adding the repo, do I need to install any GPG key?
2014-11-08 19:07:11	MichaelTunnell	msx: there is a key with antergos-keyring but not sure if gpg or pgp
2014-11-08 19:07:35	MichaelTunnell	msx: I though BA was a separate distro...interesting
2014-11-08 19:08:03	MichaelTunnell	I mostly know about ArchAssault because I know the developer of it from a different channel so the only one I tested
2014-11-08 19:08:36	msx	ah I see it now, http://repo.antergos.com/antergos/x86_64/antergos-keyring-20140915-1-any.pkg.tar.xz, ty. Yes, you can install BA as an independent OS or as a layer on top your Arch install
2014-11-08 19:09:06	msx	MichaelTunnell: from what I know AA is a split from BA, but that's all my knowledge about the topic :P
2014-11-08 19:09:20	MichaelTunnell	msx: interesting...I'll take a look
2014-11-08 19:09:29	MichaelTunnell	ArchAssault is a much better name :)
2014-11-08 19:09:36	msx	lol
2014-11-08 19:09:49	msx	sounds like a Swat OS
2014-11-08 19:09:59	MichaelTunnell	which is why its cool :)
2014-11-08 19:10:00	msx	or more properly, S.W.A.T. OS
2014-11-08 19:10:16	MichaelTunnell	BlackArch could be racist :)
2014-11-08 19:10:24	msx	lol
2014-11-08 19:10:35	msx	nah! black in the sense of 'hackish'
2014-11-08 19:10:57	MichaelTunnell	I know but why hacking gotta be black?!?
2014-11-08 19:11:04	MichaelTunnell	why not DarkArch
2014-11-08 19:11:14	MichaelTunnell	:) just racist
2014-11-08 19:11:22	msx	OTOH I could imagine a NiggaArch flavor for the
2014-11-08 19:11:28	msx	neighborhood bros!
2014-11-08 19:11:49	MichaelTunnell	msx: lol take off one of the a's
2014-11-08 19:11:55	MichaelTunnell	I feel bad about that now
2014-11-08 19:11:59	MichaelTunnell	nevermind
2014-11-08 19:12:05	msx	black is just a color man
2014-11-08 19:12:16	MichaelTunnell	I know I am joking...of course it isnt racist

2014-11-09 06:08:12	PenguinAnon	I upgraded fakeroot and libffi this morning, but I doubt that was the cause.
2014-11-09 06:09:28	Noxbru	you can try to restart the service and see if afterwards still does the same
2014-11-09 06:09:33	Noxbru	sudo systemctl restart ntpd.service
2014-11-09 06:09:41	Noxbru	and you can ask for its status
2014-11-09 06:12:28	PenguinAnon	Thanks, Noxbru. That was the first thing I tried.
2014-11-09 06:12:39	PenguinAnon	Running ntpd -q told me "unable to bind to wildcard address :: - another process may be running - EXITING"
2014-11-09 06:13:04	Noxbru	have you checked against which servers it's trying to sync?
2014-11-09 06:13:24	PenguinAnon	That's where I was headed next.
2014-11-09 06:13:31	PenguinAnon	Where is that config located?

2014-11-09 06:15:56	PenguinAnon	It doesn't have iburst enabled. I'll try that
2014-11-09 06:16:26	Noxbru	I am using the same servers
2014-11-09 06:24:04	PenguinAnon	Hmm. I'll disable the service for now and diagnose later today.

2014-11-09 08:35:05	AidanCollier	I believe I had found a major bug in the live media.
2014-11-09 08:36:02	AidanCollier	Even when the website seems to have the august snapshot still up, the iso I downloaded from it as of today only has cnchi-dev installed, and not the stable release of cnchi.
2014-11-09 08:36:43	AidanCollier	Plus, Cnchi-dev seems to always fail the installation process!
2014-11-09 08:37:26	Noxbru	cnchi changes when necessity arises, it is pretty hard to keep it stable if some packages change
2014-11-09 08:37:44	Noxbru	you mean cnchi-dev as the latest version from git, don't you?
2014-11-09 08:38:01	AidanCollier	Yes.
2014-11-09 08:38:57	Noxbru	then, could you please add an issue to the git repo?
2014-11-09 08:39:10	AidanCollier	But I thought that the august snapshot had the non-dev Cnchi version 0.6.6 without the 'this is prerelease software' markup.
2014-11-09 08:39:26	AidanCollier	Noxbru: And sure, I can add the issue!
2014-11-09 08:39:53	AidanCollier	/:)
2014-11-09 08:40:01	Noxbru	I don't know what the august snapshot had, but still, it's better to always use cnchi-dev
2014-11-09 08:40:07	Noxbru	thanks :)
2014-11-09 08:40:50	AidanCollier	I actually did try Cnchi-dev before, but it never had the ERROR message pop up, oddly enough!
2014-11-09 08:41:20	AidanCollier	I tried the installer on other computers as well, and the same error came up.
2014-11-09 08:41:58	AidanCollier	So I bet that reporting the issue on Cnchi's side would only be appropriate.
2014-11-09 08:42:04	MichaelTunnell	I have never had an issue with cnchi dev or not so not sure what you are experiencing but git issues please
2014-11-09 08:42:47	AidanCollier	Me neither! I just hope the error could be fixed soon!
2014-11-09 08:42:59	Noxbru	yes, and besides, better to have the github issue that some lost logs from the IRC ;)
2014-11-09 08:44:04	AidanCollier	Of course!

2014-11-09 23:10:23	xeriouth	I'm having a problem getting to the login screen when I boot up Antergos or log out to make changes. It was fine for the first few times, but it just started happening today that whenever I got to the login screen, it's just a black background and my mouse pointer. Will I have to reinstall the install?
2014-11-09 23:14:23	MichaelTunnell	xeriouth: you need to ask on the forum as I am not sure

2014-11-10 07:34:13	PenguinAnon	A small one. When using window snap, Evince leaves a small (maybe 1/2 a centimetre) space around the window.
2014-11-10 07:34:43	PenguinAnon	Right-clicking in that area with nothing behind it gives you the right-click menu from the desktop
2014-11-10 07:35:01	PenguinAnon	This might be a CSD issue.

2014-11-10 07:48:49	PenguinAnon	Well, I know it isn't just Evince
2014-11-10 07:49:26	PenguinAnon	GEdit demonstrates the same behavior
2014-11-10 07:49:47	Noxbru	maybe related to window decorations? the theme?
2014-11-10 07:51:30	PenguinAnon	I'm just running the default Numix Frost Light.
2014-11-10 07:52:20	PenguinAnon	And both Evince and GEdit use CSDs. That's the only differentiating factor I can see.

2014-11-11 07:52:30	MichaelTunnell	they deserve it so I'm ok with that
2014-11-11 07:52:36	PenguinAnon	Geniuinely curious here, what is the objection to Manjero?
2014-11-11 07:52:45	PenguinAnon	I've never used it.
2014-11-11 07:53:03	MichaelTunnell	http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/24bdh8/what_does_rlinux_think_of_manjaro/ch5tuot
2014-11-11 07:53:34	MichaelTunnell	plus the fact that they steal code...take credit for other people's hard work...as far as to even remove existing credit of the original developers
2014-11-11 07:54:08	PenguinAnon	0.o That comment...
2014-11-11 07:55:22	MichaelTunnell	that comment?
2014-11-11 07:55:53	PenguinAnon	The reddit comment you linked.
2014-11-11 07:56:15	PenguinAnon	That's just crazy. I had not heard anything about that Windows/OSX nonsense.
2014-11-11 07:56:17	MichaelTunnell	yea but why O.o?
2014-11-11 07:56:32	PenguinAnon	I'm amazed that a Linux distro is making those sorts of decisions is all.
2014-11-11 07:56:51	MichaelTunnell	I was wondering if you had seen it before or just reacting for the first time to it
2014-11-11 07:56:53	Aethysius	They need to put down the crack pipe.
2014-11-11 07:57:04	PenguinAnon	Reacting for the first time.
2014-11-11 07:57:16	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: ahh ok...well I made the comment btw :)
2014-11-11 07:57:39	PenguinAnon	I knew Manjero was Arch based, and had AUR access out of the box, but that was the extent of my familiarity.
2014-11-11 07:57:42	MichaelTunnell	yea that windows osx thing was incredibly stupid
2014-11-11 07:58:09	PenguinAnon	Matt from the Linux Action Show mentioned occasionally that he had it on a couple boxes, but I never tried it out.
2014-11-11 07:58:24	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: it is and kind of isnt...they change a LOT of stuff including the kernel so the AUR packages can easily break manjaro because you know...they werent made for manjaro
2014-11-11 07:58:44	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: him mentioning it is why I looked into it...and then found all this horrible crap
2014-11-11 07:58:46	PenguinAnon	No wonder the Arch guys hate Manjero questions in the forums.
2014-11-11 07:59:10	PenguinAnon	Do you have any information on the kernel modifications they make? I'm curious.
2014-11-11 07:59:24	MichaelTunnell	I told him about it and he said "I dont use Manjaro anymore except for spare computers that I dont care about keeping updated"
2014-11-11 07:59:28	MichaelTunnell	or something like that

2014-11-11 07:59:50	MichaelTunnell	no but there was an interview on LAS where one of the devs explained the difference
2014-11-11 08:00:14	PenguinAnon	Ok, I'll search around. Thanks =)
2014-11-11 08:00:43	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: it has nothing to do with that actually...it is stupid in the first place to ask people to fix something they have nothing to do with. It would be like asking Ubuntu devs to help with Mint and Debian devs to help with Ubuntu...it isnt what they work on...how should they know
2014-11-11 08:01:52	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro being a giant piece of garbage from a theif is not relevant to why Arch devs/maintainers/etc dont want to help Manjaro users...the fact that they dont have anything to do with Manjaro is why
2014-11-11 08:02:33	MichaelTunnell	if Manjaro itself and the jerk who runs it wasnt enough...they create a community of jackasses who hate Arch users for not helping them when it is stupid for them to ask in the first place.
2014-11-11 08:03:40	MichaelTunnell	I stopped going to #archlinux because people started cursing at me consistently for not helping with Manjaro issues. It is just pathetic that they are jackasses in the first place but to blame me for someone else's terrible code...that is unacceptable
2014-11-11 08:05:09	PenguinAnon	I can't blame you for that at all.
2014-11-11 08:08:27	MichaelTunnell	:)
2014-11-11 08:09:04	MichaelTunnell	this is why I like Antergos...it is fully compatible with Arch in every way so issues with Antergos are really issues with Arch and thus if I find an issue with Antergos and can move it up the chain to Arch which I have done many times
2014-11-11 08:10:03	qdata	I tentatively looked at #archlinux briefly - what I experienced was a collection od arrested-development 12 yr olds and everything I had a question or complaint about was "pebkac" related
2014-11-11 08:10:14	MichaelTunnell	and when I make tutorials for Antergos they are compatible with Arch and can go into the Arch Wiki...that is great to me...I get to help with two distros at the same time

2014-11-11 08:10:38	Aethysius	The Arch Way can be summed up to RTFM.
2014-11-11 08:11:05	MichaelTunnell	qdata: the people who were nice got sick of the assholes and thus are gone from the channel leaving the jerks to deal with jerks
2014-11-11 08:11:14	qdata	I've been around computers since punch card days and it's just insulting
2014-11-11 08:11:28	MichaelTunnell	I occasionally go back in to bring some rationality to it but it is rare these days
2014-11-11 08:11:32	PenguinAnon	MichaelTunnell: Agreed. It was actually the community that kept me from trying Arch, and not the technical challenge.
2014-11-11 08:11:51	MichaelTunnell	Aethysius: actually no but that is part of it certainly

2014-11-11 08:12:02	PenguinAnon	I switched to Antergos because it gave me a way to test Arch and have a community where I knew I would be welcome, even if I had newbie questions.
2014-11-11 08:12:04	Aethysius	I was being sarcastic.

2014-11-11 08:14:04	MichaelTunnell	Aethysius: I get that but some people genuinely believe that...very hard to tell the difference these days :)
2014-11-11 08:14:20	Aethysius	True.
2014-11-11 08:16:42	MichaelTunnell	I disagree with some of the Antergos approach but very little so that is why I use it
2014-11-11 08:16:53	MichaelTunnell	it is rare to find a distro you can agree with 100% lol
2014-11-11 08:17:15	Aethysius	Unless you LFS.
2014-11-11 08:17:55	Aethysius	I'm considering one day using SourceMage.
2014-11-11 08:22:36	MichaelTunnell	LFS isnt a distro :)
2014-11-11 08:24:22	Aethysius	I know.

2014-11-11 21:01:04	vecchp	hmmmm it seems that I can't update any atergos packages
2014-11-11 21:01:09	vecchp	I get error: numix-icon-theme: signature from "Antergos Build Server (Automated Package Build System) <admin@antergos.org>" is marginal trust :: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/numix-icon-theme-0.r229.634c1c1-1-any.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
2014-11-11 21:01:22	vecchp	this was also a problem i was having during the install as well
2014-11-11 21:03:56	mitfree	vecchp: Pacman 4.0 introduced package signing. While it's great for security it can be a little anoiying at times.
2014-11-11 21:04:17	vecchp	mitfree: so how do i get this to go away/fix it
2014-11-11 21:04:52	mitfree	is this a fresh install?
2014-11-11 21:05:53	vecchp	mitfree: yes
2014-11-11 21:06:06	vecchp	mitfree: i had so many issues with this current install
2014-11-11 21:06:14	vecchp	mitfree: never had any problems in the past
2014-11-11 21:06:38	mitfree	Interesting, is this the August iso?
2014-11-11 21:06:49	vecchp	mitfree: like first i couldn't even install gnome cause it would just say "couldn't install necessary packages" or something of that sort.  had to install an update to cnchi.
2014-11-11 21:07:05	vecchp	mitfree: it is the latest one on the site
2014-11-11 21:07:27	vecchp	mitfree: says 08 so i assume it is the august one
2014-11-11 21:09:26	mitfree	isn't there a pacman command you need to run first to get everything working right
2014-11-11 21:09:45	mitfree	pacman init.. or something like that
2014-11-11 21:09:53	vecchp	mitfree: uh no idea
2014-11-11 21:10:12	MichaelTunnell	vecchp: have you read the antergos-keyring fix?
2014-11-11 21:10:46	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: no i'm not sure where that is
2014-11-11 21:10:49	juliohm	Did you tried to update flash for chromium from AUR?
2014-11-11 21:10:55	juliohm	Did you try*
2014-11-11 21:11:14	MichaelTunnell	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2419&p=11392&hilit=keyring#p11392
2014-11-11 21:11:17	juliohm	I see some comments saying it's broken, I'm afraid to update
2014-11-11 21:11:52	MichaelTunnell	this should solve it...I need to go but try that
2014-11-11 21:12:13	mitfree	pacman-key that's it
2014-11-11 21:12:39	vecchp	MichaelTunnell: didn't seem to do anything but alright
2014-11-11 21:13:50	mitfree	Now try sudo pacman -Syu
2014-11-11 21:14:59	vecchp	mitfree: nope doesn't work
2014-11-11 21:15:28	vecchp	same error
2014-11-11 21:15:34	mitfree	did you run the whole: sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux antergos
2014-11-11 21:15:56	vecchp	mitfree: yes
2014-11-11 21:16:15	mitfree	try pacman-key --init
2014-11-11 21:16:51	mitfree	unless you already did that
2014-11-11 21:17:02	mitfree	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman-key
2014-11-11 21:17:04	vecchp	mitfree: did it again and nothing
2014-11-11 21:17:37	mitfree	you can try pacman-key --refresh-keys
2014-11-11 21:18:42	vecchp	mitfree: just did that too and it didn't work
2014-11-11 21:21:49	mitfree	You know it could be a real problem with the numix-icon-theme key... and pacman could be doing just what it should do..
2014-11-11 21:21:55	mitfree	Do you really need numix-icon-theme?
2014-11-11 21:22:20	vecchp	mitfree: Do i really need it? no.  But i would like a default installation of antergos to just work lol
2014-11-11 21:22:53	vecchp	mitfree: seems like i'm also having issues with other packages as well like when i try to get playonlinux it just says it can't resolve the deps
2014-11-11 21:23:04	mitfree	OK, than, I'll let someone else chim in.. I can think of a few work arounds. Ping me if you need me.
2014-11-11 21:24:10	vecchp	mitfree: yah
2014-11-11 21:27:23	mitfree	Is your system clock correct?
2014-11-11 21:28:02	mitfree	Pacman-key depends on time.

2014-11-13 07:47:55	MichaelTunnell	I was going to suggest forcing the package from the repo and then trying Syu again

2014-11-13 07:49:47	bigl0af	MichaelTunnell: got it whipped :)
2014-11-13 07:49:58	bigl0af	basically, i was doing a full update via yaourt
2014-11-13 07:50:06	bigl0af	"yaourt -Sauy --noconfirm"
2014-11-13 07:50:16	bigl0af	it's been abt a week since last full update...
2014-11-13 07:50:31	bigl0af	since then, one pkg that's been upgraded was antergos-keyring
2014-11-13 07:51:10	bigl0af	so i did a manual update of just that package first, applied the keyring fix as detailed by your link, ran yaourt full sys upgrade again and w00p - working!
2014-11-13 07:51:36	bigl0af	but yea thx for the help MichaelTunnell - really appreciate it!
2014-11-13 07:51:48	MichaelTunnell	bigl0af: yea the second fix I sent you was meant to manually update that one package :)
2014-11-13 07:52:07	MichaelTunnell	dont use Yaourt for pacman updates
2014-11-13 07:52:10	MichaelTunnell	use Pacman
2014-11-13 07:52:59	bigl0af	i'm surprised whomever maintains pacman hasn't pulled in code from yaourt for AUR support directly w/ pacman
2014-11-13 07:53:01	MichaelTunnell	yaourt is not that good of a tool...pacman is much more reliable. Pacman for official repos and Yaourt for AUR is my suggested approach
2014-11-13 07:53:16	MichaelTunnell	bigl0af: that defeats the point of the AUR entirely
2014-11-13 07:53:34	MichaelTunnell	Pacman will never have access to the AUR because that defeats the point of their separation
2014-11-13 07:53:53	bigl0af	MichaelTunnell: does it? i look @ aur sort of like centos base chan vs epel...AUR == epel
2014-11-13 07:53:59	bigl0af	"use at your own risk" kind of thing
2014-11-13 07:54:14	bigl0af	but from the pkg mgmt tool perspective, it's just a pkg source
2014-11-13 07:54:35	MichaelTunnell	it isnt just that though
2014-11-13 07:55:28	MichaelTunnell	Pacman is packages from official repos meaning tested sure but also officially maintained by someone. The AUR could be heavily tested but packages that wont become official and thus not likely to be added to pacman ever
2014-11-13 07:55:49	MichaelTunnell	the point of the separation is so that people dont INSTANTLY get access to experimental packages.
2014-11-13 07:56:37	MichaelTunnell	essentially you have to "earn" the access by learning how to use PKGBUILDs and typically these builds are taught in the context of building an AUR Helper such as Yaourt
2014-11-13 07:56:58	bigl0af	MichaelTunnell: so why have AUR at all - fetch src from git directly...it'd be REALLY separated then right? :P
2014-11-13 07:57:16	MichaelTunnell	so essentially the point is if you want experimental packages you need to prove that you can handle the act of them being experimental thus the separation and need for building a Helper
2014-11-13 07:57:33	bigl0af	MichaelTunnell: i think i see what you're saying tho

2014-11-13 07:57:45	bigl0af	it's a package-maintainer proving ground of sorts
2014-11-13 07:57:46	MichaelTunnell	the separation is not the point of it entirely
2014-11-13 07:57:53	MichaelTunnell	bigl0af: basically yes
2014-11-13 07:58:15	MichaelTunnell	the separation is to make sure people using it are able to use it properly without screwing themselves
2014-11-13 07:59:05	MichaelTunnell	the arent exactly separated as the AUR Helpers provide pacman like control and even package management via pacman in order to keep your packages organized, searchable, interact with dependencies, etc
2014-11-13 07:59:29	MichaelTunnell	without the AUR Helper style the package management features wouldnt work...like directly to git would not provide any of that
2014-11-13 07:59:40	MichaelTunnell	that is why the AUR exists to keep it all organized
2014-11-13 08:00:11	MichaelTunnell	the separation exists to ensure that people who aren't comfortable with experimental cant accidentally use experimental packages
2014-11-13 08:01:31	MichaelTunnell	it is kind of a way to say "in Arch you can use pretty much any package you want...but in some cases you need to show you can handle using some of these packages"
2014-11-13 08:01:49	MichaelTunnell	more of a deterent for people who have no intention of learning how Arch works
2014-11-13 08:02:21	MichaelTunnell	I am a big fan of Antergos but this is one thing that I dont like about it....easy access to the AUR
2014-11-13 08:02:43	MichaelTunnell	the only reason I am somewhat ok with it is that Antergos does warn people quite heavily that it is all experimental
2014-11-13 08:03:20	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro on the otherhand does give a crap about their users to warn them with any significant warnings
2014-11-13 08:03:30	MichaelTunnell	does not give*

2014-11-13 10:45:33	Noxbru	haha, depends who you ask
2014-11-13 10:45:40	Noxbru	but it's easy
2014-11-13 10:45:54	Noxbru	Antergos = Arch + installer, basic configuration and few packages
2014-11-13 10:46:08	Noxbru	Manjaro = Selected Arch/AUR packages
2014-11-13 10:46:21	Noxbru	where selected means that they choose which packages and which versions
2014-11-13 10:47:18	anter	Well I wanted to try Arch, but the install seems difficult.
2014-11-13 10:47:43	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro is also not compatible with Arch repos including the AUR so some things in the AUR will not build correctly in Manjaro because they were not made for Manjaro
2014-11-13 10:47:53	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is fully compatible with Arch repos and the AUR
2014-11-13 10:48:32	MichaelTunnell	even bypassing the arch install will not bypass learning the "Arch Way"
2014-11-13 10:48:39	anter	What is AUR? is that like Debian contrib?
2014-11-13 10:48:44	MichaelTunnell	you will still need to learn pacman, how the aur works etc
2014-11-13 10:48:55	MichaelTunnell	anter: not really
2014-11-13 10:48:55	Noxbru	AUR = Arch User Repository
2014-11-13 10:49:24	anter	AUR - like user contributed packages?
2014-11-13 10:49:26	MichaelTunnell	AUR is kind of like a gigantic PPA but the content of the ppa is controlled by various people that are unrelated to each other
2014-11-13 10:49:38	Noxbru	it's a very cool thing, but it is also a big responsibility
2014-11-13 10:49:39	MichaelTunnell	anter: yes kind of
2014-11-13 10:50:52	anter	How often do packages break from updates?
2014-11-13 10:51:03	superbia	often
2014-11-13 10:51:07	Noxbru	depends, stable, not very often (hardly ever)
2014-11-13 10:51:26	superbia	often is once every six months
2014-11-13 10:51:42	Noxbru	then often (2 in a year)
2014-11-13 10:51:54	superbia	but can be avoided by reading rss, irc, or arch update something
2014-11-13 10:52:08	Noxbru	although, for me often means once a week
2014-11-13 10:52:27	anter	Once a week? Ugh.
2014-11-13 10:52:59	Noxbru	given how often the packages are updated? once a week would be often, yes :)
2014-11-13 10:53:55	anter	Could an Antergos install be converted to Arch later?
2014-11-13 10:54:13	Noxbru	sure, just remove antergos related packages, and the antergos repo
2014-11-13 10:55:08	anter	What you miss about other distributions?
2014-11-13 10:55:19	Noxbru	nothing?
2014-11-13 10:56:24	anter	How did you decide to use Antergos instead of Arch?
2014-11-13 10:57:24	superbia	antergos is arch
2014-11-13 10:57:30	Noxbru	cinnarch
2014-11-13 10:57:30	superbia	just with 1 more side repo
2014-11-13 10:58:46	superbia	i would defineteley suggest you install arch (learn the basic install, and if you fail, install antergos)
2014-11-13 10:58:59	superbia	doesnt hurt to learn something new, doesnt it?
2014-11-13 10:59:01	Noxbru	you can also try in a VM
2014-11-13 10:59:09	Noxbru	that's what I did
2014-11-13 10:59:24	anter	How is the wireless support?  Is it likely to be able to install by wireless, or do I have to hunt down a wired connection?
2014-11-13 10:59:44	superbia	its easy either in antergos or arch
2014-11-13 11:02:07	anter	I did download and burn Arch to a dvd, but then, with no installer, no networking, and no access to the Arch website, I was stuck not being able to do the install.
2014-11-13 11:02:27	superbia	well
2014-11-13 11:02:37	superbia	that is why you write the installation commands on a piece of paper
2014-11-13 11:02:44	superbia	still
2014-11-13 11:02:49	Noxbru	or you check them with your phone
2014-11-13 11:02:52	superbia	you can browse the web on the dvd..
2014-11-13 11:03:03	superbia	with w3m or lynx
2014-11-13 11:03:17	Noxbru	superbia: if you can't get network you can't
2014-11-13 11:03:42	superbia	sudo wifi-menu works everywhere
2014-11-13 11:04:16	superbia	trust me... i tried from newest asus laptops, from IBM a31p, to deluxe asus motherboards (the first motherboards with integrated wifis)
2014-11-13 11:04:22	Noxbru	if you remember or if you know that you can use it
2014-11-13 11:04:24	superbia	wifi-menu worked everywhere
2014-11-13 11:05:06	<--	qdata (qbit@unaffiliated/qdata) has left #antergos ("Returning to Unamatrix0:0")
2014-11-13 11:05:08	anter	The wireless didn't work and I didn't have  a wrired connection, but that was a while back, can't remember the details now.
2014-11-13 11:06:43	superbia	anter: do you have a printer ?

2014-11-13 11:08:01	anter	No, then I could print out the install instructions. That would be too easy  :)
2014-11-13 11:08:46	zra	haha antergos made things waaay easier for me
2014-11-13 11:09:34	zra	I have no idea if I opted for the right desktop enviroment, but xfce seems decent
2014-11-13 11:09:42	anter	Show-stopper question:  is GnuCash in the antegros or arch repositories?
2014-11-13 11:10:13	Noxbru	zra there's no 'right' desktop environment, there's ones  you like more and ones you like less;)
2014-11-13 11:10:32	Noxbru	anter: no problem with gnucash, is in <extra>
2014-11-13 11:10:43	zra	=P I know, but I meant "right" for me, you know ;)
2014-11-13 11:10:56	Noxbru	haha, testing testing testing then
2014-11-13 11:11:17	MichaelTunnell	zra: you should try MATE...I actually hate XFCE but MATE is awesome although I dont use either
2014-11-13 11:11:23	zra	I love simplicity and customization, xfce had the closest description =P
2014-11-13 11:12:05	anter	Is "extra" from arch or antergos?
2014-11-13 11:12:09	Noxbru	arch
2014-11-13 11:12:12	zra	MichaelTunnell: will check it out as soon as I figure out how to switch between the two =P
2014-11-13 11:12:16	MichaelTunnell	MATE has both of those
2014-11-13 11:13:46	zra	I knew nothing about linux till I decided to switch from windows 2/3 days ago =P seems like it will take quite a while
2014-11-13 11:14:15	Noxbru	zra: not sure about starting with Arch related distros...
2014-11-13 11:14:22	anter	Well, maybe I will give Antergos a try, as soon as I can find the time.  Thanks for the info, you guys have been way cool, unlike some other distro channels/forums.  Thanks.
2014-11-13 11:14:46	superbia	do you have pen and paper?
2014-11-13 11:14:59	superbia	i have my own "guide with basic steps"
2014-11-13 11:15:25	zra	=P arch has the best looking distro to me, I really really do not mind learning ;)
2014-11-13 11:15:42	anter	Okay, ready.
2014-11-13 11:15:43	Noxbru	then, welcome :)
2014-11-13 11:15:55	superbia	anter: you want my instructions then ?
2014-11-13 11:16:03	anter	Sure.
2014-11-13 11:16:11	superbia	wht gpu do you have
2014-11-13 11:16:17	superbia	do you have a clean Hard disk
2014-11-13 11:16:22	superbia	do you want encryption?
2014-11-13 11:16:45	zra	Noxbru: thank you, =) hopefully I will be able to contribute to things like kernels after some years of going all out =P
2014-11-13 11:17:22	Noxbru	zra six years it has taken to me to start contributing, so don't worry if you need your time :)
2014-11-13 11:17:43	anter	1- I can add encryption later. 2 - No clean disk now, will have to do that. 3 - What is a gpu? same as a cpu?
2014-11-13 11:17:58	superbia	anter: gpu is graphics
2014-11-13 11:18:23	superbia	anter: first, i would suggest you use antergos :) find out how pacman works, find out if you have working internet there
2014-11-13 11:18:33	superbia	anter: ok?
2014-11-13 11:18:40	anter	Just a basic i686 laptop with built-in Intel graphics.
2014-11-13 11:18:54	superbia	then most stuff should work.. but meh
2014-11-13 11:18:59	superbia	just install antergos..
2014-11-13 11:19:13	superbia	you will atleast get familiar with how arch works
2014-11-13 11:19:25	superbia	and when u are familiar with arch, you can install it in 5 minutes
2014-11-13 11:20:11	zra	=P my typing has actually already started becoming better because of this journey
2014-11-13 11:20:14	anter	Internet is fine, is pacman hard to use?  Seems like it should be simple enough.
2014-11-13 11:21:17	Noxbru	for most of all I guess that it has, also, better english as an extra :)
2014-11-13 11:23:01	anter	Well, gotta go for now.  Again, thanks for the info.

2014-11-13 12:32:15	Noxbru	with the man pages
2014-11-13 12:32:19	Noxbru	gentoo wiki sometimes
2014-11-13 12:32:24	Noxbru	the forums
2014-11-13 12:39:16	zra	thanks Noxbru =)
2014-11-13 12:39:33	Noxbru	you are welcome :)
2014-11-13 12:39:44	Noxbru	you know, you can ask here too ;)
2014-11-13 12:45:34	zra	Well I could, but, it would probably be too much. I would like to be able to boot to ram, each boot(think that is possible =P, have lots of ram). Still need to figure out, what would be an efficient way. To ensure my drivers and updates are always good. And what would be the best overall workspace for me.
2014-11-13 12:52:06	jarecot	Hi guys, anyone knows about a software for radio broadcasting that can be used in antergos? I know that exists some but just for Debian and Ubuntu. Thanks in advance!

2014-11-13 12:58:46	jarecot	MichaelTunnell: Airtime for example but I read in a forum that just works in Debian distros.
2014-11-13 13:01:53	jarecot	I moved recently from Win and I used Sam broadcaster, I have a radio station online but want just open source soft in my Antergos :P

2014-11-14 23:20:06	gabmus__	hello everyone. i'd want to buy an hp pavilion 15, the one with the i3 and the blue chassis if you know it. anyway, when trying to boot antergos from my liveusb (made using dd), it gets to the "grub like" menu where you have to choose whether to boot antergos or to get into an uefi shell. if i choose to boot antergos, the pc reboots and gets back to the same screen. how do i get around this?
2014-11-14 23:21:46	MichaelTunnell	gabmus__: do you have secure boot enabled in your BIOS?
2014-11-14 23:21:56	gabmus__	i disabled it
2014-11-14 23:22:39	gabmus__	also, mind that this pc isn't mine, the shop guy let me try the live usb yesterday before i decide to buy it
2014-11-14 23:23:50	MichaelTunnell	I dont remember what my install was like because it was so long ago, so I'm not sure what needs to be done now.
2014-11-14 23:24:17	MichaelTunnell	this sounds like something you need to ask for help on the Forum for, so the Antergos devs can see it
2014-11-14 23:26:45	gabmus__	i dont know if i have the time to, thats the point, that's why i asked here. i rather would have asked on #archlinux really but this looks like a more specific problem. new question: if i get to boot pure arch, then it means it's possible to boot antergos and the thing that i experienced is just an annoying bug, right? because i could think of making a live arch

2014-11-14 23:28:25	MichaelTunnell	there really isnt such a thing as live arch...there isnt a live iso for arch, just an install iso
2014-11-14 23:28:37	MichaelTunnell	it is also very complex of an install
2014-11-14 23:28:43	MichaelTunnell	are you familiar with linux?
2014-11-14 23:30:51	gabmus__	i tried to install arch once, i almost made it. yes, by live arch i mean running the install iso. it's kinda like a live after all, at least for my testing purpose, right?
2014-11-14 23:31:18	gabmus__	and yes, im familiar with linux
2014-11-14 23:31:29	gabmus__	brb
2014-11-14 23:34:17	MichaelTunnell	no it isnt like a live pretty much at all

2014-11-15 02:45:05	ante_	yeah, thats my problem, no information :D
2014-11-15 02:45:39	MichaelTiebesl	did you check the forum of arch?
2014-11-15 02:45:50	ante_	nope
2014-11-15 02:46:13	ante_	but i know arch supports it
2014-11-15 02:47:01	Noxbru	ah, well, Antergos didn't support Secure Boot as of 5th november

2014-11-15 02:53:04	Noxbru	you are welcome
2014-11-15 02:58:15	ante_	i've got another question : i am looking forward to dual boot my windows 8 uefi (gpt) system with antergos i've already shrunk my windows partition so that i have 80gb of unallocated space, my plan so far is to disable fastboot and secure boot then boot antergos and at the point of the diskmanagement i will add a swap partition and a / partition and will mount my windows 8 efi partition as /boot
2014-11-15 02:58:24	ante_	will this work?
2014-11-15 02:58:45	Noxbru	no idea, honestly
2014-11-15 02:58:59	ante_	:)7

2014-11-15 05:31:22	superbia	Noxbru: thinking about installing arch..
2014-11-15 05:31:33	Noxbru	think again ;)
2014-11-15 05:31:35	superbia	Noxbru: this machine only has 2GB ram, which is kinky for windows
2014-11-15 05:32:04	Noxbru	unless you have a piece of paper, you read carefully the installation guide for newbies and you have patience
2014-11-15 05:32:29	Noxbru	then, think again, try in a VM and when you understand more or less how it goes, try it
2014-11-15 05:33:20	superbia	i had arch
2014-11-15 05:33:24	superbia	installed 20 times
2014-11-15 05:33:29	superbia	but with time you get lazy
2014-11-15 05:33:36	superbia	and luks changed in the meantime
2014-11-15 05:33:44	superbia	so that would be the thing id have to look

2014-11-15 05:35:11	superbia	since i run ratpoison
2014-11-15 05:35:15	superbia	and all cli apps
2014-11-15 05:35:35	Noxbru	that's also what I would install, even if I end with something like antergos-gnome
2014-11-15 05:35:59	superbia	talking about gnome
2014-11-15 05:36:08	superbia	what is good for a 2GB system
2014-11-15 05:37:10	superbia	there are times when you dont use the keyboard
2014-11-15 05:37:13	superbia	such as eating dinner
2014-11-15 05:37:19	superbia	and then you only have one hand to navigate
2014-11-15 05:37:25	superbia	and would be nice to have somekind of a gui
2014-11-15 05:37:27	superbia	:)
2014-11-15 05:38:12	Noxbru	jaja, w3m then ;)
2014-11-15 05:38:37	superbia	lynx
2014-11-15 05:38:59	superbia	gnome or KDE
2014-11-15 05:39:19	superbia	i need to checke
2014-11-15 05:39:21	superbia	check
2014-11-15 05:39:27	Noxbru	I like gnome, when I tried kde I found it... overcustomizable
2014-11-15 05:39:38	superbia	when you start gnome
2014-11-15 05:39:45	superbia	it starts gnome-shit also ?
2014-11-15 05:39:49	superbia	or just gnome
2014-11-15 05:41:00	superbia	i have the possibility to open gnome from the ratpoison
2014-11-15 05:41:14	superbia	but when i close gnome and return to ratpoison
2014-11-15 05:41:26	superbia	i fear that there will be alot of gnome-programs still opened
2014-11-15 05:42:49	Noxbru	I guess that I have a lot of gnome-things
2014-11-15 05:42:52	Noxbru	let me check
2014-11-15 05:44:17	Noxbru	ok, gnome-keyring-daemon, gnome-session, gnome-shell, gnome-settings-daemon, online accounts, the calendar... and a couple of helpers launched as using gnome (ssh)
2014-11-15 05:44:57	superbia	so you start gnome-session ?
2014-11-15 05:45:05	superbia	is it possible to just start gnome
2014-11-15 05:45:16	Noxbru	I guess that gdm starts it when login in
2014-11-15 05:45:21	Noxbru	or maybe to start gdm

2014-11-15 11:00:58	zell1	Hey guys. Having trouble with lightdm after an update. For some reason it continues to fail to start
2014-11-15 11:01:49	zell1	Has anyone had any similar issues with it recently?
2014-11-15 11:02:21	zell1	I've checked the status and the journal -xe. It seems to coincide with cups failing
2014-11-15 11:02:36	Noxbru	cups? can you disable it?
2014-11-15 11:03:29	zell1	I disable the old cups.service and enabled the new org.cups.cupsd.service
2014-11-15 11:04:11	zell1	I also rebooted after that and nothing. I tried reinstalling the greeter and ensured the greeter was correct in the conf file

2014-11-15 11:04:17	Noxbru	and just disabling it?
2014-11-15 11:05:24	zell1	I tried disabling lightdm and enabling gdm with no joy. I'm running open source AMD drivers btw.
2014-11-15 11:05:45	Noxbru	I use gdm and mesa too
2014-11-15 11:06:00	zell1	yeah gdm starts for a sec then fails to command line
2014-11-15 11:06:04	Noxbru	in gdm do you have any kind of error?
2014-11-15 11:06:10	Noxbru	what do journalctl and dmesg say
2014-11-15 11:06:29	zell1	Let me check...
2014-11-15 11:09:15	zell1	I ran both journalctl and dmesg. Is there anything I should grep to make the output shorter?
2014-11-15 11:10:37	zell1	systemctl status gdm says "GdmLocalDisplayFactory: maximum number of X display reached: check X server log for errors"
2014-11-15 11:11:52	Noxbru	then, let's check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2014-11-15 11:13:25	zell1	It's saying that it Failed to load the fglrx mofule. I thought that didn't come with the open source AMD drivers??
2014-11-15 11:15:38	Noxbru	what? that driver shouldn't be there
2014-11-15 11:16:11	Noxbru	you don't have any catalyst or related package, do you?
2014-11-15 11:16:29	Noxbru	anyway, try to blacklist it and see if it starts
2014-11-15 11:16:46	zell1	I might. I used to have the proprietary one loaded but I thought I had removed all Catalyst packages and dependecies.
2014-11-15 11:16:49	Noxbru	also, check if radeon has been loaded
2014-11-15 11:18:50	zell1	Alright how do I check that?
2014-11-15 11:18:58	Noxbru	lsmod|grep radeon
2014-11-15 11:19:36	zell1	Looks like it's loaded
2014-11-15 11:20:32	Noxbru	then, try to start gdm with systemctl restart gdm

2014-11-15 11:22:41	zell1	Yeah I used that guide. Apparently I had some other left over Catalyst stuff I had installed. Rebooting now
2014-11-15 11:25:21	zell1	yeah still no joy
2014-11-15 11:26:09	Noxbru	same problem?
2014-11-15 11:26:11	zell1	Going to reinstall the open source drivers then reboot
2014-11-15 11:26:16	zell1	Yup
2014-11-15 11:26:42	Noxbru	 If you have the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-radeon.conf file remove it or comment the line blacklist radeon in that file.
2014-11-15 11:26:45	Noxbru	If you have a file in /etc/modules-load.d to load the fglrx module on boot, remove it or comment the line containing fglrx
2014-11-15 11:26:57	zell1	will do
2014-11-15 11:27:03	Noxbru	those two steps should make that the radeon module loads and that it doesn't try to load fglrx
2014-11-15 11:27:41	-->	qdata (qbit@unaffiliated/qdata) has joined #antergos
2014-11-15 11:29:11	zell1	There was a radeon.conf file in the modprobe.d directory. It doesn't have anything written to it.
2014-11-15 11:30:46	Noxbru	and no other file that tries to load fglrx?
2014-11-15 11:30:54	Noxbru	then it's strange that it tries...
2014-11-15 11:31:32	zell1	Yeah. And still nothing
2014-11-15 11:31:36	zell1	Pain in my butt.
2014-11-15 11:31:58	zell1	Tried stopping and disable GDM. Enabled and started LightDM and it gives the same errors
2014-11-15 11:32:08	zell1	Wonder what the hell I updated that caused such an issue.
2014-11-15 11:32:08	Noxbru	then I'm a bit clueless
2014-11-15 11:32:15	Noxbru	rmmod fglrx
2014-11-15 11:32:19	Noxbru	modprobe radeon
2014-11-15 11:32:25	Noxbru	and restart gdm?
2014-11-15 11:33:41	zell1	Says fglrx is not currently loaded
2014-11-15 11:34:07	zell1	Think I'll give the proprietary drivers a shot and see what happens. Think I should uninstall mesa (if I can?)
2014-11-15 11:34:51	Noxbru	I just use mesa, so no idea
2014-11-15 11:35:01	zell1	word
2014-11-15 11:35:08	zell1	I'll see what happens. Thanks for the help.
2014-11-15 11:35:19	Noxbru	sorry for not being of more help
2014-11-15 11:37:05	zell1	Nah you helped plenty. We learned what doesn't work lol

2014-11-16 12:03:04	PenguinAnon	The LightDM Lock Screen Gnome Shell plugin has not been updated for 3.14. Is there a configuration file that will allow me to enable it through the Gnome Tweak Tool?
2014-11-16 12:03:45	PenguinAnon	I was planning on doing the same thing for GTile.
2014-11-16 12:03:49	Noxbru	you can try editing one of the files of the extension to try to trick it into thinking that gnome-shell 3.14 is supported
2014-11-16 12:04:01	PenguinAnon	That's what I was thinking. Where are those installed to?
2014-11-16 12:04:16	Noxbru	/usr/share/somethingsomething I guess

2014-11-16 12:08:41	PenguinAnon	Thanks! It looks like metadata.json is what checks compatibility.
2014-11-16 12:08:49	Noxbru	that's it
2014-11-16 12:09:03	PenguinAnon	Re-launching Tweak Tool didn't enable it, though. Maybe it requires a logout.
2014-11-16 12:09:10	PenguinAnon	I'll report back in a sec.

2014-11-17 10:03:42	MichaelTunnell	I use Antergos as my main system but Ubuntu or openSUSE is what I use for live environments

2014-11-17 15:34:55	PenguinAnon	Is there any way to add a custom background to the choices in LightDM?
2014-11-17 15:35:51	ringo32	you need a greeter settings for thet
2014-11-17 15:36:21	ringo32	but i use gtk3-greeter  so you need lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings to configure your greeter as example
2014-11-17 15:37:41	PenguinAnon	it looks like /etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf has a configuraton line that I can edit.
2014-11-17 15:37:44	PenguinAnon	I'll try that.
2014-11-17 15:44:33	MichaelTunnell	PenguinAnon: yes you can do it in the webkit greeter
2014-11-17 15:44:46	MichaelTunnell	I already did it for someone but I dont remember it but I can find it if you want
2014-11-17 15:45:09	MichaelTunnell	ringo32: Antergos does not use the gtk-greeter it uses webkit-greeter
2014-11-17 15:45:55	PenguinAnon	MichaelTunnell: If you have a chance that'd be great. I'm going to try editing that line in the *-greeter.conf
2014-11-17 15:46:52	ringo32	ooops :)
2014-11-17 15:48:30	PenguinAnon	MichaelTunnell: Also, what's the best way to start contributing back to Antergos? For example, the screen lock extension needs 3.14.2 added to the metadata.json. Should I do a fork and pull on that?

2014-11-17 16:34:55	MichaelTunnell	it depends on what you can do really
2014-11-17 16:35:48	MichaelTunnell	the extension is a weird thing....because the extensions are a GNOME thing and are stored in the extensions directory there
2014-11-17 16:36:02	MichaelTunnell	Antergos has the screen lock by default but not sure who makes it

2014-11-17 16:59:38	PenguinAnon	The screen lock extension is there.
2014-11-17 17:00:00	MichaelTunnell	oh in that case sure fork it and then pull request

2014-11-17 18:51:52	JRoemer	Update on the extension issues: It looks like you only need to update extensions for major revisions, and not point releases (3.14 is sufficient for 3.14.2, etc.)
2014-11-17 18:52:31	JRoemer	I was encountering a bug where Gnome Tweak Tool wasn't detecting that properly, and it took manually specifying 3.14.2 in the .json to get it to recognize that the extensions were compatible.
2014-11-17 18:52:50	JRoemer	After reverting the .json files, though, they continue to work as expected.

2014-11-17 23:14:39	MichaelTunnell	although to be fair the fix he gave you was the fix I found a few weeks ago

2014-11-17 23:15:48	MichaelTunnell	the problem with issues like this is that there really isnt a place to put a fix tutorial for it....so the best option is the forum and the forum search isnt all that good
2014-11-17 23:16:02	NuSuey	yeah:/
2014-11-17 23:16:42	MichaelTunnell	but you got it and that is what counts :-)
2014-11-17 23:21:07	NuSuey	so, the other thing I have is .. a bit weird.. system is becoming a bit more sluggish since a few days .. didn't do any upgrades, so .. swap is on, so dunno what that might cause.. but I guess it's harder to help with a thing like this since it's hard to tell what the problem might be :)

2014-11-17 23:24:37	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: very true...first question is do you use Chrome or Chromium?
2014-11-17 23:24:53	NuSuey	chrome >.<
2014-11-17 23:26:53	MichaelTunnell	and there ya go
2014-11-17 23:27:03	MichaelTunnell	Chrome is a bloated beastly piece of crap :)
2014-11-17 23:27:43	MichaelTunnell	it is always 2x bigger than Firefox at the minimum and I have seen where Chrome takes up to as much as 12GB of RAM in a 16GB RAM machine
2014-11-17 23:28:34	MichaelTunnell	limit the number of tabs you use in Chrome and you will see a difference or just use a browser than is not extremely bloated
2014-11-17 23:30:18	MichaelTunnell	Firefox uses about 400mb of RAM with 5 tabs open. Chrome uses about 800MB-1GB with only 5 tabs...it is absurd
2014-11-17 23:30:40	MichaelTunnell	the more and more tabs you add to Chrome the more bloated it becomes
2014-11-17 23:31:22	MichaelTunnell	Firefox on the other hand stays less than 1.5GB of RAM with up to 70+ tabs
2014-11-17 23:32:23	NuSuey	oh
2014-11-17 23:33:24	NuSuey	well chromium does the same, right?
2014-11-17 23:40:23	 *	NuSuey waits patiently till the wise and awesome MichaelTunnell returns back
2014-11-17 23:41:38	MichaelTunnell	yes chrome and chromium are fundamentally and functionally the same
2014-11-17 23:41:50	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: ^
2014-11-17 23:42:27	NuSuey	well what would be the alternative - something else than firefox?
2014-11-17 23:55:40	MichaelTunnell	Midori, Qupzilla
2014-11-17 23:55:49	MichaelTunnell	there are more as well
2014-11-17 23:56:05	MichaelTunnell	or limit your amount of tabs

2014-11-18 11:01:54	pmo	i decided to boot windows up from the machines boot menu instead when i need it
2014-11-18 11:02:01	pmo	works well
2014-11-18 11:02:26	pmo	it doesnt need to be in grub, i only need it for a few work related tasts

2014-11-18 11:07:59	MichaelTunnell	may I ask what tasks they are?

2014-11-18 11:43:54	djschnei	hey, anyone know how I could insert my current zipcode based off of gnnomes location services into the autostart command for xflux.  I travel a bit and it would be cool if xflux could determine where i was when i boot up my laptop
2014-11-18 11:45:00	MichaelTunnell	there might be a config setting for that
2014-11-18 11:45:12	MichaelTunnell	do you know where it is stored?

2014-11-18 11:46:10	djschnei	well you start xflux with "xflux -z zipcode"
2014-11-18 11:46:24	MichaelTunnell	I meant gnome location service
2014-11-18 11:46:30	djschnei	oh not sure
2014-11-18 11:47:03	djschnei	i mean i know it can determine my zip but im not sure if that is 'pipe-able' if that makes sense
2014-11-18 11:47:16	MichaelTunnell	never heard of xflux
2014-11-18 11:47:23	djschnei	flux is really
2014-11-18 11:47:24	djschnei	awesome
2014-11-18 11:47:40	djschnei	basically adjusts the screen temp according to the time of day
2014-11-18 11:47:51	MichaelTunnell	oh yea I've seen a few of those
2014-11-18 11:47:54	MichaelTunnell	I dont like those
2014-11-18 11:48:14	MichaelTunnell	so you want to take the gnome location info and send it to xflux?
2014-11-18 11:49:23	djschnei	haha it's no good if you do anything color sensitive, but a swear it makes it easier to fall asleep after being on the computer for a while.   Yea exactly, so in place of where i put the zipcode in the xflux start command i would nest a command that would grab my current zip automatically

2014-11-18 12:01:45	baalum	I have problems booting the live iso
2014-11-18 12:02:03	baalum	getting a kernel panic, uhs not found or something

2014-11-18 12:02:48	baalum	oh now that link works again.. I saw a login screen
2014-11-18 12:03:57	baalum	you should add a warning to the download area and tell people to use dd

2014-11-18 12:06:13	djschnei	MichaelTunnell, haha yea very understandable
2014-11-18 12:08:16	djschnei	i think this ipinfo.io api will do the trick.  im sure i would never notice the location inaccuracy, it's probably close enough
2014-11-18 12:16:37	JRoemer	baalum: The Antergos download page explicitly links to the recommended methods for installing to a USB drive, and recommends DD. http://antergos.com/try-it/
2014-11-18 12:16:57	JRoemer	There is also a list of GUI uitilites that can be used successfully.
2014-11-18 12:17:02	MichaelTunnell	baalum left JRoemer

2014-11-18 12:17:26	MichaelTunnell	JRoemer: actually just SUSE Image Writer works because it uses dd as the backend
2014-11-18 12:17:54	MichaelTunnell	djschnei: how often do you travel out of your timezone?
2014-11-18 12:18:08	JRoemer	DD works fine! No reason to download a GUI utility for something I can do more easily from the command line.
2014-11-18 12:18:45	MichaelTunnell	JRoemer: yes dd works great...this guy is a new linux user obviously based on his comments and new to linux is not people I would suggest even use anything based on Arch
2014-11-18 12:19:12	MichaelTunnell	JRoemer: sure but some people like GUIs so it is cool that one exists as an option
2014-11-18 12:19:17	MichaelTunnell	I prefer dd though
2014-11-18 12:19:25	MichaelTunnell	and I think Rufus works on Windows
2014-11-18 12:19:54	djschnei	actually never, but my university and my hometown are right on the opposite extremes of the eastern timezone and daylight varies by a few hours
2014-11-18 12:20:52	djschnei	and i fly home not super often but enough where it would be cool for it to be automatic

2014-11-18 13:17:49	pmo	thanks anyways :)

2014-11-18 13:18:03	MichaelTunnell	but I use GNOME so the logo is unnecessary

2014-11-18 13:18:23	pmo	i removed the activities text

2014-11-18 13:19:20	pmo	i had it like that
2014-11-18 13:19:31	pmo	but i like a icon to remind me what distro i am on

2014-11-19 03:41:53	arch_user8941	anyone?
2014-11-19 03:42:58	arch_user8941	I think it would be a good idea to transfer the wiki to Github or somewhere else, because I often get: "Server is currently too busy; please come back later."
2014-11-19 04:48:09	lasers	arch_user8941: Use Archlinux's wiki as a secondary wiki.
2014-11-19 04:48:58	lasers	Learn how to use AUR -- so you can install backintime / skype / others
2014-11-19 04:50:29	lasers	Also, look into AUR helpers. I think yaourt is installed by default. You can use that or something else. Does not matter.
2014-11-19 04:52:27	lasers	Well, it does matter. You should use something you like. ;-)

2014-11-19 06:44:57	nakazanieto	so what i need to do when i need install this?
2014-11-19 06:45:10	Noxbru	you will need to enable the multilib repo
2014-11-19 06:45:18	Noxbru	if it isn't enabled yet
2014-11-19 06:45:26	Noxbru	and just do 'sudo pacman -Ss skype'

2014-11-19 13:39:40	nerfquark	oops
2014-11-19 13:40:53	nerfquark	I attempted to install Antergos late last night and succeeded. apparently, cnchi.py was never found while running cnchi-dev
2014-11-19 13:42:18	nerfquark	i ended up deselecting all the options for additional software options. perhaps this allowed me to complete installation
2014-11-19 13:42:24	nerfquark	-options
2014-11-19 13:42:50	nerfquark	i have no idea how it completed.. and when will the wiki be back?

2014-11-21 20:53:03	Parker__	everytime I install I get a nouveau error
2014-11-21 20:54:59	ParkerR	Parker__, Well I have no clue about the error but glad to see a fellow Parker
2014-11-21 20:55:18	Parker__	Sorry, that was a bad description on my part

2014-11-21 20:56:13	Parker__	I have 4x GTX 980 cards from nivida in the box
2014-11-21 20:56:40	ParkerR	Honestly Id guess that it just isnt supported
2014-11-21 20:56:52	ParkerR	Tried installing the nvidia driver?
2014-11-21 20:56:59	Parker__	and when I add nomodeset to the boot it hangs on the reached graphical interface
2014-11-21 20:57:03	Parker__	and just hangs :/
2014-11-21 20:57:17	ParkerR	Ahh yeah auto boots into guui crap
2014-11-21 20:57:27	ParkerR	Im used to minimal arch installs :P
2014-11-21 20:57:33	Parker__	D:
2014-11-21 20:57:41	Parker__	I should learn how to do that...
2014-11-21 20:57:53	ParkerR	Parker__, does it at least drop you to a command line?
2014-11-21 20:57:59	Parker__	no
2014-11-21 20:58:01	Parker__	it hangs :/

2014-11-23 15:11:26	Aethysius	KDE seems to have messed up my ability to use GNOME, even though it seems as though I'm using lightdm.

2014-11-23 15:13:37	Aethysius	xdm hmm?
2014-11-23 15:13:53	Aethysius	I've been interested in Enlightenment.
2014-11-23 15:14:16	sogretna	Aethysius: why don't you change the runlevel if your login-manager can't manage various DEs?
2014-11-23 15:14:24	Aethysius	But how would I disable one and enable another, lightdm/xdm I mean.

2014-11-23 18:52:18	helpm3	I can't install Antergos :(
2014-11-23 18:52:25	helpm3	The installer dies
2014-11-23 18:52:33	helpm3	Here is my log: http://hastebin.com/unumaqiboj.md
2014-11-23 18:52:40	helpm3	Sorry, it's german :/
2014-11-23 18:53:05	helpm3	line4 says: couldn't find database
2014-11-23 18:53:43	helpm3	After googline what the last line means I found out that it means nothing. http://wiki.antergos.com/Frequently+Asked+Questions#cnchicant
2014-11-23 18:54:07	helpm3	I used dd to setup the usb stick
2014-11-23 18:55:25	helpm3	Aethysius: Any idea why the install fails? I checked, the disk isn't mounted

2014-11-23 18:56:33	juliohm	helpm3, the error is there: alpm.error: transaction preparation failed, pm_errno 15
2014-11-23 18:56:47	juliohm	there is a python script related to pacman that is failing
2014-11-23 18:56:53	juliohm	google around this error
2014-11-23 18:57:09	juliohm	maybe something related to internet connection?
2014-11-23 18:59:19	Aethysius	helpm3: Sind Sie ein Deustcher?
2014-11-23 18:59:22	helpm3	juliohm: ok, but I'm talking to you from the live media, so I'm sure the connection is fine.
2014-11-23 18:59:33	helpm3	Aethysius: ja bin ich
2014-11-23 18:59:39	Aethysius	^^
2014-11-23 18:59:58	Aethysius	Where in good ol' .de?
2014-11-23 19:00:03	helpm3	I ran: pacman -Syu and that resulted in an error too: "Couldn't find database"
2014-11-23 19:00:07	juliohm	helpm3, then the connection isn't the issue
2014-11-23 19:00:10	helpm3	Aethysius: frankfurt
2014-11-23 19:00:35	juliohm	helpm3, so you can test antergos in the liveusb but not install it?
2014-11-23 19:00:48	helpm3	juliohm: exactly
2014-11-23 19:01:05	juliohm	that's annoying
2014-11-23 19:01:24	helpm3	I've the latest stable iso
2014-11-23 19:01:47	helpm3	so idk, if that is happening just to me or everyone else
2014-11-23 19:02:20	Aethysius	When you used dd, did you copy to the drive, and not to the partition?
2014-11-23 19:02:39	helpm3	don't remember that
2014-11-23 19:03:05	Aethysius	did you, for example, do to sdd or sdd1?
2014-11-23 19:03:17	Aethysius	The former is what needs to be done.
2014-11-23 19:03:36	helpm3	But I could install it once... I tried out Gnome.
2014-11-23 19:03:46	Aethysius	Hm.
2014-11-23 19:03:51	Aethysius	Never mind then.
2014-11-23 19:04:14	helpm3	I followed the tutorial on howto install Antergos

2014-11-23 19:05:51	helpm3	I think it may have something to do with it
2014-11-23 19:06:15	Aethysius	huh
2014-11-23 19:07:08	helpm3	I just ran that to see if something is wrong with pacmann, because then it's obvious that the installer can't run
2014-11-23 19:07:41	helpm3	I've no clue what the error means though, I'm an old slackware user
2014-11-23 19:09:41	juliohm	helpm3, I don't have the multilib repo enabled here
2014-11-23 19:09:49	juliohm	maybe you can try without it first
2014-11-23 19:14:07	helpm3	juliohm: I didn't enable multilib by myself, but after disabling it and syncing the repos again with pacman and umounting the disks, then restarting the installer I still get the same error.
2014-11-23 19:15:02	helpm3	juliohm: I am writing from the same machine that I run the live media from and onto which I can't install stock Antergos
2014-11-23 19:15:25	juliohm	helpm3, you're using the GUI installer, correct?
2014-11-23 19:15:33	helpm3	yes
2014-11-23 19:16:35	juliohm	helpm3, if you run pacman -Syu again, the antergos repo is shown as up to date?
2014-11-23 19:16:53	juliohm	the same message appearing in the other repos instead of the 100% bar
2014-11-23 19:17:15	helpm3	I tried the cli installer too, that "seems" to work, but then it asks me to hit OK a "billion" times. That happens right before it finds a circular dependency or something. But just so things are clear, this is all default I selected gnome and partitioned asimply / and /home
2014-11-23 19:17:26	juliohm	It may be something related to that, the database for some reason is not available after you pull in with pacman
2014-11-23 19:17:50	helpm3	juliohm: no it updates the anergos repo again
2014-11-23 19:18:03	juliohm	it must be something related then
2014-11-23 19:18:21	helpm3	yes, all other repos don't update only the anergos repo
2014-11-23 19:18:21	juliohm	as you can see the other repos are shown as up to date
2014-11-23 19:18:37	juliohm	the database for some reason is not being seeing for antergos
2014-11-23 19:18:52	helpm3	Is something wrong with the antergos server?
2014-11-23 19:19:05	juliohm	I really don't know, I'm just a user
2014-11-23 19:19:21	juliohm	Installed Antergos months ago and still using it
2014-11-23 19:19:32	juliohm	I'm talking from it right now on Gnome 3
2014-11-23 19:19:57	juliohm	I don't think the problem is on the server side though, the 100% is reached
2014-11-23 19:20:07	juliohm	everything was downloaded in theory
2014-11-23 19:20:21	juliohm	The question is to where?
2014-11-23 19:20:45	helpm3	Usually /tmp I guess
2014-11-23 19:21:01	juliohm	if you go to /etc/pacman.c/antergos-mirrorlist you'll find the servers
2014-11-23 19:21:05	juliohm	pacmand.d*
2014-11-23 19:21:29	helpm3	and then?
2014-11-23 19:21:47	helpm3	I looked there already, but no idea what to do.. I run pacman-optimize
2014-11-23 19:21:54	juliohm	I have no idea either
2014-11-23 19:22:04	helpm3	heh
2014-11-23 19:22:10	juliohm	:)
2014-11-23 19:22:28	juliohm	good luck with it, I have to solve something else here
2014-11-23 19:23:03	helpm3	I have to leave I'll goto sleep, can you report this bug to someone up the ladder?
2014-11-23 19:23:12	helpm3	Thank you juliohm
2014-11-23 19:23:25	Aethysius	Auf Wiedersehen!

2014-11-24 03:16:14	xnbc	Hi!
2014-11-24 03:16:40	xnbc	I've found a serious bug in the chnchi installer and know roughly howto fix it.
2014-11-24 03:17:55	xnbc	chnchi creates a file called /var/lib/pacman/sync/antergos.db.tar.gz and doesn't rename that file to antergos.db, which causes the installer to think that the database doesn't exist.
2014-11-24 03:18:16	xnbc	Please fix that upstream and release a new iso, pleaaase
2014-11-24 03:18:49	xnbc	This is the error I get: http://bugs.antergos.com/index.php?do=details&task_id=44
2014-11-24 03:19:21	xnbc	NOT FIXED: "Bug is in image from 27.04.2014 (dd/mm/yyyy) fixed. - Thx!"
2014-11-24 03:28:24	xnbc	OK. I fixed it by commenting all mirrors out, except one german mirror and downloading the anergos.db and http://cinnarch.limun.org/antergos/x86_64/antergos.db.tar.gz manually

2014-11-24 07:05:31	Noxbru	hi
2014-11-24 07:05:42	pgkey	The antergos pgp key seems to be causing a problem
2014-11-24 07:06:01	pgkey	pacman doesn't know it, therefore I can't install anything
2014-11-24 07:06:03	pgkey	weird
2014-11-24 07:06:05	Noxbru	when trying to update?
2014-11-24 07:06:17	Noxbru	there's a thread in the forums about that with a solution
2014-11-24 07:06:19	pgkey	no just tried to install a few packages
2014-11-24 07:06:46	pgkey	Good to know :) Do you have a link at hand, by chance?
2014-11-24 07:06:59	Noxbru	no, but I can search

2014-11-24 07:07:22	pgkey	thank you, that'd be nice of you! I've just installed antergos (virgin openbox system)
2014-11-24 07:07:50	Noxbru	this should work, I think
2014-11-24 07:08:20	pgkey	Nice, I'll try that
2014-11-24 07:08:54	pgkey	yeah, seems to work!!
2014-11-24 07:09:00	pgkey	Thank you Noxbru !!
2014-11-24 07:09:02	Noxbru	perfect
2014-11-24 07:09:07	Noxbru	you are welcome
2014-11-24 07:09:53	pgkey	Downloaded 5005,77 MiB now installing (texlive and stuff)
2014-11-24 07:10:12	Noxbru	that's a lot O_O
2014-11-24 07:10:45	pgkey	Any idea how I can findout how much space is allocated NOW, excluding the pacman caches etc?
2014-11-24 07:11:01	Noxbru	df?
2014-11-24 07:11:04	Noxbru	disk free
2014-11-24 07:11:04	pgkey	so that I know how large a fresh openbox install is
2014-11-24 07:11:33	pgkey	yup df -x <directory> what directories should I exclude?
2014-11-24 07:12:07	pgkey	hmm no.. df -x won't work
2014-11-24 07:12:16	Noxbru	if you want to exclude pacman's cache, that's /var/cache/pacman/pkg/
2014-11-24 07:12:28	Noxbru	but df works on partitions
2014-11-24 07:13:00	pgkey	but var is not on a seperate partition
2014-11-24 07:17:01	Noxbru	yes, I know
2014-11-24 07:17:08	Noxbru	you can use du then
2014-11-24 07:17:29	Noxbru	du -sh /var/cache/pacman
2014-11-24 07:22:13	pgkey	ok cool will try
2014-11-24 07:25:49	pgkey	4gb ... could that be true??
2014-11-24 07:26:17	pgkey	What does this command return to you?
2014-11-24 07:26:18	pgkey	 du -sh --exclude=/var/cache/* --exclude=/home --exclude=/dev --exclude=/proc --exclude=/sys --exclude=/root /

2014-11-30 19:51:51	Gunni	hey
2014-11-30 19:56:13	MichaelTunnell	hi
2014-11-30 19:58:06	Gunni	am i just faily or are both installers faily?
2014-11-30 19:58:25	MichaelTunnell	no idea...depends on the error you are getting
2014-11-30 19:58:38	Gunni	well for the gui installer i got some sort of transaction error
2014-11-30 19:59:08	Gunni	and when i tried the cli installer it worked, or seemed to but then it wouldn't boot because it was referencing a uuid that didn't exist
2014-11-30 19:59:17	Gunni	i am trying the cli installer again now
2014-11-30 19:59:30	MichaelTunnell	try something for me
2014-11-30 19:59:37	Gunni	k
2014-11-30 19:59:49	MichaelTunnell	reload the iso...fresh load
2014-11-30 19:59:56	MichaelTunnell	run this in your terminal
2014-11-30 20:00:00	MichaelTunnell	sudo pacman -Syy
2014-11-30 20:00:15	MichaelTunnell	then do this keyboard shortcut
2014-11-30 20:00:24	MichaelTunnell	Alt + F2
2014-11-30 20:00:31	MichaelTunnell	then type in
2014-11-30 20:00:33	MichaelTunnell	cnchi-dev
2014-11-30 20:00:41	MichaelTunnell	then try to install with that
2014-11-30 20:00:42	Gunni	k, sec
2014-11-30 20:02:34	Gunni	k, it opened cnchi 0.6.23, should i go cli or gui?
2014-11-30 20:02:40	MichaelTunnell	gui
2014-11-30 20:03:43	Gunni	k, it's installing, we'll see
2014-11-30 20:06:52	MichaelTunnell	let me know
2014-11-30 20:07:18	Gunni	i will, thanks
2014-11-30 20:12:51	Gunni	MichaelTunnell, installer succeded, boot
2014-11-30 20:12:59	Gunni	in progress
2014-11-30 20:13:05	MichaelTunnell	nice
2014-11-30 20:13:25	Gunni	wow love the login screen
2014-11-30 20:13:33	Gunni	this worked, awesome
2014-11-30 20:15:22	Gunni	suggestion, add cnchi-dev to the instructions in cnchi, like "if this installer does not work for you, reboot and run cnchi-dev"
2014-11-30 20:15:47	MichaelTunnell	it is currently in a development cycle where sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt
2014-11-30 20:16:00	Gunni	interesting
2014-11-30 20:16:04	MichaelTunnell	cnchi-dev is the latest version in case the current version doesnt work for some people
2014-11-30 20:16:15	MichaelTunnell	it usually depends on the hardware whether it messes up or not
2014-11-30 20:16:19	MichaelTunnell	for me it has never messed up
2014-11-30 20:16:38	MichaelTunnell	so cnchi doesnt get updates as much where as cnchi-dev is frequently updated
2014-11-30 20:16:45	Gunni	well, i was using virtualbox, maybe that's not supported :P
2014-11-30 20:17:03	MichaelTunnell	I have done it in virtualbox as well...still no issue
2014-11-30 20:17:27	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is still a very new distro so weird quirks is kind of expected
2014-11-30 20:17:34	MichaelTunnell	:)
2014-11-30 20:18:14	Gunni	yeah i like it, i'm an arch fan myself, tried manjaro, too non-rolling, this is promising
2014-11-30 20:26:04	MichaelTunnell	well technically Antergos is still Arch
2014-11-30 20:26:04	MichaelTunnell	Manjaro is not really arch
2014-11-30 20:26:04	Gunni	yea
2014-11-30 20:26:04	MichaelTunnell	modifying the kernel is a bit much
2014-11-30 20:27:36	Gunni	nice, everything seems to work, even as a vm, 2d, 3d, sound, network
2014-11-30 20:28:04	MichaelTunnell	very cool
2014-11-30 20:28:54	Gunni	MichaelTunnell, does antergos use the arch mirrors too?
2014-11-30 20:29:02	Gunni	seems like it to me
2014-11-30 20:30:02	MichaelTunnell	Gunni: yes it does
2014-11-30 20:30:20	Gunni	sweet, then i can use the mirror i set up but my friend hosts next door ;D
2014-11-30 20:40:12	Gunni	MichaelTunnell, weird kinda non-issue
2014-11-30 20:40:17	Gunni	i ran 'halt'
2014-11-30 20:40:30	Gunni	it just made the window go all funky but not actually turn it off
2014-11-30 20:41:00	Gunni	http://i.imgur.com/I4PD2Qm.png
2014-11-30 20:42:49	MichaelTunnell	weird indeed
2014-11-30 20:43:22	Gunni	doesn't really affect anything except if you run it and put a laptop into a bag expecting it to turn off
2014-11-30 20:43:39	Gunni	overheating from that maybe
2014-11-30 20:43:57	MichaelTunnell	suspend instead
2014-11-30 20:44:12	Gunni	i know, i do, just wanted to mention it
2014-11-30 20:44:47	MichaelTunnell	I'm not a dev...if you could post on forum that would be great
2014-11-30 20:45:00	MichaelTunnell	devs will see it then for sure
2014-11-30 20:50:48	Gunni	MichaelTunnell, just registered on the bug tracker, login button broken for me, weirdness all around
2014-11-30 20:53:24	Gunni	http://bugs.antergos.com/index.php?do=details&task_id=72
2014-11-30 21:09:01	MichaelTunnell	the bug tracker is basically a bug itself
2014-11-30 21:09:08	MichaelTunnell	that is why I suggested the forum instead
2014-11-30 21:09:25	MichaelTunnell	the website and all of the systems around it are being restructured even the wiki
2014-11-30 21:09:41	MichaelTunnell	the forum is the only thing that isnt going to have a big change in the near future

2014-12-01 00:19:26	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: funny but as a Antergos fan and with my distaste of Manjaro being widely public...I have to say this article and the resulting thread is garbage. Phoronix took the opinion of one person who had 3 posts ever on their forum as a reason to make an article about Manjaro users having an issue. One guy had and issue and he wasnt even a long time user, in fact he was new. Phoronix is a completely garbage website that does
2014-12-01 00:19:26	MichaelTunnell	 nothing but sensationalize linux news. Phoronix is the TMZ of Linux News.
2014-12-01 00:21:35	MichaelTunnell	any of the credibility that Phoronix had with being right about Steam has been completely flushed down the toilet.
2014-12-01 00:23:11	MichaelTunnell	they now have a long forum thread about Phoronix's garbage article. - http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?110386-Arch-Based-Manjaro-Users-Express-Concern-Over-Update-Strategy - any of the credibility that Phoronix had with being right about Steam has been completely flushed down the toilet.

2014-12-01 00:31:21	qdata	Phoronix a nice try, but the way he keeps pounding the self promotion gets real tiresome  <- I find that more and more annoying
2014-12-01 00:32:32	qdata	I mean - I see RSS headline about how great November was for Linux so I think it's going to be about Linux; instead it's all about him
2014-12-01 00:32:34	NuSuey	and tweets like these https://twitter.com/michaellarabel/status/529721622031503360 .. yet no article about something BIG happened :o

2014-12-01 10:07:14	NuSuey	MichaelTunnell: would be interested in your reasoning why you stick with Antergos instead of doing an arch install :)
2014-12-01 10:07:51	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: I used to do Arch proper but the install is the main issue because it takes too long for me
2014-12-01 10:09:07	MichaelTunnell	then when my system borked it wasnt worth doing it again
2014-12-01 10:09:19	NuSuey	true.. was thinking of installing arch on my laptop (desktop = antergos) but what would I gain?

2014-12-01 10:10:51	Noxbru	hi
2014-12-01 10:10:53	NuSuey	pillo: hey
2014-12-01 10:11:33	pillo	i just installed Antergos GNome and I was thinking if it is the best choice for a core 2 duo laptop
2014-12-01 10:12:04	Noxbru	maybe... how much RAM do you have?
2014-12-01 10:12:07	sinix	probably not, Gnome can be pretty heavy
2014-12-01 10:12:22	pillo	what should i install instead?
2014-12-01 10:12:24	NuSuey	pillo: well I'm thinking about doing the same.. just not sure about gnome (have gnome on desktop)
2014-12-01 10:12:42	pillo	maybe mate?
2014-12-01 10:12:48	NuSuey	xfce?
2014-12-01 10:12:54	pillo	yes
2014-12-01 10:12:57	Noxbru	try-catch
2014-12-01 10:13:31	pillo	catch?
2014-12-01 10:13:38	sinix	pillo: xfce is generally what people use who have resource constraints, but Openbox is light as well
2014-12-01 10:13:47	NuSuey	or budgie desktop? http://i.imgur.com/eG5QOlx.jpg
2014-12-01 10:14:01	Noxbru	try one, and if you don't like it 'catch' and try another ;)
2014-12-01 10:14:28	NuSuey	I do have elementaryOS installed on my laptop which has a gnome fork and it it's quite speedy..
2014-12-01 10:14:53	NuSuey	I just like to have an antergos/arch disto instead
2014-12-01 10:14:59	pillo	Nusey what de is that?
2014-12-01 10:15:19	sinix	that's budgie
2014-12-01 10:15:29	pillo	budgie? lol
2014-12-01 10:15:57	NuSuey	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pantheon
2014-12-01 10:16:06	NuSuey	nope its not budgie
2014-12-01 10:16:17	NuSuey	budgie = evolveOS
2014-12-01 10:16:51	pillo	is it based on arch?
2014-12-01 10:16:53	sinix	yeah - the pic you posted is budgie

2014-12-01 10:18:52	sinix	either way - pillo I don't recommend using budgie in arch, it's not ready
2014-12-01 10:19:12	NuSuey	yup.. very 'work in progress' curently
2014-12-01 10:19:22	pillo	so then i ll try xfce or mate? any preferences and if so why?
2014-12-01 10:19:45	NuSuey	I would say xfce (don't like mint's DEs)

2014-12-01 11:09:50	MichaelTunnell	sinix: please dont suggest xfce, instead suggest MATE
2014-12-01 11:10:21	MichaelTunnell	just as a general rule, because XFCE is a mess especially on Arch
2014-12-01 11:11:37	MichaelTunnell	XFCE is completely locked to certain versions of packages and Arch updates all the time...this will, and has already many times, created large bugs and breakage.

2014-12-01 11:13:14	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: as per our conversation earlier...you would gain basically nothing except the understanding of how Arch is put together. If you have never installed Arch before then I would suggest at least doing it once in a VM. I dont think it is needed to always be done like they want it to be but at least once it should be.
2014-12-01 11:13:53	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: also please dont suggest xfce, same reasons as above
2014-12-01 11:15:14	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: elementaryOS' DE, Pantheon, is NOT based on GNOME. It is not a fork of GNOME at all. It is completely independently made but yes they essentially copied a ton of what GNOME did and at the same time GNOME copied some of what they did....mostly Pantheon is inspired by GNOME not based on it
2014-12-01 11:15:43	NuSuey	damn, sorry for suggesting it then. you are a wise man and a schollar MichaelTunnell ;)
2014-12-01 11:16:42	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: also MATE is NOT a Mint DE as you suggested that it was
2014-12-01 11:20:45	MichaelTunnell	NuSuey: Clem of Mint is one of the main contributors to MATE but he is not a founder and he is not in control of it. MATE is a separate project that he contributes to
2014-12-01 11:22:54	NuSuey	oh:)

2014-12-01 11:55:08	superbia	installed gnome finally..
2014-12-01 11:55:12	superbia	all works ok-ish
2014-12-01 11:55:28	superbia	but how can i select my own picture for the lock screen
2014-12-01 11:56:10	Noxbru	settings -> background
2014-12-01 11:57:14	superbia	indeed
2014-12-01 11:57:19	superbia	i have a workspace se there
2014-12-01 11:57:20	superbia	set
2014-12-01 11:57:48	superbia	but when i have a locked screen, the "login manager" or whatever that thing is has "official antergos pictures only"
2014-12-01 11:57:49	MichaelTunnell	superbia: do you mean your avatar or do you mean login screen
2014-12-01 11:58:09	superbia	MichaelTunnell: when i press the "LOCK" in the top right screen
2014-12-01 11:58:13	superbia	i go to fullscreen
2014-12-01 11:58:38	MichaelTunnell	are you talking about lightdm?
2014-12-01 11:58:45	superbia	possibly
2014-12-01 11:59:05	MichaelTunnell	lightdm has a ton of different options that display at random
2014-12-01 11:59:07	MichaelTunnell	that one?
2014-12-01 11:59:15	superbia	yep
2014-12-01 11:59:37	superbia	but it seems that gnome->background doesnt impact lightdm
2014-12-01 12:00:11	MichaelTunnell	superbia: yea it isnt meant to, I think Noxbru misunderstood what you were asking for
2014-12-01 12:00:36	superbia	but where is that LockScreen
2014-12-01 12:00:43	superbia	is it lightdm ?
2014-12-01 12:01:10	MichaelTunnell	superbia: https://github.com/Antergos/lightdm-webkit-theme-antergos
2014-12-01 12:01:31	superbia	i mean
2014-12-01 12:01:37	MichaelTunnell	Antergos uses LightDM by default so if you didnt change it then that is what you have
2014-12-01 12:02:01	MichaelTunnell	superbia: there is not a gui to change it...you need to look in the theme folder to make the changes
2014-12-01 12:02:16	MichaelTunnell	you can find the info in the install instructions of the link I gave you
2014-12-01 12:02:27	superbia	why doesnt antergos use stock gnome locker
2014-12-01 12:02:32	superbia	why use lightdm
2014-12-01 12:03:13	MichaelTunnell	gdm is very restrictive but I have no idea what the actual reason why they chose what they chose
2014-12-01 12:03:41	superbia	all i wanted was simple stuff...
2014-12-01 12:03:55	superbia	since i used a simple wm for years now..
2014-12-01 12:03:59	superbia	i didnt want more complication
2014-12-01 12:04:37	MichaelTunnell	then why would you choose GNOME? Openbox would be the most minimalistic approach for defaults...or install the Base version and choose whatever you want to use
2014-12-01 12:04:48	superbia	i used ratpoison for 2 years
2014-12-01 12:05:02	superbia	and i dont want to look un-normal
2014-12-01 12:05:07	MichaelTunnell	All of the DE choices come with preset defaults but Base does not. Openbox is just the most minimal.
2014-12-01 12:05:10	superbia	that is why i opted to use gnome on my notebook
2014-12-01 12:05:28	superbia	i still run ratpoison on desktop... but for laptop
2014-12-01 12:05:41	superbia	i think its nicer to not have to manually configure all stuff
2014-12-01 12:05:53	superbia	here my screen dimming works, media keys work etc..
2014-12-01 12:05:57	MichaelTunnell	then your request for minimalism is not reasonable if you are coming from ratpoison and expecting the experience to be just asthetic
2014-12-01 12:06:08	MichaelTunnell	when choosing GNOME I mean
2014-12-01 12:06:10	superbia	i just wanted to click click change picture
2014-12-01 12:06:19	superbia	:)
2014-12-01 12:06:43	Noxbru	wait a second, I can change the background of my lockscreen from where I said
2014-12-01 12:06:45	MichaelTunnell	yea but why? obviously ratpoison doesnt give you that
2014-12-01 12:06:59	superbia	Noxbru: i cant use it

2014-12-01 12:17:06	superbia	same picture is selected there

2014-12-01 12:22:19	MichaelTunnell	I wanted a screenshot of once you clicked the Lock Screen button in the settings
2014-12-01 12:22:31	MichaelTunnell	it says Background and Lock Screen in your screenshot
2014-12-01 12:22:41	superbia	this is enough i think
2014-12-01 12:22:43	MichaelTunnell	click Lock Screen and then the screenshot on the next window
2014-12-01 12:26:36	superbia	how is gnome filemanager called
2014-12-01 12:27:25	MichaelTunnell	Nautilus

2014-12-01 12:28:33	Noxbru	superbia: I'm not sure, but maybe you will have to touch the lightdm config file... but as I am not using lightdm I can't test it, sorry
2014-12-01 12:29:13	superbia	well its a bug..
2014-12-01 12:29:16	superbia	what more can i say
2014-12-01 12:29:25	MichaelTunnell	Files is the "pretty" name in the App Drawers and Nautilus is the command name of the app
2014-12-01 12:29:32	Noxbru	on a side note, look who answered the first here https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=149945 :)

2014-12-01 12:31:25	superbia	so..
2014-12-01 12:31:33	superbia	the point of simplicity//
2014-12-01 12:31:47	superbia	i just wanted to click click change lockscreen..
2014-12-01 12:31:56	Noxbru	the problem is that lightdm doesn't give an easy way for locking the screen
2014-12-01 12:32:04	MichaelTunnell	I dont understand your question...Antergos/GNOME has that as Noxbru and I explained
2014-12-01 12:32:15	superbia	show me how to screenshot lightdm
2014-12-01 12:32:26	superbia	im obviously talking something doesnt work
2014-12-01 12:32:31	Noxbru	so an extension for doing it was done: https://github.com/Antergos/antergos-packages/tree/master/gnome-shell-extension-lockscreen-lightdm
2014-12-01 12:32:31	superbia	and you dont take me seriously enough..
2014-12-01 12:33:08	Noxbru	now, that extension calls dm-tool lock, the problem is: "Where does that tool takes the background image for the 'lockscreen'?"

2014-12-01 12:39:25	MichaelTunnell	you can choose it from the Lock Screen the wallpaper is a sidebar on the right
2014-12-01 12:40:41	superbia	didnt try..
2014-12-01 12:40:50	superbia	i only tried to change my desktop image

2014-12-01 12:46:02	MichaelTunnell	just did some testing and the lock screen options only apply to GDM
2014-12-01 12:46:33	superbia	so i was right?
2014-12-01 12:48:29	Noxbru	summary: dm-tool lock from lightdm doesn't take the background from gnome-shell's lockscreen
2014-12-01 12:49:02	MichaelTunnell	not to what you said about the tabs but GNOME settings does not affect LightDM which is what I thought in the first place (Noxbru confusing me :) )
2014-12-01 12:49:08	Noxbru	it's a long shot™, but... could you try changing the background for the greeter?
2014-12-01 12:49:18	superbia	and i was just listening to Theo De Raadt saying the code quality has gotten better since 1990s
2014-12-01 12:49:33	superbia	he said compilers had gotten better
2014-12-01 12:49:46	MichaelTunnell	they have
2014-12-01 12:49:48	superbia	but i say devs have gotten even worser
2014-12-01 12:49:58	Noxbru	doesn't mean that inter-work-thing doesn't break XD
2014-12-01 12:49:59	MichaelTunnell	I disagree
2014-12-01 12:52:11	superbia	basically
2014-12-01 12:52:16	superbia	its also my fault
2014-12-01 12:52:20	superbia	because i dont know what doesnt work
2014-12-01 12:52:26	superbia	since i never used a DE
2014-12-01 12:52:42	superbia	so terms like lock-screen display mananger, login managers are the same to me
2014-12-01 12:53:52	MichaelTunnell	no one expecting you to know the terms, I asked you these terms to verify if I understood what you were asking about and then I describe it further to clarify
2014-12-01 12:54:06	superbia	well
2014-12-01 12:54:16	superbia	can i remove lightdm and install gdm
2014-12-01 12:54:29	superbia	if its simple
2014-12-01 12:54:30	MichaelTunnell	of course, it is Arch based, you can do whatever you want
2014-12-01 12:54:31	Noxbru	haha, that's the easy way XD
2014-12-01 12:54:42	superbia	i dont know :D
2014-12-01 12:54:48	superbia	gnome has a lots of deps
2014-12-01 12:55:10	Noxbru	I know, that's why gdm was dropped in favour of lightdm long ago ;)
2014-12-01 12:55:15	Noxbru	more or less
2014-12-01 12:55:23	MichaelTunnell	GNOME does not depend on a lock screen, if it did them GDM would already be being used thus the concerns are not needed
2014-12-01 12:55:45	superbia	ok
2014-12-01 12:55:52	superbia	how to replace lightdm
2014-12-01 12:55:55	MichaelTunnell	GDM is a tool that can be used or not...it is not a dependency
2014-12-01 12:56:04	MichaelTunnell	uninstall it and install gdm
2014-12-01 12:56:05	Noxbru	gnome does not depend on a dm, it just happens that gdm gives also the lockscreen
2014-12-01 12:56:39	superbia	how to uninstall it
2014-12-01 12:56:46	superbia	to pull all lightdm repos
2014-12-01 12:56:47	Noxbru	sudo pacman -R lightdm
2014-12-01 12:56:50	MichaelTunnell	Have you ever used arch before?
2014-12-01 12:56:56	superbia	has deps
2014-12-01 12:57:11	Noxbru	-Rsn

2014-12-01 12:57:26	superbia	im affraid it doesnt take half of gnome with it
2014-12-01 12:57:51	MichaelTunnell	none of those are GNOME, the packages say what they are
2014-12-01 12:58:10	Noxbru	why would it? lighdm doesn depend on gnome, or the other way around
2014-12-01 12:58:36	superbia	ok
2014-12-01 12:58:42	superbia	i removed lightdm
2014-12-01 12:58:44	superbia	installed gdm
2014-12-01 12:58:49	superbia	how to tell gnome to use gdm now
2014-12-01 12:59:06	Noxbru	sudo systemctrl enable gdm
2014-12-01 12:59:24	Noxbru	systemctl
2014-12-01 12:59:36	superbia	Failed to execute operation: File exists
2014-12-01 13:00:07	MichaelTunnell	take out the r in the command as Noxbru corrected
2014-12-01 13:00:32	superbia	sudo: systemctrl: command not found
2014-12-01 13:00:38	superbia	that would be with R
2014-12-01 13:00:44	superbia	without R its what i wrote above
2014-12-01 13:01:11	MichaelTunnell	sudo systemctl disable lightdm
2014-12-01 13:01:27	MichaelTunnell	afterwards, sudo systemctl enable gdm

2014-12-01 13:02:00	superbia	no errors
2014-12-01 13:02:05	superbia	now i need to reboot ?

2014-12-01 13:05:11	MichaelTunnell	I dont see how we could...Antergos isnt going to fork the GNOME Settings tools just for that
2014-12-01 13:05:22	MichaelTunnell	oh yea
2014-12-01 13:05:27	MichaelTunnell	he expected us to do it
2014-12-01 13:05:33	Noxbru	anyway, this is just a problem of interoperativity between gnome and lightdm, we can't do anything
2014-12-01 13:06:08	MichaelTunnell	exactly but people like that dont care what the issue is...
2014-12-01 13:06:57	MichaelTunnell	the fact that this person doesnt understand pacman or systemd or knows what nautilus is....yet claims to be a ratpoison diehard...sounds like so much garbage
2014-12-01 13:09:20	Noxbru	well... I always have to check how to remove packages with pacman (sn part of the -Rsn)

2014-12-05 09:22:49	vikas	Can you tell me about bugs on antegros/
2014-12-05 09:22:53	Noxbru	mostly to discuss about Antergos
2014-12-05 09:23:03	Noxbru	bugs? like what?
2014-12-05 09:23:17	Noxbru	once you have it installed it's much like Arch
2014-12-05 09:23:26	Noxbru	and it also depends on what you call 'bug'
2014-12-05 09:23:47	vikas	Thanks..But I am new to Arch thats why asking
2014-12-05 09:24:11	Noxbru	sure, ask everything you want, I'll answer as best as I can
2014-12-05 09:25:04	vikas	I recently faced issues like touchpad not working,audio reset to level 0 everytime I reboot in other distros.
2014-12-05 09:26:06	vikas	Can you tell me how to fix these issues?

2014-12-05 09:26:26	vikas	If i faced on antegros
2014-12-05 09:26:49	Noxbru	well... I'm afraid that not, at least not without knowing more about the issues
2014-12-05 09:27:55	Noxbru	the only way to see if it happens in Antergos too would be to try it, I'm afraid
2014-12-05 09:28:22	Noxbru	also, maybe your issue is one of this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad#Troubleshooting

2014-12-05 09:29:34	vikas	Thanx for the link
2014-12-05 09:31:06	vikas	Will try after installing it.
2014-12-05 09:32:23	vikas	Will it run smoothly on Intel core 2 duo processor with 2 gb ram?
2014-12-05 09:32:49	Noxbru	depends on the desktop you choose
2014-12-05 09:33:25	vikas	OK, Any basic desktop environment?
2014-12-05 09:33:32	vikas	suggestion?
2014-12-05 09:33:39	Noxbru	basic basic is openbox
2014-12-05 09:34:01	Noxbru	I use gnome-shell, but it may be a lot for 2GB of RAM, same as KDE
2014-12-05 09:34:40	vikas	Openbox any other?
2014-12-05 09:34:52	Noxbru	Mate maybe
2014-12-05 09:35:04	Noxbru	it's like the old gnome 2.x (it is a fork of that project)
2014-12-05 09:35:26	Noxbru	xfce is also nice, but I have read that it is a bit of a mess in Arch
2014-12-05 09:35:36	Noxbru	I haven't tried it, so I can't tell for sure
2014-12-05 09:35:43	vikas	Ok..

2014-12-05 09:44:55	Noxbru	I'd say openbox, it is like a feather :)
2014-12-05 09:45:05	Noxbru	also haven't tried it myself...
2014-12-05 09:45:24	Noxbru	but that's what they say, and some of Antergos' users use that
2014-12-05 09:45:35	vikas	Hmm
2014-12-05 09:45:56	vikas	Ok, do you arch linux install?
2014-12-05 09:46:04	Noxbru	?

2014-12-05 09:46:29	vikas	I mean to say Have any experience about Arch ?
2014-12-05 09:46:48	Noxbru	with plain Arch? a couple of installs in virtual machines
2014-12-05 09:47:04	Noxbru	apart from that, I usually think of myself as using Arch
2014-12-05 09:47:05	vikas	Yup Plain Arch
2014-12-05 09:49:03	vikas	Thanx
2014-12-05 09:49:29	vikas	Can you tell me about XFCE?

2014-12-05 09:57:03	Noxbru	maybe, although I doubt... maybe you should ask in your distro IRC channel/forum?
2014-12-05 09:57:51	vikas	I searched various forum with same issue but didnt get my touchpad fixed
2014-12-05 09:58:17	Noxbru	then... maybe file a bug?

2014-12-05 10:15:33	vikas	can i make my downloads directly in a ntfs format partition drive?
2014-12-05 10:16:18	MichaelTunnell	sure but depends what you are trying to do
2014-12-05 10:16:45	MichaelTunnell	Linux doesnt need ntfs and is better on many other options
2014-12-05 10:17:11	MichaelTunnell	ntfs is only needed with Linux if you intend to dual boot or need to mount the partition in both Linux and Windows
2014-12-05 10:17:18	MichaelTunnell	ntfs is the only thing Windows supports
2014-12-05 10:17:24	vikas	actually I want my data that i download from internet directly goes to ntfs partition?
2014-12-05 10:17:55	MichaelTunnell	I am not sure what you are asking...just choose a folder on the partition and it will put it there
2014-12-05 10:19:37	vikas	Any help?
2014-12-05 10:20:28	MichaelTunnell	your question is super vague and thus not clear what you are actually trying to do...the only answer I can give is also vague which is just choose a folder on the partition to save when your browser asks you where to save it
2014-12-05 10:20:29	vikas	ok
2014-12-05 10:21:04	MichaelTunnell	feel free to clarify for a more specific answer
2014-12-05 10:21:54	vikas	thanx I got it ...
2014-12-05 10:22:31	vikas	And can you help me about touchpad issues like not detecting
2014-12-05 10:22:35	MichaelTunnell	alright
2014-12-05 10:23:26	vikas	sometimes it detects otherwise I have to use mouse instead
2014-12-05 10:23:27	MichaelTunnell	not really that is a kernel thing and specifc to your hardware. If you hardware is not supported there isnt really anything that can force it at that level unless there are specific kernel modules for your hardware
2014-12-05 10:23:34	MichaelTunnell	you would need to research your hardware with your issue
2014-12-05 10:24:03	MichaelTunnell	actually sounds like your touchpad has an on/off feature that is getting triggered\

2014-12-07 08:23:23	perro	Hello. I have a new notebook. Can I install the testing version or I should wait for the stable version of Antergos? What's the difference?
2014-12-07 08:23:45	-->	iqualfragile (~iqualfrag@unaffiliated/iqualfragile) has joined #antergos
2014-12-07 08:32:55	MichaelTunnell	There isnt such a thing as a testing version of Antergos
2014-12-07 08:33:24	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is a very different breed of distro perro so it isnt very intuitive at first
2014-12-07 08:33:55	MichaelTunnell	Antergos is not a distro in the traditional sense
2014-12-07 08:33:59	perro	Im talking about -> http://build.antergos.org/browse/testing
2014-12-07 08:34:37	MichaelTunnell	my point is you would not be installing anything testing from those ISOs
2014-12-07 08:34:57	MichaelTunnell	the ISOs are Testing but what they install is Stable Arch packages
2014-12-07 08:35:30	perro	oh! I understand now
2014-12-07 08:35:35	perro	thankz
2014-12-07 08:35:37	MichaelTunnell	The stable ISOs don't always work for some hardware
2014-12-07 08:35:52	MichaelTunnell	the Testing ISOs tend to fix some quirks for some people.
2014-12-07 08:36:08	MichaelTunnell	If you use the stable ISO and it works then the Testing ISO will do nothing different than the stable
2014-12-07 08:36:32	MichaelTunnell	they both will install the same packages from the same repos...and they will both be installing the latest versions
2014-12-07 08:37:04	MichaelTunnell	the only difference is possibly the defaults chosen in the Testing might be different than the stable iso...but that depends on the DE you choose and I doubt it would be drastically different either way
2014-12-07 08:37:45	perro	nice, thankz for your time
2014-12-07 08:37:49	MichaelTunnell	welcome

2014-12-09 23:35:39	gandre	Hi
2014-12-09 23:36:23	gandre	Each time I lock the session, then unlock it, keyboard map comes back to us. Do you know why ?
2014-12-09 23:39:00	gandre	There are two other issues, screen never shuts down when computer is not used more than the delay, and Super+L does not lock the screen. I read somewhere it was because GNOME 3  goes through gdm to manage this, and antergos comes with lightdm instead, is that true ? Is the lock button the only way to lock the screen ?
2014-12-09 23:39:52	gandre	But I am impressed by your work, thank you guys. No need to spend half a day to install a working archlinux desktop installation anymore !

2014-12-10 08:43:52	mark_g	if i use antergos to set up arch: a) can i over time migrate to arch proper without much hassle, b) does it use the same packages?
2014-12-10 08:44:15	Noxbru	a) mostly, yes
2014-12-10 08:44:17	Noxbru	b) mostly, yes
2014-12-10 08:44:51	Noxbru	a) depends on what you have choosen as a desktop and how much of Antergos' configuration you want to keep
2014-12-10 08:45:10	mark_g	for b, i mean does it use the same binaries, of does it have its own builds?
2014-12-10 08:45:18	Noxbru	b) Antergos also has a couple of packages in its own repo, if you don't need them, then you are using Arch's repos
2014-12-10 08:45:28	mark_g	thanks
2014-12-10 08:45:35	Noxbru	you are welcome
2014-12-10 08:46:00	mark_g	is there a wiki somewhere on how to switch over?
2014-12-10 08:46:26	Noxbru	from arch to antergos?
2014-12-10 08:46:30	mitfree	the diffrence is cosmetic
2014-12-10 08:46:35	Noxbru	or from other distro to antergos?

2014-12-10 08:47:05	koloss	hello
2014-12-10 08:47:08	mitfree	or should I say superficial
2014-12-10 08:47:11	mark_g	antergos -> arch, i am looking to install it on some system where it's likely to have to run about a decade and i think arch is a safer bet over that timescale
2014-12-10 08:47:15	koloss	I've got troubles with nvidia drivers
2014-12-10 08:47:15	Noxbru	hi koloss
2014-12-10 08:47:40	koloss	hi Noxbru
2014-12-10 08:47:45	mark_g	so i'd like to know beforehand how much trouble migrating to the parent distro would be
2014-12-10 08:47:53	Noxbru	mitfree: the difference isn't just cosmetic or superficial, Antergos also creates some of the configurations and installs some packages by default
2014-12-10 08:48:06	Noxbru	as the web browser or the music player
2014-12-10 08:48:43	Noxbru	mark_g: I don't think that you would  have much problems, also, you can just install the 'base' version and build from there
2014-12-10 08:48:45	koloss	I don't know why but, When using GL I've got only 30fps maximum not 60
2014-12-10 08:49:02	Noxbru	koloss: mesa or the blob?
2014-12-10 08:49:25	koloss	no nvidia closed driver
2014-12-10 08:50:33	koloss	I was on "nouveau" but I had somes screen freezes but no tearings
2014-12-10 08:50:35	Noxbru	not much experience there... if there isn't anything in Arch's wiki then...
2014-12-10 08:51:26	koloss	I also tried nouveau-git but same problem :::> screen freeze
2014-12-10 08:51:50	Noxbru	koloss: you can also help with the drivers by filing a bug :)
2014-12-10 08:52:05	mitfree	mark_g: worst case scenario, if the Antergos repo goes down... you could just comment it out in your pacman config and the update should still work as any arch update.
2014-12-10 08:52:07	koloss	how ? :)

2014-12-10 08:53:52	koloss	Thank you Noxbru
2014-12-10 08:54:07	Noxbru	here's the bug tracker, the usual is just creating a new bug explaining it a bit and describing your system (SO, kernel version, mesa version)...
2014-12-10 08:54:39	Noxbru	you can also try to look for bugs similar to the one you have to see if it is a known issue
2014-12-10 08:56:56	koloss	yes
2014-12-10 08:57:52	mark_g	thanks mitfree and Noxbru i'll start learning a bit more about how everything works in arch/anteros logic
2014-12-10 08:58:27	Noxbru	mark_g: you are welcome, the best place for it is Arch's wiki, although it's very big ;)

2014-12-11 00:42:46	Aethysius	Hrm.
2014-12-11 00:42:46	Aethysius	One moment.
2014-12-11 00:43:51	Aethysius	Do you know what DM you're using/
2014-12-11 00:44:01	Aethysius	GDM, LightDM, XDM?
2014-12-11 00:45:37	north	gdm
2014-12-11 00:45:37	north	I have tried editing the config file at /etc/gdm/custom.conf
2014-12-11 00:45:37	north	following the GDM wiki, but haven't been successful at changing the login greeter to the pixmap version
2014-12-11 00:46:00	Aethysius	Alright.
2014-12-11 00:46:14	Aethysius	Might want to check #archlinux
2014-12-11 00:48:05	north	I see there is an antergos.xml and gnome-default.xml located at /etc/gnome-background-properties
2014-12-11 00:48:08	Aethysius	Have you been to the official GNOME project page, north?
2014-12-11 00:48:35	Aethysius	https://help.gnome.org/admin/gdm/
2014-12-11 00:48:51	north	ok ? But I suppose the greeter is antergos specific. I will check #archlinux anyway. Thank you :)
2014-12-11 00:49:09	Aethysius	Hm.

2014-12-11 10:30:59	freecaster	dmnmsc, oh, why not? :O
2014-12-11 10:31:30	dmnmsc	freecaster: Antergos was my second distro. Was installed on my second ssd. My current laptop just have one ssd.
2014-12-11 10:32:18	dmnmsc	So.. no more Antergos for dmnmsc. It's a mess. Splendid distro
2014-12-11 10:32:42	freecaster	and what another distr do you use on 1st SSD dmnmsc ?
2014-12-11 10:32:53	dmnmsc	freecaster: Chakra
2014-12-11 10:33:34	freecaster	dmnmsc, chakra? have tried it our on usb-stick last month..too FAT
2014-12-11 10:34:31	dmnmsc	freecaster: well using it here for the last 2 years. I can't be happier with the system and community
2014-12-11 10:34:42	MichaelTunnell	Chakra is good if you like KDE
2014-12-11 10:36:03	freecaster	:)
2014-12-11 10:36:31	freecaster	I can install with Evo/Lution installer the full KDE without Chakras tools :)
2014-12-11 10:36:34	dmnmsc	Yeah, sure. If you don't like KDE yhou are f****d
2014-12-11 10:37:00	dmnmsc	just lxqt is available on ccr (Chakra's AUR)
2014-12-11 10:37:49	freecaster	I like KDE, but my PC does not have enough RAM :( So I'm forced to use tiny GUI like MATE 1.8 :)
2014-12-11 10:38:05	MichaelTunnell	dmnmsc: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lxqt/ also in regular AUR
2014-12-11 10:38:09	dmnmsc	I'm using Chakra on my silly AMD with lxqt desktop
2014-12-11 10:38:23	dmnmsc	MichaelTunnell: Yes, I know! :)
2014-12-11 10:38:27	MichaelTunnell	:)
2014-12-11 10:39:36	dmnmsc	If someday I need to leave Chakra, sure Antergos will be my choice.
2014-12-11 10:40:02	dmnmsc	Cinnamon Antergos was awesome
2014-12-11 10:40:08	MichaelTunnell	yep
2014-12-11 10:40:13	dmnmsc	just missing the globalmenu
2014-12-11 10:40:24	freecaster	dmnmsc, you will be welcome in our project: http://www.evolutionlinux.com/
2014-12-11 10:40:30	MichaelTunnell	missing nothing...cinnamon doesnt have a global menu
2014-12-11 10:40:59	MichaelTunnell	freecaster: so you are in here to advertise evo? lol
2014-12-11 10:41:01	dmnmsc	MichaelTunnell: Yeah, Missing globalmenu in Cinnamon, not in Antergos.
2014-12-11 10:41:39	MichaelTunnell	I dont think it needs a global menu but you can do it with applets
2014-12-11 10:41:43	freecaster	MichaelTunnell, lol
2014-12-11 10:42:04	freecaster	no, I am here because I have started to love arch linux with antergos :D
2014-12-11 10:43:35	MichaelTunnell	ahh
2014-12-11 10:44:00	MichaelTunnell	freecaster: Antergos and Evo share code I think so no worries we all on the same side :)
2014-12-11 10:44:59	freecaster	MichaelTunnell, no, we don't have cnchi installer anymore. We have AIS-Installer, easy to use :D
2014-12-11 10:45:21	MichaelTunnell	hmm
2014-12-11 10:45:46	dmnmsc	MichaelTunnell: a must for my system https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2135959/globamenu.png :)
2014-12-11 10:46:31	MichaelTunnell	yea applets in cinnamon can do that
2014-12-11 10:46:44	MichaelTunnell	not by default but there is an applet last I checked
2014-12-11 10:46:49	freecaster	dmnmsc, ¿habla español? :-O
2014-12-11 10:47:00	dmnmsc	freecaster: yes, sure.
2014-12-11 10:47:21	dmnmsc	MichaelTunnell: Do you have a link? Last time I checked I was unable to find something similar
2014-12-11 10:47:41	MichaelTunnell	no sorry...havent used cinnamon in a year
2014-12-11 10:48:00	MichaelTunnell	I dont know if it is even compatible with the latest version of Cinnamon to be fair

2014-12-11 10:51:00	MichaelTunnell	Phoronix is imcompetent garbage
2014-12-11 10:51:09	MichaelTunnell	meh screw fixing typos
2014-12-11 10:51:14	Noxbru	in that I have to agree
2014-12-11 10:51:20	dmnmsc	Can someone say bad things about Antergos?
2014-12-11 10:51:30	MichaelTunnell	dmnmsc: sure I can :)
2014-12-11 10:51:35	dmnmsc	haha
2014-12-11 10:51:42	Noxbru	but, a lot of people read it, and it may help to spread the good word
2014-12-11 10:52:20	freecaster	hey Noxbru
2014-12-11 10:52:39	Noxbru	hi!
2014-12-11 10:52:50	MichaelTunnell	there are a few things that need to be addressed in Antergos but as far as functionality Antergos is quite awesome
2014-12-11 10:53:32	MichaelTunnell	if people take things that Phoronix says as good or bad towards someone or some distro then that saddens me because nothing they do is valid...even their benchmarks are flawed and useless.
2014-12-11 10:53:48	Noxbru	I agree on that too
2014-12-11 10:54:19	MichaelTunnell	Phoronix proves they are completely worthless by making me defend Manjaro.
2014-12-11 10:56:02	Noxbru	you have to learn to take the good parts from the articles... mostly... well... a couple of ideas... and... well... nothing more
2014-12-11 10:57:14	MichaelTunnell	Noxbru: that is like saying I have to take the good parts of being punched in the face and then going "at least he wasn't wearing brass knuckles"
2014-12-11 10:57:34	Noxbru	hell, no
2014-12-11 10:58:11	Noxbru	I mean that you just have to read things like "x project has added support for y" and not much else
2014-12-11 11:01:40	MichaelTunnell	yea but any other website can provide that info too
2014-12-11 11:02:01	MichaelTunnell	people need to stop using that garbage site for the less than 10% of info that is useful
2014-12-11 11:02:06	Noxbru	then... let's follow that other site
2014-12-11 11:02:18	MichaelTunnell	indeed
2014-12-11 11:05:54	Noxbru	anyway, they talked good about Antergos

2014-12-11 11:07:03	Noxbru	haha
2014-12-11 11:07:34	MichaelTunnell	there are many terrible websites in Linux community and I dont really care about them but this guy is awful and people give him credit for being wrong 90% of the time...wtf
2014-12-11 11:07:35	Noxbru	I can understand it, I used to read it a lot, now it's just for a couple of releases news and nothing more

2014-12-12 05:36:52	jgm_	you can look at antergos as an arch installer
2014-12-12 05:37:28	jgm_	makes your life easier
2014-12-12 05:37:32	SAShapeShifter	well thats what i was hoping. any reason the KDE install fails
2014-12-12 05:38:09	jgm_	wich iso image are you using?
2014-12-12 05:38:14	SAShapeShifter	let me look
2014-12-12 05:38:41	SAShapeShifter	2014 /08 /07
2014-12-12 05:38:55	SAShapeShifter	i have tried a other version (earlier) it also failed
2014-12-12 05:38:56	jgm_	you could try a fresh one from http://build.antergos.org/browse/testing
2014-12-12 05:39:22	jgm_	some packages have changed on archlinux so maybe that broke older antergos releases
2014-12-12 05:39:37	SAShapeShifter	thanks. Downloading.
2014-12-12 05:39:50	SAShapeShifter	Ill give feedback once done. have an awesoe day

2014-12-12 05:59:22	Void_5038	after a complete system upgrade (pacman -Syu) xorg just not start. I moved the xorg.conf and xorg-nvidia to .bckp and gnome tried to start, so, I think thats a xorg config problem
2014-12-12 05:59:42	Noxbru	Void_5038: possibly
2014-12-12 05:59:47	Noxbru	wait a sec
2014-12-12 06:00:52	Void_5038	is it a common problem? (usually I use my laptop with intel, so I don't know)
2014-12-12 06:01:05	Void_5038	right, thanks

2014-12-12 06:01:37	Noxbru	this is the problem (the "Remove autoloading patch for nvidia drivers") (or at least I think it may be)

2014-12-20 17:30:09	MichaelTunnell	geosmin: you can if you want to yes but isn't a focus of Antergos
2014-12-20 17:30:14	MichaelTunnell	PacmanXG
2014-12-20 17:30:31	geosmin	so by default you use the terminal to install packages?
2014-12-20 17:30:39	MichaelTunnell	it is included by default for those who want a GUI but it isn't presented as a "first option"
2014-12-20 17:30:59	MichaelTunnell	geosmin: by default you have the option for both, I use terminal
2014-12-20 17:31:57	MichaelTunnell	geosmin: I actually like PacmanXG as a GUI because when you hover a task or action it will give you the pacman command in a tooltip...so it could be used as a learning tool to pacman
2014-12-20 17:32:31	MichaelTunnell	I dont use it but I like it more than the others because it kind of tricks users into learning the commands :)

2014-12-20 17:42:06	MichaelTunnell	well it depends on what field of work you would be wanting to go into
2014-12-20 17:42:22	MichaelTunnell	some industries require one and others dont at all
2014-12-20 17:47:20	shndns	Yeah I know you can get the same place in most fields with Certs. but most decent jobs require certs and experience.

2014-12-27 13:13:11	FMLOhWhy_	michal_: I agree with MichaelTunnell to use a SaaS, but not dropbox. Be it megasync or anything else, it's just too much effort to setup all up on your own unless you really have to because of need to sync more than 50GB and have slow upload speed.

2014-12-27 15:29:50	rikai	Hello. I was wondering if there's a list somewhere of the packages antergos installs by default?
2014-12-27 15:30:21	rikai	Also, if there's anyone about that deals with the wiki, the wiki seems to be down due to load issues. :)
2014-12-27 15:30:57	MichaelTunnell	rikai: yes there is a package list
2014-12-27 15:31:30	MichaelTunnell	rikai: http://build.antergos.org/browse/main
2014-12-27 15:32:08	rikai	MichaelTunnell: hah, ohi. ;)
2014-12-27 15:32:13	rikai	And thanks. :P
2014-12-27 15:32:21	MichaelTunnell	the wiki is pretty much a crap system so it goes down way too often, it is currently being rebuilt with a different system so when the new website launches it will also come with a new wiki
2014-12-27 15:32:32	MichaelTunnell	:)
2014-12-27 15:32:44	rikai	ah
2014-12-27 15:33:10	MichaelTunnell	in the meantime there is really nothing that can be done unfortunately
2014-12-27 15:34:36	MichaelTunnell	rikai: if only they would give me server access :)
2014-12-27 15:36:40	rikai	Mmm, this is part of what i'm looking for, though this seems to be a list of antergos-specific packages. I was more looking for say, a list of packages that differ from an absolute base arch install. Basically wanting to see what packages antergos chooses to install to make a well-rounded desktop.
2014-12-27 15:37:13	rikai	IE: basically a diff of packages betwen a base arch install and a base antergos install, so to speak.
2014-12-27 15:39:25	MichaelTunnell	rikai: I dont think that exists unforuntately
2014-12-27 15:40:03	rikai	Would be something nice to see at some point. So people can see just how antergos differs from stock arch. :)
2014-12-27 15:47:14	MichaelTunnell	I will make a request to the devs...that would be cool to have

2014-12-28 08:14:36	jfkr	hello
2014-12-28 08:16:42	jfkr	I have not updated on antergos machine for a while and now the antergos-keyring seems to old and cannot be updgraded because of the signature. Do you have any idea how to fix that?
2014-12-28 08:17:07	jfkr	I tried already pacman-key --refresh-keys
2014-12-28 08:17:26	jfkr	but that did not allow for an installation

2014-12-28 08:35:56	Riley	hey guys is there a newer iso floating around or is the one from august the last one
2014-12-28 08:36:18	Riley	there hasnt been a release in forever
2014-12-28 08:38:47	Riley	actually scratch that i see the 12/19 testing build iso
2014-12-28 08:38:56	Riley	im going to try that
2014-12-28 08:45:01	jfkr	MichaelTunnell: thanks, for the info. I didn't delete the gnupg folder before. now it seems to work, the first link made it for me but I can't speak spanish and therefore didn't find it
2014-12-28 08:45:47	MichaelTunnell	I meant to link you to the official thread for that which is in English
2014-12-28 08:46:01	MichaelTunnell	someone must have linked that before and I copied the wrong version of it
2014-12-28 08:46:06	MichaelTunnell	oh well problem solved
2014-12-28 08:48:31	jfkr	the english version did not work in the first place. 'pacman-key --populate archlinux antergos' did not work without manually download and install the antergos-keyring
2014-12-28 08:48:38	jfkr	do you have an idea why?
2014-12-28 08:52:19	MichaelTunnell	I did not send you the same thing
2014-12-28 08:52:34	MichaelTunnell	there was another I did not send that was english that was what would help
2014-12-28 08:52:48	MichaelTunnell	they were for completely different but similar issues
2014-12-28 08:53:55	Riley	hey guys for http://build.antergos.org/browse/testing# whenever i click on the download button nothing happens

2014-12-29 03:39:43	stratus_ss	hi Michal, can you be more specific
2014-12-29 03:40:32	michal_	fragment of output: /usr/lib/yaourt/util.sh: linia 166: /usr/bin/package-query: nie można uruchomić pliku binarnego: Błędny format pliku wykonywalnego
2014-12-29 03:40:59	michal_	it means: cannot run binary file: wrong format of executive file
2014-12-29 03:43:36	stratus_ss	are you fully up to day?
2014-12-29 03:43:40	stratus_ss	*date
2014-12-29 03:43:53	michal_	yeah
2014-12-29 03:44:11	stratus_ss	what version of package-query?
2014-12-29 03:44:23	michal_	the newest with *-2
2014-12-29 03:44:39	stratus_ss	hmm i dont have this problem I have 1.5
2014-12-29 03:44:56	michal_	on i686 if it matter
2014-12-29 03:45:10	michal_	then what may be wrong
2014-12-29 03:45:11	stratus_ss	hmm that might, I only have 64 bit available
2014-12-29 03:46:23	stratus_ss	what version of libalpm do you have
2014-12-29 03:48:13	michal_	how can i check that on terminal?
2014-12-29 03:48:49	stratus_ss	well pacman -Q returns your installed packages, i am just looking to see if its a package by itself or whether its installed by some other package
2014-12-29 03:48:50	michal_	the system was fully updated before a moment...
2014-12-29 03:50:05	michal_	I don't have libalpm...
2014-12-29 03:51:15	stratus_ss	I saw an email on the dev mailing list today saying that libalpm update causes package-query to fail making yaourt unusable
2014-12-29 03:51:33	stratus_ss	you can find find it
2014-12-29 03:51:40	stratus_ss	/usr/lib/libalpm.so.8.0.2
2014-12-29 03:51:43	stratus_ss	for example
2014-12-29 03:54:04	michal_	and pamac also unusable
2014-12-29 03:54:25	michal_	so.9.0.0
2014-12-29 03:55:39	michal_	and I told few days ago here that pamac from antergos repo is also unusable because of very similar error
2014-12-29 03:55:54	michal_	wrong format of executive file
2014-12-29 03:56:20	stratus_ss	yes version 9 of that lib breaks yaourt and package-query
2014-12-29 03:56:32	michal_	how can I downgrade it?
2014-12-29 03:57:07	stratus_ss	best if you read the wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/downgrading_packages#How_to_downgrade_a_package
2014-12-29 03:57:23	stratus_ss	i generally hate giving links like this but in case you need more information
2014-12-29 03:57:39	michal_	yeah, but what package has to be downgraded?
2014-12-29 03:57:56	michal_	there's no libalpm on pacman -Q links
2014-12-29 03:58:01	michal_	*list
2014-12-29 03:59:33	stratus_ss	pacman -Qo /usr/lib/libalpm.so.8.0.2
2014-12-29 03:59:51	stratus_ss	or in your case the .so.9
2014-12-29 04:00:23	michal_	I know i can follow this https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en and manually downgrade package-query and install pamac-aur and add package-query to ignorepkg but why I have to do this???
2014-12-29 04:00:49	stratus_ss	it appears to be an update from pacman itself causing the problems
2014-12-29 04:01:08	stratus_ss	in my case the working version of pacman is 4.1.2-7
2014-12-29 04:01:12	michal_	pacman database is already upgraded to new format
2014-12-29 04:01:33	michal_	and for now pacman appears to work fine
2014-12-29 04:02:50	stratus_ss	I would say if you can wait it out, I know our guys are working on it since it has already been reported on the mailing list
2014-12-29 04:03:36	michal_	you mean the errors like wrong format of executive file with pamac and package-query?
2014-12-29 04:04:05	stratus_ss	they are working on package-query and yaourt for sure
2014-12-29 04:04:14	stratus_ss	I am not sure about pamac
2014-12-29 04:04:40	michal_	but pamac is also f... oh, pardon... messed up ;)
2014-12-29 04:05:07	stratus_ss	if you like you can report it on the forums
2014-12-29 04:05:14	michal_	previous version of package-query had the same errors
2014-12-29 04:05:20	michal_	i can do this later
2014-12-29 04:05:53	stratus_ss	ok, sorry I cant be of more help. Just know the issue was reported by one of our dev's to the dev mailing list about 3 hours ago now
2014-12-29 04:05:56	stratus_ss	so they are aware
2014-12-29 04:08:51	michal_	you mean aware of package-query issue only? or pamac also? to avoid confusion?
2014-12-29 04:09:01	stratus_ss	the package-query issue
2014-12-29 04:09:14	michal_	ok
2014-12-29 04:10:14	michal_	anyway, thank you ;)
2014-12-29 04:10:22	stratus_ss	sorry i couldnt be more help
2014-12-29 04:12:59	michal_	I'm about to like killing time here, so don't worry about it ;)
2014-12-29 04:13:25	michal_	I am not sure, if there's such idiom :>

2014-12-29 05:40:26	chinnu	i ran into a problem with pacman when i updated
2014-12-29 05:40:52	stratus_ss	hi, what problem did you run into
2014-12-29 05:41:12	chinnu	failed to initialize alpm library
2014-12-29 05:41:25	chinnu	is the error throsn
2014-12-29 05:41:53	chinnu	[chinnu@laptop ~]$ sudo pacman -Syy error: failed to initialize alpm library (database is incorrect version: /var/lib/pacman/) error:   try running pacman-db-upgrade
2014-12-29 05:42:12	stratus_ss	did you try running the command?
2014-12-29 05:42:28	chinnu	not yet
2014-12-29 05:43:05	chinnu	is the command sudo pacman-db-upgrade?
2014-12-29 05:43:24	stratus_ss	it appears to be based on the output you provided :)
2014-12-29 05:44:17	chinnu	wil try and tel you
2014-12-29 05:45:13	chinnu	it worked thank you
2014-12-29 05:45:28	stratus_ss	:)
2014-12-29 05:46:10	chinnu	my laptop is installed with 4gb ram but the available ram shown in the system details is 3.5gb
2014-12-29 05:46:34	stratus_ss	yes there are a number of things that take ram before the OS gets it
2014-12-29 05:46:36	stratus_ss	for example
2014-12-29 05:46:38	chinnu	i thought using 64 bit os will use 4gb
2014-12-29 05:46:41	stratus_ss	video card, sound card, network card
2014-12-29 05:47:20	chinnu	should i bother about that or just leave it
2014-12-29 05:47:31	stratus_ss	I would guess that your bios is dedicating a bit of your ram for your video card
2014-12-29 05:47:36	stratus_ss	this is a very normal practice
2014-12-29 05:48:15	chinnu	is there any way to improve it
2014-12-29 05:49:33	stratus_ss	well improve is a difficult thing. There are several "IFs". If your bios supports tuning the ram, then if you are ok in decreasing the video performance (by decreasing the ram dedicated to the video card) than yes, there is a way to improve it
2014-12-29 05:49:50	stratus_ss	however, I am not sure going after an extra say 200M of ram is worth it
2014-12-29 05:50:22	chinnu	ya u are right
2014-12-29 05:50:28	chinnu	thanks again
2014-12-29 05:50:38	stratus_ss	no problem

2014-12-29 07:14:34	dmnmsc	stratus_ss: Safe Settings and different resolution did the trick. It's safe to install under this conditions?
2014-12-29 07:14:57	dmnmsc	No, it's not because freezes when getting the desktop xD
2014-12-29 07:15:29	stratus_ss	yes,  the Safe Settings turn of things like hardware excelleration etc so that the installer can work
2014-12-29 07:15:48	stratus_ss	it has to do with no including the kitchen sink with the installing ISO
2014-12-29 07:16:10	stratus_ss	usually once you have completed the install the proper kmods and drivers will be loaded with the standard install
2014-12-29 07:16:34	dmnmsc	stratus_ss: anyway, it's freezing when getting the desktop....

2014-12-29 07:26:14	collegeman	I ran pacman -Syu and updated.. now yaourt is defunct :(
2014-12-29 07:26:23	collegeman	package-query: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2014-12-29 07:26:39	collegeman	I tried uninstalling yaourt and package-query and reinstalling it, without luck
2014-12-29 07:26:51	collegeman	What can I do?

2014-12-29 07:40:40	stratus_ss	the only thing you can do for now is revert packman
2014-12-29 07:41:00	stratus_ss	libalpm was updated to version 9, this broke package-query which yauort depends
2014-12-29 07:41:17	stratus_ss	you can also find an alternatvie method for accessing the AUR (packer maybe?)

2014-12-29 07:54:38	collegeman	stratus_ss: what desktop environment do you use?
2014-12-29 07:54:45	stratus_ss	Gnome shell
2014-12-29 07:54:59	stratus_ss	I've been die-hard gnome user for many many years
2014-12-29 07:55:48	collegeman	I installed every antergos Desktop Environment yesterday...
2014-12-29 07:56:21	collegeman	Mate feels fragile and inconsistent, the ram usage is not pro argument with ~450mb
2014-12-29 07:57:09	stratus_ss	some people really like Mate, personally I am going to stick with gnome, if for whatever reason I decided to leave gnome I would go with Cinamon
2014-12-29 07:57:14	collegeman	Cinnamon looks inconsistent unless you tune it to look good. It's good for thos who love widgets and toying around, but I don't have the opinion that it's a stable environment.
2014-12-29 07:57:54	collegeman	Gnome3 looks elegant and clean, a bit too clean at some times, but then again you can really concentrate on work with that DE
2014-12-29 07:58:28	stratus_ss	with gnome extensions its super flexible as well
2014-12-29 07:58:31	collegeman	KDE would be nice if it didn't interrupt the user with all those needless dialogs, popups and confirmations
2014-12-29 07:58:47	stratus_ss	some people really like Dash-to-dock (included but not turned on in Antergos)
2014-12-29 07:59:08	stratus_ss	cant stand KDE, I like a lot of the KDE projects themselves, but not the DE
2014-12-29 07:59:19	collegeman	that's the only advantage of cinnamon over gnome, it's easier to get dash-to-dock etc. running, altough I got any gnome extension working on gnome too (with a bit of work)
2014-12-29 08:00:55	collegeman	Let's be honest, KDE is very flexible, if it only wouldn't try to push akonadi, desktop search, semantic desktop and all the other hypthetical enhancement down your throat...
2014-12-29 08:01:41	collegeman	It should focus on offering being flexible and put all the manpower into developing plasmoids
2014-12-29 08:02:24	collegeman	to allow people to make their desktop look like openbox, osx, windows7, windows8 or whatever people are comfortable with
2014-12-29 08:02:51	stratus_ss	Flexible I suppose, but to be honest it just doesnt have that "Wow" effect I look for
2014-12-29 08:03:08	stratus_ss	gnome has that, cinamon doesn't necessarily but it has a lot of polish
2014-12-29 08:03:26	stratus_ss	I have my in-laws running cinamon,lots to like about it
2014-12-29 08:03:47	collegeman	stratus_ss: I agree with that. It is not special or doesn't have that wow effect gnome-shell offers.
2014-12-29 08:04:35	collegeman	I think Mate is inferior to Xfce
2014-12-29 08:04:59	collegeman	Xfce feels more polished and integrated
2014-12-29 08:05:00	stratus_ss	I haven't used Mate enough to know
2014-12-29 08:05:14	stratus_ss	well XFCE has been on the same major revision for several years
2014-12-29 08:05:18	stratus_ss	all they do is polish
2014-12-29 08:05:27	collegeman	I'm using linux as my main os since 2003
2014-12-29 08:06:04	stratus_ss	longer than me... i got on board 2006
2014-12-29 08:06:17	collegeman	yeah Xfce doesn't look like it's changing anything, or as if they had a roadmap.. It's meant to be used for users with low-end desktops imho.
2014-12-29 08:07:45	collegeman	I think my stupidity caused me to favor linux over windows.. I bought a 160Eur bluetooth-desktop (mouse/keyboard) and bought a 8dvd linux distro with a very thick manual xD
2014-12-29 08:08:17	collegeman	lucky me did the classic noob job, overwriting the mbr with grub and not knowing howto revert other than "formatting" xD
2014-12-29 08:08:49	collegeman	And I couldn't even get back to windows, because I couldn't format, due to my disk being almost full and having no external harddrive..

2014-12-29 08:46:30	collegeman	karasu: solved it thanks to the guide in the last comment https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/package-query/
2014-12-29 08:46:46	Aethysius	Ah, that mell of a hess.
2014-12-29 08:49:39	collegeman	I hate people who claim to have decided that something is good or bad for you, sounds quite arrogant, even if he's goodwilling at the end. I'm a developer too and the difference is that empathy is often times missing in such folks ...
2014-12-29 08:55:25	MichaelTunnell	it is impossible to have the full amount of RAM you install just like it is impossible to have the full amount of harddrive space advertised for hard drives
2014-12-29 08:55:38	MichaelTunnell	my bad chinnu left

2014-12-29 09:00:45	MichaelTunnell	collegeman: why would you associate your entire ram usage to a DE...obviously that is not the case when KDE doesnt even use that much RAM by itself
2014-12-29 09:01:27	MichaelTunnell	collegeman: Cinnamon is certainly stable...not sure what you are referring to
2014-12-29 09:02:43	MichaelTunnell	collegeman: "that's the only advantage of cinnamon over gnome, it's easier to get dash-to-dock etc. running" - that doesnt even make any sense considering that extension doesnt work in Cinnamon...I guess you mean extensions in general
2014-12-29 09:03:33	MichaelTunnell	collegeman: MATE inferior to XFCE? lol you should change your name to comedian for that one
2014-12-29 09:08:25	detrimental	I had to remove packagekit, install pacman 4.2 then download/compile/install packagekit to install the new version of pacman.
2014-12-29 09:09:03	MichaelTunnell	why do you want to use packagekit? it is very much experiemental
2014-12-29 09:10:25	detrimental	pacman depends on it.
2014-12-29 09:14:35	detrimental	it left me with some work so i wouldn't recommend it, have to change some permissions and ownership. and fix my pacman.conf...
2014-12-29 09:17:06	detrimental	ok, i guess i will remove packagekit since apparently it is no longer being developed. https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2014-December/026859.html
2014-12-29 09:18:20	detrimental	and that was causing the issues i was having so yay.

2014-12-29 09:20:08	Aethysius	Was wondering if you knew how to solve that.
2014-12-29 09:21:11	MichaelTunnell	detrimental: no it doesn't. PackageKit depends on Pacman not the other way around.
2014-12-29 09:21:12	karasu	detrimental: pacman does not depend on packagekit, never has ;) You can remove it because as it is now is useless.

2014-12-29 09:24:04	MichaelTunnell	karasu: it happens :)
2014-12-29 09:24:14	detrimental	yes, i meant the other way around, and linked the article referring to packagekit development being dropped. sorry for the mix up :/
2014-12-29 09:24:15	detrimental	lol
2014-12-29 09:24:30	MichaelTunnell	Aethysius: sure turn on your lights in your room :)
2014-12-29 09:24:49	Aethysius	lol shut up
2014-12-29 09:25:33	MichaelTunnell	detrimental: I was saying there was no reason to use packagekit. GNOME Software would be nice to use and it depends on PackageKit but it doesnt work worth a crap in Arch so that isn't really an option their
2014-12-29 09:26:01	MichaelTunnell	Aethysius: :) but seriously I have no idea. I dont use keyboards like that. I just use regular basic keyboards
2014-12-29 09:26:10	MichaelTunnell	the non-fancy keyboards :)
2014-12-29 09:26:54	detrimental	Yeah, well i noticed since it depended on a different version on pacman i couldn't update, didn't even know packagekit was on my system or what it was until i looked it up and found out i didn't need it.
2014-12-29 09:27:10	detrimental	is it installed by default on antergos?
2014-12-29 09:27:37	MichaelTunnell	no it is not by default as I do not have it
2014-12-29 09:27:43	detrimental	ah
2014-12-29 09:27:59	detrimental	i had gnome software installed at some point
2014-12-29 09:28:22	MichaelTunnell	detrimental: if you still have it installed you can open up pacmanxg and see what package you have installed depends on it... and thus installed it
2014-12-29 09:28:31	MichaelTunnell	oh well in that case there ya go
2014-12-29 09:29:27	detrimental	I don't have pacmanxg, one of the first things i removed when installing antergos, but yeah the gnome software package is what pulled it in, i just didn't remember where it came from.
2014-12-29 09:29:42	MichaelTunnell	an option either* letters just twisting themselves sometimes...my fingers didn't do it...they are just rogue ltteres ( :) )
2014-12-29 09:30:17	MichaelTunnell	ok, pacmanxg is actually pretty good even though it is ugly
2014-12-29 09:30:28	MichaelTunnell	but alright question answered either way
2014-12-29 09:30:34	detrimental	Yes i know, i used to use it when i first came from arch to cinnarch.
2014-12-29 09:31:00	detrimental	But figured it is good practice to learn pacman better instead of having a frontend handle it for me.
2014-12-29 09:31:12	detrimental	:) yes, figured it out.
2014-12-29 09:31:19	detrimental	thanks for the help!
2014-12-29 09:31:22	MichaelTunnell	you can use pacman and still have pacmanxg, don't need to remove it for that :)
2014-12-29 09:31:47	detrimental	I just never use it so didn't need it on my system.
2014-12-29 09:31:55	MichaelTunnell	alrighty
2014-12-29 09:32:01	detrimental	I can do everything via terminal :)
2014-12-29 09:35:09	MichaelTunnell	of course
2014-12-29 09:36:55	karasu	To say the truth, every time I open pacmanxg my eyes hurt a little.... but it's a nice program for novice users to have at hand.
2014-12-29 09:38:53	MichaelTunnell	karasu: indeed...it is hideous but it has a lot of cool concepts
2014-12-29 09:39:16	MichaelTunnell	I really like the task list thing because it tells you the commands when you hover a task so it can be used as a learning tool too

2014-12-29 13:54:43	Yunito	But... I need yaourt to update some AUR apps :/
2014-12-29 13:55:03	axaxs	yaourt isn't compatible with new pacman is the problem
2014-12-29 13:55:17	axaxs	not sure if there is work around yet
2014-12-29 13:55:55	axaxs	actually checking my email
2014-12-29 13:56:03	axaxs	seems they are rebuilding package-query now
2014-12-29 13:56:13	axaxs	so later today it should work
2014-12-29 13:57:32	Yunito	So... Now I will remove Yaourt and Package-Query... Then do you think that they will work?

2014-12-29 13:57:45	axaxs	yes i know it will, just had to do it myself
2014-12-29 13:57:53	axaxs	then later tonight or tomorrow just reinstall yaourt
2014-12-29 13:57:56	axaxs	if you can wait
2014-12-29 13:58:04	Yunito	Yes, I can wait :D
2014-12-29 13:59:06	Yunito	axaxs, do you know how to install this package?
2014-12-29 13:59:22	Yunito	https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/1940/pia-vpn-app-linux-beta
2014-12-29 13:59:49	Yunito	I get a lot of errors related with libjpeg and appindicator
2014-12-29 14:00:05	axaxs	can you throw some in pastebin
2014-12-29 14:00:58	Yunito	Yes, i'll do it when my update will be finished
2014-12-29 14:01:14	MichaelTunnell	holy crap
2014-12-29 14:01:19	MichaelTunnell	do not remove yaourt
2014-12-29 14:01:28	Yunito	S:
2014-12-29 14:01:48	MichaelTunnell	do you have packagekit installed?
2014-12-29 14:02:06	Yunito	I don't know, why?
2014-12-29 14:02:29	MichaelTunnell	because packagekit is what is often holding back package versions
2014-12-29 14:02:34	MichaelTunnell	just check first
2014-12-29 14:02:41	axaxs	it's package-query, read his first message
2014-12-29 14:02:49	axaxs	which is a dependency of yaourt
2014-12-29 14:02:54	axaxs	and nothing to do with packagekit
2014-12-29 14:03:07	Yunito	:s
2014-12-29 14:03:14	Yunito	More errors
2014-12-29 14:03:15	MichaelTunnell	axaxs: but packagekit is holding back the updates for both pacman and package-query
2014-12-29 14:03:39	axaxs	i do not have packagekit installed :(
2014-12-29 14:03:45	Yunito	http://pastebin.com/JRVtjdTg
2014-12-29 14:04:02	axaxs	did you run pacman-db-upgrade?
2014-12-29 14:04:15	Yunito	No, I run pacman -Qs packagekit
2014-12-29 14:04:23	axaxs	run that first
2014-12-29 14:04:48	Yunito	Okey, thanks
2014-12-29 14:04:57	Yunito	MichaelTunnell, I haven't got packagekit
2014-12-29 14:05:02	axaxs	MichaelTunnell Dustin is rebuilding package-query tonight against new pacman
2014-12-29 14:05:07	axaxs	so it should be fine as of tomorrow
2014-12-29 14:05:57	MichaelTunnell	oh he hadnt ran pacman-db-upgrade
2014-12-29 14:06:00	MichaelTunnell	yea that is needed
2014-12-29 14:06:14	MichaelTunnell	yea it will probably be fine then yes
2014-12-29 14:06:18	MichaelTunnell	same with yaourt
2014-12-29 14:07:02	Yunito	Thanks
2014-12-29 14:07:15	Yunito	Tomorrow I'll update package-querry
2014-12-29 14:07:35	axaxs	all you need to do is install yaourt.  If it lets you, it's been updated :)
2014-12-29 14:07:52	Yunito	Now, I'm trying to install Private Internet Access Beta Client for Linux
2014-12-29 14:07:53	Yunito	And...
2014-12-29 14:07:54	Yunito	http://pastebin.com/k9C1Vxf1
2014-12-29 14:08:18	Yunito	http://pastebin.com/ybskMxs0
2014-12-29 14:09:57	axaxs	it's running apt-get commands, that'll never work
2014-12-29 14:10:24	MichaelTunnell	axaxs: indeed
2014-12-29 14:10:30	Yunito	What is the correct way to do it here?
2014-12-29 14:10:33	MichaelTunnell	Yunito: those are for Debian
2014-12-29 14:10:36	MichaelTunnell	or Ubuntu
2014-12-29 14:10:42	Yunito	MichaelTunnell, It is the only package
2014-12-29 14:10:51	Yunito	https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/1940/pia-vpn-app-linux-beta
2014-12-29 14:11:09	MichaelTunnell	Yunito: you need an arch tutorial
2014-12-29 14:11:18	MichaelTunnell	pacman is used on arch to install stuff
2014-12-29 14:12:45	Yunito	don't matter, MichaelTunnell
2014-12-29 14:13:02	Yunito	It needs AppIndicator and It doesn't work for Antergos, I think
2014-12-29 14:13:07	MichaelTunnell	Yunito: you shouldn't really need this anyway since openssh can do this
2014-12-29 14:13:21	MichaelTunnell	AppIndicator is an Ubuntu thing
2014-12-29 14:13:26	MichaelTunnell	so no Arch does not have it
2014-12-29 14:13:54	Yunito	Yes, I thought about OpenVPN and Gnome-Netowork-Manager and I think that will be the final way to do it
2014-12-29 14:14:26	Yunito	Are you using VPN?
2014-12-29 14:15:59	MichaelTunnell	occasionally but not no in this setup
2014-12-29 14:16:19	MichaelTunnell	I havent set one up in my current install of Antergos
2014-12-29 14:16:40	Yunito	I was wondering about buying one but I don't know if it worth of money
2014-12-29 14:16:55	axaxs	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/private-internet-access-vpn/
2014-12-29 14:16:58	axaxs	is this not it?
2014-12-29 14:17:48	MichaelTunnell	axaxs: yes that looks like it
2014-12-29 14:17:57	MichaelTunnell	of course I should have searched the AUR :)
2014-12-29 14:18:24	axaxs	i did the same thing once with bluejeans...spent a while disassembling a package then found it in aur
2014-12-29 14:18:25	MichaelTunnell	Yunito: depends on your need
2014-12-29 14:18:53	Yunito	But in this description says that: Installs VPN profiles for Private Internet Access Service. So I wondered that If it only install openvpn profiles
2014-12-29 14:19:59	axaxs	seems that way actually
2014-12-29 14:20:00	axaxs	is that bad?
2014-12-29 14:21:47	Yunito	No in fact. But the problem is that I wanna use the official app because with OpenVPN I only can use AES-128 and BF-128, and no stronger ones
2014-12-29 14:23:59	axaxs	well not exactly the point but aes 128 is pretty damn strong
2014-12-29 14:24:49	Yunito	Do you think that it is strong enough?
2014-12-29 14:25:08	axaxs	absolutely.  thomas pornin is happy with it so i am too
2014-12-29 14:26:38	Yunito	Thomas Pornin?
2014-12-29 14:27:15	axaxs	hes a security guru.  Don't know tons about him, other than he writes a lot about security on stack exchange/stack overflow
2014-12-29 14:27:51	axaxs	See his answer here (and hyperlinked answer inside"
2014-12-29 14:27:51	axaxs	http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14068/why-most-people-use-256-bit-encryption-instead-of-128-bit
2014-12-29 14:29:46	Yunito	And he says what is better? If blowfish 128 or aes?
2014-12-29 14:30:05	axaxs	that's not the question or answer provided
2014-12-29 14:30:11	axaxs	only why 128 bit aes is sufficient
2014-12-29 14:30:47	axaxs	i dont know much about blowfish, i think schneir wrote that
2014-12-29 14:34:38	Yunito	Okey, thanks
2014-12-29 14:34:56	Yunito	I'll read it
2014-12-29 14:35:20	axaxs	in short...aes128 is unbreakable for decades
2014-12-29 14:40:07	Yunito	It seems

2014-12-29 22:43:44	michaelrose	no offense but the antergos installer is the longest I've ever seen
2014-12-29 22:44:21	MichaelTunnell	michaelrose: I disagree but it depends on your internet connection and hardware limitations
2014-12-29 22:44:58	MichaelTunnell	my installs take about 20 min which is fairly fast for any OS
2014-12-29 22:45:37	michaelrose	installing it on vmware, took over an hour and a half to install the lxde version
2014-12-29 22:46:00	MichaelTunnell	like I said it depends on those limitations of your hardware and connection
2014-12-29 22:46:40	michaelrose	by comparison the iso which is like 800mb downloaded in 5 minutes
2014-12-29 22:47:19	MichaelTunnell	are you aware that Antergos is a net-install distro?
2014-12-29 22:59:51	michaelrose	ya but it should either be less than 100mb or take less than an hour either way
2014-12-29 23:01:26	michaelrose	800 seems to indicate taking WAAY to much room for stuff to make the install environment look pretty
2014-12-29 23:04:10	michaelrose	well anyway there must be some way to cache things to allow for a faster install right?
2014-12-29 23:09:19	michaelrose	ah the biggest difficulty is the fact that although my connection is decent my speed to your servers sucks
2014-12-29 23:10:06	<--	detrimental (~james@thief-pool-117-217.mncable.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2014-12-29 23:19:25	michaelrose	also your login screen has really crummy usability
2014-12-29 23:20:01	michaelrose	you click the time to make the users names appear and when you click that the button to choose a session appears having random stuff come and go is not really good design
2014-12-29 23:21:38	michaelrose	reminds me of the ferry terminal around here, its a really neat bit of art but A) the neat slanted root is too high and slanted the wrong way, b) the seats are not only uncomfortable but have a little lip so all the rain that the dumb roof lets in pools
2014-12-29 23:23:08	michaelrose	he like the guy who designed your log in screen thought he was creating something to be looked at, rather than a tool to be used
2014-12-29 23:30:18	MichaelTunnell	less than 100mb? that doesnt make sense
2014-12-29 23:30:45	MichaelTunnell	michaelrose: the size of the ISO is explained in the FAQ on the Wiki
2014-12-29 23:30:58	michaelrose	I remember net install fedora stuff that was miniscule
2014-12-29 23:31:12	MichaelTunnell	cache what? Antergos installs the latest version of every package so caching wouldn't make sense at all
2014-12-29 23:31:35	MichaelTunnell	net-install with Arch does not mean the same thing as Fedora
2014-12-29 23:33:08	MichaelTunnell	ok you dont like the login screen, then dont use that login screen . . . change it to whatever you want
2014-12-29 23:33:10	michaelrose	also pacman spits weird errors at you until you run pacman-key init and populate which if they require no real choice by the user really ought to be run at install time
2014-12-29 23:33:39	michaelrose	its great that you can change it but it would be smarter to include something by default that sucks less
2014-12-29 23:34:16	MichaelTunnell	michaelrose: your opinion of something that sucks is not valid for everyone so your opinion is noted as well as others who like it
2014-12-29 23:34:43	michaelrose	its objectively crummy to make ui elements only appear when selecting other non related ui elements
2014-12-29 23:35:27	michaelrose	it is completely obvious upon half a seconds inspection how to change the background which is awesome until you realize it takes several seconds to figure out how to do anything else and its entire goal is to help you log in
2014-12-29 23:35:27	MichaelTunnell	you are entitled to your opinion
2014-12-29 23:36:01	michaelrose	it is designed as well as the windows 8 start screen...
2014-12-29 23:36:24	MichaelTunnell	I am not a fan of the login screen but I also dont use a login screen at all so it doesnt even matter to me.
2014-12-29 23:37:00	MichaelTunnell	though for the people who do use one, there are people on both sides who like the current screen and those who dont so it is a case of "can't please everyone all the time"
2014-12-29 23:37:30	michaelrose	there are objective standards of usability
2014-12-29 23:37:32	MichaelTunnell	michaelrose: obviously your are just trying to be insulting at this point
2014-12-29 23:40:09	michaelrose	also its clear that tons of software that is available via ppa on ubuntu derivatives that on arch is only available from the AUR which from the name I thought was just a set of repos ala redhat/ubutu/suse etc ie add it and use the built in package tools to add stuff unfortunately its more like the ports system which is probably awesome for a variety of use cases
2014-12-29 23:40:47	michaelrose	but is way more of a pain to set up, it appears that I need some sort of wrapper program like yaourt
2014-12-29 23:41:22	michaelrose	but there are a whole pile of those
2014-12-29 23:42:32	michaelrose	not clear at all which is optimal of the 17 tools listed in the wiki
2014-12-29 23:42:34	MichaelTunnell	yes the AUR is not prebuilt packages they are compiled at install by the client machine though not really like the ports system
2014-12-29 23:43:00	MichaelTunnell	the AUR like that works best because otherwise it would need way to many system configurations for the different packages
2014-12-29 23:43:25	MichaelTunnell	yaourt is the most commonly used but pacaur is also quite good
2014-12-29 23:43:37	michaelrose	so does installing from the aur with any of the above tools handle deps like pacman does?
2014-12-29 23:44:29	MichaelTunnell	the AUR Helpers are tools to integrate with the Pacman structure though are not directly changing anything with pacman so yes they do allows pacman integration and updating
2014-12-29 23:44:41	MichaelTunnell	pacman -Syu = official repo updates
2014-12-29 23:44:52	MichaelTunnell	yaourt -Syu --aur = AUR updates
2014-12-29 23:45:32	michaelrose	what I'm getting at is how frequently is installing package foo in the aur as easy as apt/yum install foo
2014-12-29 23:48:14	MichaelTunnell	pacman -S foo
2014-12-29 23:48:23	MichaelTunnell	yaourt -S bar
2014-12-29 23:48:53	MichaelTunnell	or the Syu options that I stated for batch updates

2014-12-30 12:27:35	marvelinti	does anyone know a solution?
2014-12-30 12:29:40	MichaelTunnell	http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2526
2014-12-30 12:31:45	MichaelTunnell	marvelinti: ^
2014-12-30 12:33:54	marvelinti	thanks, just for the record, does the extra "antergos" mean that antergos does not exclusively use the official arch-repos? meaning it has its on repository like manjaro?
2014-12-30 12:35:36	MichaelTunnell	no
2014-12-30 12:35:40	shndns	Antergos uses the arch repos but they have their own. Unless somethings changed.
2014-12-30 12:36:26	MichaelTunnell	shndns: no
2014-12-30 12:36:52	shndns	MichaelTunnell, no what??
2014-12-30 12:37:19	MichaelTunnell	Antergos uses Arch Repos and the AUR directly compatible with Arch...there is nothing extra added to those, however there is an extra repo that adds polish and some tools
2014-12-30 12:37:45	shndns	Yeah that's what I ment I shoulda been more clear.
2014-12-30 12:37:46	MichaelTunnell	the Antergos repo contains stuff like Themes, Icons, Fonts, etc and also includes Yaourt so AUR access is easier to gain
2014-12-30 12:38:03	marvelinti	As long as the security-stuff is arch-official it shouldn't matter :)
2014-12-30 12:38:18	shndns	I use it in arch for icons
2014-12-30 12:38:31	marvelinti	guess all the "numix-fonts-and-shiny-thingies" are on antergos-repo
2014-12-30 12:38:41	MichaelTunnell	marvelinti: everything is arch official...you dont have to use the Antergos repo at all... in fact if you were to install the Base version you wouldnt have anything Antergos at that point
2014-12-30 12:39:06	marvelinti	yep, i guess that "error" was linked to the numix-package update
2014-12-30 12:39:37	MichaelTunnell	I suppose it could be but that key is not specific to numix that I know of
2014-12-30 12:39:39	marvelinti	meaning that single package signed with an unknown key stopped the "upgrading"-process for all the others
2014-12-30 12:40:17	MichaelTunnell	the antergos-keyring package was rebuilt over the past month so it has caused a few issues
2014-12-30 12:40:25	MichaelTunnell	not sure if numix package is related or not
2014-12-30 12:42:00	marvelinti	btw. i don't know why but whenever i try to download the iso directly over the official antergos website there is always the message that: "a new version bla... is soon to be created etc.. etc.."
2014-12-30 12:42:11	marvelinti	and when i hit the "download"-button nothing happens
2014-12-30 12:42:37	marvelinti	have to get the image always over sourceforge.net, is that a known issue?
2014-12-30 12:42:46	marvelinti	)or some mirror)
2014-12-30 12:43:04	axaxs	did you read the message or stop at the etc etc point
2014-12-30 12:43:16	axaxs	it may contain useful link
2014-12-30 12:44:17	marvelinti	yea i've seen the build-server-link but i didnt directly find the "isos"
2014-12-30 12:44:33	marvelinti	i see how stupid i am x)
2014-12-30 12:44:37	axaxs	click testing on the build server,
2014-12-30 12:44:40	marvelinti	there it is, releases! :)
2014-12-30 12:44:41	axaxs	on the bottom left there
2014-12-30 12:44:46	marvelinti	and testing x)
2014-12-30 12:45:11	marvelinti	feeling quite stupid right now :)
2014-12-30 12:45:13	axaxs	should probably link that message on the download page straight there though, good idea
2014-12-30 12:45:21	axaxs	no no, it's not overly intuitive
2014-12-30 12:46:31	marvelinti	well everything's up-to-date now, and i also learned about the correct use of the build-server
2014-12-30 12:46:35	marvelinti	lets call it a day :D
2014-12-30 12:46:46	marvelinti	have a nice one,and thanks! :)
