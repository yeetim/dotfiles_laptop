2013-11-25 20:40:01	@Zenther	everyone has their own tastes, requirements, or desires of a distro.
2013-11-25 20:41:02	@Zenther	Best way to find out if it is for you is play with the live disks, install to virtualbox, or along side of the os you are using now. Try it out and see if it meets your needs.
2013-11-25 20:42:58	torei	To me I tend to flock to latest and greatest, I don't like using older software.  Therefore, Manjaro works for me.  I am tired of building arch or gentoo from scratch.
2013-11-25 20:44:13	@Zenther	But on the other hand... Brand new may mean bug filled as opposed to an older version patched up.
2013-11-25 20:44:51	@Zenther	... that brings stability and reliability...

2013-11-26 02:46:32	sharkbyte	Hello I have some major problems right now.
2013-11-26 02:49:15	sharkbyte	It all started with my attempt to install my network printer yesterday (which failed so far). As I booted this morning I became the message that some theme couldn´t be loaded because disk is full.  o.0  I could narrow it down to /var/log/cups errorlogs which had the size of over 19GB, on my 40GB SSD / . I could remove it as superuser and subsequently trimmed the drive.

2013-11-26 09:12:10	H-H-H	its an iso of the system im currently useing but is also an iso of my own manjaro respin :)
2013-11-26 09:13:19	Nytram	Oh! ok. I want to do an ISO of my current system so that in the event of a disaster it will install everything I have now, then all I need do is restore my personal stuff.
2013-11-26 09:13:57	Nytram	Easy enough to do, I'm just so lazy I've never gotten around to actually doing it.
2013-11-26 09:14:17	Nytram	I also have the attention span of a goldfish
2013-11-26 09:15:07	H-H-H	hehe same here but i also expect to much of my system and try to do to much at once then complain when it goes slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow lol
2013-11-26 09:15:56	Nytram	I'm a bit like that too, I start doing one thing then I see something else and it's "oooh! shiny thing" and I go off doing that
2013-11-26 09:16:19	Nytram	Before I know it I have seceral part completed tasks
2013-11-26 09:16:27	Nytram	*several

2013-11-26 09:21:15	H-H-H	i dont know ive never seen that maybe the cpu core is busy
2013-11-26 09:21:26	Nytram	Only happens in manjaro and it now takes about 4 minutes to boot up.
2013-11-26 09:21:44	H-H-H	ouch my system boots in under 10 seconds
2013-11-26 09:21:49	Nytram	Instead of less than one minute
2013-11-26 09:22:01	Nytram	10 seconds? oO
2013-11-26 09:22:13	Nytram	My post is longer than that
2013-11-26 09:22:38	Nytram	Although I do have 4 SATA devices

2013-11-27 16:22:30	sergioandvar_	 This is a bug in the program, and should never happen under normal
2013-11-27 16:22:31	sergioandvar_	 circumstances. A bug report and debugging data have been written
2013-11-27 16:22:31	sergioandvar_	 to this text file:
2013-11-27 16:23:46	Zenther	sergioandvar_, check in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Google_Earth
2013-11-27 16:24:04	Zenther	are you using catalyst?
2013-11-27 16:24:15	sergioandvar_	yes, i do
2013-11-27 16:24:26	sergioandvar_	what should i do?
2013-11-27 16:24:38	Zenther	you have to use google-earth6 until it is fixed. That is the issue right now
2013-11-27 16:25:04	Zenther	yaourt -S google-earth6
2013-11-27 16:25:31	sergioandvar_	What's the main difference between both versions? and what should i do to delete the broken version?
2013-11-27 16:25:53	Zenther	lets see you installed using what yaourt?
2013-11-27 16:26:09	Zenther	yaourt -R google-earth

2013-11-27 16:27:53	sergioandvar_	well, it is uninstalled. Do i have to 'yaourt -S google-earth6' to have Google Earth working?
2013-11-27 16:28:18	Zenther	yes, for you google-earth6 is the only version that will work currently

2013-11-28 09:43:07	outherist	and why is it I have to look for another distro because Carl left? What is this crap?
2013-11-28 09:44:50	outherist	He was happy creating. Something is smelly wrong here. And I want to know what it is.
2013-11-28 09:46:18	mips	you have no right to know anything and you can demand until you are blue in the face. what happend happened in private between the prject team, if any of the parties wanted you to know they would have made it public.
2013-11-28 09:47:02	mips	why do you need to look for another distro? I'm busy installing 0.8.8 right now on my laptop and next will be my desktop
2013-11-28 09:47:19	outherist	so how is life in redmond?
2013-11-28 09:47:33	outherist	this is bullshit! and you know it
2013-11-28 09:48:46	outherist	cause the core developer of my release went away. What happened with the open transparent manjaro that once was?
2013-11-28 09:48:54	Zenther	who cares... drama drama drama
2013-11-28 09:49:29	outherist	I didn't make the drama, I want to know why it exists, cause I hate the drama.
2013-11-28 09:50:00	Zenther	if you hate it, then ignore it
2013-11-28 09:50:16	blossoming	The people who say that they hate drama are usually those who dramawhore the most.

2013-11-28 09:51:15	outherist	asking what happened to a guy is drama? wow

2013-11-28 09:51:46	mips	outherist, probably roland/phillip as it was before 087

2013-11-28 09:53:47	outherist	so, openbox manjaro is dead then?
2013-11-28 09:55:29	Culinax	I don't think anyone knows the exact reason, except some members of the core/support team
2013-11-28 09:56:33	mips	outherist, like I said it will probably be maintained by roland/phil like it was before 0.8.7
2013-11-28 09:57:08	Esclapion	The configuration files are always available
2013-11-28 09:58:56	outherist	carl was the entire driver behind the openbox effort, and now he is gone, and all I get is bla bla. Something is up. I don't buy it. I can't be the only one asking questions.
2013-11-28 09:59:28	outherist	and the community is not as friendly as it once was.
2013-11-28 09:59:55	outherist	:)
2013-11-28 10:00:15	Culinax	Lol
2013-11-28 10:00:23	Esclapion	Carl decided it
2013-11-28 10:00:24	outherist	he was always smart, it's one of the reasons I'm querying
2013-11-28 10:01:33	Esclapion	Verander is gone out and back. Parmaster also. I hope the same for Carl.
2013-11-28 10:01:52	Esclapion	Oh, the little trol
2013-11-28 10:01:58	Esclapion	:)
2013-11-28 10:03:29	outherist	Yeah but you don't get out and back running a distro release, thats the difference.
2013-11-28 10:03:49	outherist	And who is running manjarobox now?
2013-11-28 10:04:38	blossoming	Why don't you stop asking if you're not happy with the answers you are getting?
2013-11-28 10:05:10	outherist	cause I'm not happy with the answers I'm getting ?
2013-11-28 10:05:24	outherist	is asking questions a crime around here now?
2013-11-28 10:06:11	Esclapion	No, I find that it's a pity for Carl, but what can we do ?
2013-11-28 10:06:14	outherist	this community has changed
2013-11-28 10:06:54	HardyH	Communities change when the distro gains popularity that's life
2013-11-28 10:07:10	outherist	so, no good bye blog post or forum post from carl?
2013-11-28 10:07:15	@Lukimya	I believe carl has done this before
2013-11-28 10:07:34	outherist	Lukimya: tell me more
2013-11-28 10:07:58	@Lukimya	well wasnt there a time where he was months out from the forum?
2013-11-28 10:08:03	outherist	HardyH: I am not new to linux, and this is not normal behaviour
2013-11-28 10:08:16	@Lukimya	he does not use it when he has better things to do
2013-11-28 10:08:21	HardyH	Define 'Normal' then
2013-11-28 10:09:05	outherist	he was working on a release and sometimes 2 , it's expected.
2013-11-28 10:09:29	outherist	HardyH: define defining
2013-11-28 10:09:58	blossoming	Yay, metarecursion.
2013-11-28 10:10:16	outherist	and all means nothing
2013-11-28 10:10:47	HardyH	I don't see a point in continuing to  discuss with you, outherist
2013-11-28 10:11:03	Zenther	outherist, here it is... it is an internal matter involving the two parties. If they wanted you to know, they would. Phil has picked up carl's duties and marching on with providing the best Linux distro possible. He has a vision and is continuing oh his plan of execution of it.
2013-11-28 10:11:10	blossoming	Did you see one in starting, HardyH?
2013-11-28 10:11:13	Zenther	Now drop it.
2013-11-28 10:11:19	outherist	HardyH: so tell me why carl left and you don't have to ;)
2013-11-28 10:11:26	@Lukimya	in all honesty, i think this was the only big change in what comes to the openbox release and he did that and now he has a break

2013-11-28 10:48:39	Nytram	I switched from ATI to nvidia purely vecause of Linux.
2013-11-28 10:48:49	Nytram	*because
2013-11-28 10:48:54	manjaro-peace	Zenther: well the issue on amd ati it's this : old card = you fucked only open driver will work

2013-11-28 10:49:54	Nytram	manjaro-peace: But do keep in mind it is not the fault of manjaro or linux, it is ATI who cause the problems... or rather, do not solve them.
2013-11-28 10:50:04	Zenther	nvidia is like that but there is old versions of the nvidia propitiatory drivers still available for those people.
2013-11-28 10:50:04	manjaro-peace	Nytram: sure
2013-11-28 10:50:25	manjaro-peace	Nytram: but the thing it's this i have kubuntu too and i have not this issue on flash video
2013-11-28 10:50:29	Nytram	proprietary. ;)
2013-11-28 10:50:31	manjaro-peace	it seems strange this

2013-11-29 10:46:55	@ringo32	its so hard to understand if you have multiple systems

I've just installed Manjaro - booted in to the live session, ran the installer and selected / to format and install there, formatted swap partition and selected home but didn't format that.

2013-12-01 09:31:38	alexisisis	mips1: ok so I've got to the partition page, it looks like the partitions were created when using the GUI installer. Do I make the / bootable?
2013-12-01 09:31:49	petko	Escalpion , do you happen to use clementine (music player)
2013-12-01 09:32:07	petko	*Esclapion
2013-12-01 09:32:21	mips1	alexisisis, is it a gui partioner or a cli/ncurses one?
2013-12-01 09:32:38	alexisisis	ncurses I think, just a terminal
2013-12-01 09:33:09	Esclapion	no. a lot, audacious, deadbeef, but not Clementine
2013-12-01 09:33:19	mips1	alexisisis, ok exit it back to the menu (dont exit the installer) and fire up gparted

2013-12-01 10:49:32	mips1	alexis-isis, 3.11 is end of life, move to 3.12
2013-12-01 10:49:54	alexis-isis	oh ok, will do then

2013-12-01 11:12:54	alexisisis	I see. edge226, that was my next question, I didn't mean to disable it completely, just not have it make me select it unless I need it. Setting to 0 works ok then?

2013-12-01 11:29:43	mips1	alexisisis very few ISPs offer their clients IPv6 connectivity so probably not.
2013-12-01 11:33:09	mips1	alexisisis no idea, i shy away from extra stuff that adds more memory/cpu load but the creator of that, Korrode, also does custom kernels which I run

2013-12-04 19:31:52	edge226	Zenther: that screen would suck imho. The fonts would be way too small for the size and you would have to jack the DPI and ruin your real estate. Too big for nice usage.

2013-12-04 19:50:58	edge226	The fact you can daisy chain more than 1 machine is what I think is awesome about it.
2013-12-04 19:51:14	edge226	what was that software. synergy or whatever. Would be great for a machine like that.
2013-12-04 19:51:35	@Zenther	maybe and ultra wide would suit me better... two apps side by side as I do anyway... instead of firefox 2/3 and hexchat 1/3 they would be 1/2 and 1/2 width.
2013-12-04 19:51:52	edge226	Zenther: exactly.
2013-12-04 19:52:06	edge226	a monitor that wide is not really meant for full screen.
2013-12-04 19:52:33	edge226	even 4x apps @ 1/4 each could be good with that much desktop realestate.
2013-12-04 19:52:59	@Zenther	browser windows, editors etc, just look funny full screen width on a normal wide screen to me.
2013-12-04 19:53:35	edge226	Zenther: they probably do look funny that big lol.
2013-12-04 19:53:43	@Zenther	edge226, actually my right third is hexchat top half, bottom right is left open for teminal windows I use from time to time
2013-12-04 19:54:21	edge226	Zenther: thats nearly 2x my current monitor width lol.

2013-12-04 20:09:53	edge226	Zenther: 1360 x 768 is such a stupid resolution, its surprizing how many games do not support it lol.
2013-12-04 20:10:53	gpsychosis	Is that 16:10 or :9?
2013-12-04 20:12:42	edge226	its 16:9 I believe.
2013-12-04 20:14:11	edge226	Zenther: hmmm,  you have lfd2?
2013-12-04 20:14:34	gpsychosis	With such a low vertical resolution, I'm sure you have a generous side panel (that is, if you even use a GUI)
2013-12-04 20:15:21	@Zenther	that is an odd size, doesn't even have a letter designation for it... as in VGA, QVGA, PAL< SVGA, HVGA, WXGA, and so on...
2013-12-04 20:15:52	@Zenther	edge226, yes I do, only steam game I have
2013-12-04 20:15:54	@Zenther	LOL
2013-12-04 20:16:22	edge226	hmmm, you ever play it?
2013-12-04 20:16:35	@Zenther	all the time...except the last week or so
2013-12-04 20:16:52	@Zenther	I get on there and wonder where the last 8 hours went... LOL

2013-12-04 20:17:25	edge226	Zenther: I own it but never play it. Total time played 10 mins. Maybe we should start a manjaro LFD2 group lol

2013-12-04 20:20:06	@Zenther	not teamspeak ...
2013-12-04 20:20:13	@Zenther	or whatever it is called
2013-12-04 20:21:15	edge226	Zenther: generally the 'gamer' ones arent needed for just a few people. Usually for MMO's its ventrillo or teamspeak. I prefer to use a linux alternative.

2013-12-04 20:22:46	edge226	Zenther: have you done the steam sound test?
2013-12-04 20:23:13	@Zenther	there was an update where it worked for about one week, then I remember a problem with no sound at all... another update and had sound but then my mic didn't work... something like that
2013-12-04 20:23:27	@Zenther	edge226, yes, works in steam
2013-12-04 20:23:59	edge226	Zenther: did you report it?

2013-12-04 20:24:09	edge226	Zenther: I see.
2013-12-04 20:24:19	edge226	I am just DL the game now. Ill have to test it.
2013-12-04 20:24:21	ghost^	mumble is another VC .. open source
2013-12-04 20:24:28	edge226	ghost^: true.
2013-12-04 20:24:48	edge226	Zenther: I suppose we could use the LDC's mumble server lol.
2013-12-04 20:24:56	@Zenther	mumble, that's the one I couldn't remember... people left teamspeak for that one I think
2013-12-04 20:25:47	@Zenther	never used either one and someone would have to hold my hand setting it up and how to use it... LOL
2013-12-04 20:25:52	edge226	Zenther: it would be a simple task to ask for a LFD2 gaming room.
2013-12-04 20:30:28	@Zenther	I wonder if I should try to get my motheboards intel HD4600 GPU working... failed last time I tried...
2013-12-04 20:31:08	@Zenther	would be nice having TV on it's own GPU

2013-12-04 21:12:09	torei	edge226: I love everything about the game, the concept is the greatest part.  Open sandbox you can pretty much do anything you want, the character progression is well done as well
2013-12-04 21:12:35	torei	silver/grey had no choice the jagstore only had one in stock
2013-12-04 21:12:47	edge226	torei: sandbox can mean a lot of things in a game. What makes it unique and good?
2013-12-04 21:13:07	@Zenther	still nice... I think the red/black one is just releasing now

2013-12-04 21:30:38	torei	Zenther: I look at previous edition pricing, which was very pricey almost 1300USD
2013-12-04 21:30:43	@Zenther	never really tried... 4.2 was easy using the asus auto overclock thingy in windows

2013-12-05 02:41:09	@ringo32	qwebirc5003, ok wiki is not full sized but why this words ?
2013-12-05 02:42:11	qwebirc5003	@AHD73...doesn't start on my machine
2013-12-05 02:43:19	qwebirc5003	@ring32 it needs to be flushed down the toilet. Every section I've read has outdated and useless info. Archive the current wiki and create one that actually works with 0.8.8 since that's the version being promoted.
2013-12-05 02:43:23	AHD73	yea.. just noticed the the applet does nothing
2013-12-05 02:43:46	@ringo32	Manjaro is not an version based distro
2013-12-05 02:44:04	qwebirc5003	i loathe using my touchpad when I have a nice bluetooth mouse that works easily in EVERY OTHER DISTRO BUT THIS ONE
2013-12-05 02:44:07	@ringo32	the iso 0.88 shows latest snapshot on the iso nothing more

2013-12-05 02:44:45	qwebirc5003	still doesn't mean that the procedures stop getting updated.
2013-12-05 02:45:07	@ringo32	but doesnt mean hat the whole wiki is outdated
2013-12-05 02:45:09	qwebirc5003	if that's the case then just tell everyone they are on there on with this distro and delete the useless wiki
2013-12-05 02:45:15	@ringo32	a part ok not as a whole
2013-12-05 02:45:24	qwebirc5003	on their own
2013-12-05 02:45:36	@ringo32	i should say rewrite it then

2013-12-05 17:27:37	edge226	qwebirc52068: as I said I am not even sure whats wrong. You have given no info other than 'cant update' and I have little time atm to actually troubleshoot it anyways. But without pastebins of the messages. "it doesnt work" is useless.
2013-12-05 17:27:41	qwebirc52068	such as thru the  update manager or sudo

2013-12-05 17:30:16	edge226	qwebirc52068: I dont have time to fix your issue. Give pastebin info the the channel for starters. we need to know 'why' its not updating. What its telling you is going wrong. Otherwise we are left to assume whats going wrong which could be nearly anything to do with any package...
2013-12-05 17:31:09	qwebirc52068	hmmm

2013-12-06 07:54:26	Zenther	yea... nothing there to fix that issue.
2013-12-06 07:54:30	HardyH	There's some kind of graphical tool to set up multiple displays
2013-12-06 07:54:53	Zenther	I also have an issued becuase both monitors use different resolutions.
2013-12-06 07:55:30	Zenther	my computer monitor is just 1680x1050 and not 1920x1080 like my TV is.

2013-12-06 07:58:55	HardyH	Nvidia-settings offers an overscan option
2013-12-06 07:58:56	Zenther	not really a window since it is full screen but that is how they word it.
2013-12-06 07:59:56	Zenther	just figured if it was on it's own xorg using the intel it would be perfect as it only deals with it's own resolutions and monitor.

2013-12-06 08:48:12	qwebirc17649	Hi, I'm having a problem with a Manjaro install on a SSD.  I followed the guide, but when it comes time to boot from the drive it just doesn't.  If I boot to the manjaro install CD and choose Boot from Hard Disk it boots just fine.  Any suggestions?

2013-12-06 14:22:45	blossoming	marcpv: what are you using
2013-12-06 14:22:48	@ringo32	hehh jeah ;à
2013-12-06 14:22:50	Nytram	Ah! xfce?
2013-12-06 14:23:10	marcpv	blossoming: manjaro 0.8.8 xfce
2013-12-06 14:23:33	blossoming	In which case I can't help

2013-12-06 14:23:40	blossoming	But I'm sure ringo32 can.
2013-12-06 14:24:31	marcpv	blossoming: thanks anyway
2013-12-06 14:24:47	@ringo32	go too xfce4-settings and to keyboard -settings
2013-12-06 14:26:33	@ringo32	second tab  you see a list where you can change the key settings
2013-12-06 14:27:01	marcpv	ringo32: there it is, thanks very much! what a shame, that's too easy...
2013-12-06 14:27:16	@ringo32	no shame is al ok :)
2013-12-06 14:27:38	Nytram	At least you can run manjaro. 8/
2013-12-06 14:28:17	@ringo32	i have manjaro reinstalled on my son pc
2013-12-06 14:28:23	@ringo32	bloody fast :)
2013-12-06 14:28:46	marcpv	I just installed it... yeah, bloody fast, specially compared with mint 15 cinnamon
2013-12-06 14:28:46	@ringo32	i need to unbloat my manjaro ..pfff
2013-12-06 14:29:19	@ringo32	personally mint will drop xfce in future .. shame your self mint :)

2013-12-06 14:31:32	Nytram	Why so ringo32? Mint have a fantastive DE in Cinnamon. Admittedly they 'could' keep xfce as a focussed de but ppl can really easily install it themselves if they want. /shrug
2013-12-06 14:32:41	@ringo32	a clean iso is always better :)i dont know xfce came later and later LMDE got now only cinnamon and mate
2013-12-06 14:33:41	marcpv	mint 16 xfce will be like 5 month of support, thats a shame... better use solydx or manjaro (better for me)

2013-12-06 16:21:50	@ringo32	have heard it on channel you have different type off rolling dont know but only i know is now they update to the next freeze version with out ruine te home map  and files
2013-12-06 16:22:49	edge226	ringo32: them updating how the packages are updated within there release cycle versions does not make it rolling.
2013-12-06 16:23:13	edge226	ringo32: they dont get new packages as they come out. It does not constantly change. It stays static for a limited ammount of time.
2013-12-06 16:24:02	@ringo32	rolling is just a spread words , cyclerolling partlyrolling pfff a list more
2013-12-06 16:24:34	edge226	ringo32: calling it something its not does not change what it is though.

2013-12-06 21:15:23	ghost^	what is the prefered way to deal with optdeps, install with --asdep flag? and do i need to reinstall a package if i install optdep after the fact?
2013-12-06 21:17:18	@Zenther	I just install packages from command line... it will tell you the optionals when it installs and which ones are already installed...
2013-12-06 21:17:48	@Zenther	if you want you can then install them... no reason to re-install the original package.
2013-12-06 21:19:05	ghost^	ok, so it will just pickup that they are installed, no need to reconfigure as if you installed from source.. good
2013-12-06 21:19:22	@Zenther	no need
2013-12-06 21:20:17	@Zenther	really no configuration on installing packages... it places and generic.conf file there but does not configure it.
2013-12-06 21:20:39	@Zenther	not like debs do in ubuntu/mint/etc

2013-12-06 21:23:14	@Zenther	just sudo -S packagename
2013-12-06 21:23:17	@Zenther	all there is to it
2013-12-06 21:24:10	@Zenther	if you want the optional do those separate after it told you about them during the original package install
2013-12-06 21:25:04	ghost^	ok, cool
2013-12-06 21:25:12	ghost^	thanks for clearing that up Zenther ;)
2013-12-06 21:25:47	@Zenther	or if you know them beforehand you can sudo pacman -S originalpackage opt1 opt2...
2013-12-06 21:25:57	@Zenther	all at the same time
2013-12-06 21:26:05	ghost^	right

2013-12-07 05:29:54	qwebirc3115	w.c distro should i get from this http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install_wizard/index.html
2013-12-07 05:30:08	ariscop	qwebirc3115, it was made from scratch, not based on an existing distro, also theres an hplip package so you don't need to download it yourself
2013-12-07 05:30:13	qwebirc60902	ciao zamn900 ho un problema, sto intallando maj con desktop gnome ma l'installazione rimane ferma allo 0% con una scritta rossa sotto "l'installazione...il metodo "advanced""

2013-12-07 05:30:51	ariscop	qwebirc3115, yaourt -S hplip

2013-12-07 05:31:05	qwebirc3115	mean*?

2013-12-07 05:32:15	@ringo32	why yaourt ?
2013-12-07 05:32:29	ariscop	ringo32, it handles sudo
2013-12-07 05:32:35	zamn900	qwebirc60902, stai installando usando il terminale?
2013-12-07 05:32:44	zamn900	non l'ho mai fatto
2013-12-07 05:32:46	@ringo32	its in repo :) sudo is not bad

2013-12-07 05:33:10	zamn900	quindi quello col terminale
2013-12-07 05:33:17	ariscop	ringo32, nothing wrong with sudo, it's just easier to explain yaourt -S than sudo pacman -S
2013-12-07 05:34:15	zamn900	se è con gui credo il problema sia imputabile al file iso probabilmente corrotto/danneggiato

2013-12-07 05:38:19	qwebirc60902	zamn900: no è la prima volta che provo, non capisco perche sotto la barra di avanzamento c'è la seguente scritta ROSSA "l'installer verrà utilizzato il metodo "advanced""

2013-12-07 05:39:27	@ringo32	but hplip is standard installed normal
2013-12-07 05:39:47	ariscop	Culinax, i'll avoid recomending yaourt in the future then
2013-12-07 05:40:29	qwebirc60902	zamn900:  il file ".setup-running" c'è solo una riga con scritto "Thus 1234" qualche idea?
2013-12-07 05:40:46	Culinax	ariscop: Well, you don't have to avoid recommending yaourt, but packages in the official repo should be installed with pacman, AUR packages with yaourt
2013-12-07 05:41:14	zamn900	ringo32, qwebirc60902 is having problem with usblive installer with gui it's saying highlightend in red under that installer is going to use advanced method

2013-12-07 08:42:21	AHD73	...on that topic: what does "manjaro-system 2013.." do?
2013-12-07 08:42:28	alexisisis	how can I display asian font characters in firefox? I noticed they just show up and boxes with numbers inside them
2013-12-07 08:43:18	Zenther	AHD73, you ever run arch and had to manually do things when updating?

2013-12-07 08:46:26	AHD73	then alexisisis, there is an update.. just today :D
2013-12-07 08:47:30	alexisisis	oh really? Exciting!
2013-12-07 08:48:13	AHD73	haha, yea.. it said it fixed some mdm theme issues..
2013-12-07 08:48:43	AHD73	now the rest of the shit is arriving..
2013-12-07 08:49:41	Zenther	yup, there was mdm, mdm-themes, and now mdm-themes-extra package, if you had just the one it will automatically download mdm-themes-extra so you can still log in... otherwise it will say it couldn't find your theme as they split that package into two packages.
2013-12-07 08:50:05	AHD73	aha..
2013-12-07 08:50:38	Zenther	I found that problem a couple days ago. I had to manually fix my machine. I reported it to philm and he included the fix in manjaro-system so you didn't have to do it. It did it for you.
2013-12-07 08:50:56	AHD73	hehe, thanks man!
2013-12-07 08:51:05	Zenther	So now you really know what that file does. LOL
2013-12-07 08:52:05	Zenther	I was left at an error window on login screen. Click OK, goes away but black screen and a mouse cursor... nothing you can do there... LOL
2013-12-07 08:52:15	alexisisis	I'm not picking up any updates. What is mdm?
2013-12-07 08:52:20	alexisisis	display manager?
2013-12-07 08:52:21	Zenther	could not log in
2013-12-07 08:52:45	Zenther	mint display manager... a login window when you boot up before it goes to your desktop.
2013-12-07 08:53:10	AHD73	yea.. and it has to pimped and stuff.. so you can login with eye candy
2013-12-07 08:53:48	alexisisis	oh right
2013-12-07 08:54:46	AHD73	ugh.. looks like it trashed the virtual box installation :P

2013-12-08 12:12:45	alexisisis	I've installed compiz for xfce and got it working but I can't get cube to work. I have it enabled and set up according to some tutorials i looked over but when I do the shortcut the whole screen flips horizontally rather than go to a cube
2013-12-08 12:13:49	HardyH	Most probably an issue with the number of desktops you have set
2013-12-08 12:13:54	@ringo32	hmmm in www.manjaro.be/irc i have some video links :) well what kind of gpu?
2013-12-08 12:14:23	alexisisis	HardyH, how many do I need, 6?
2013-12-08 12:14:35	HardyH	Four
2013-12-08 12:14:38	HardyH	In oen row
2013-12-08 12:14:43	HardyH	one row even
2013-12-08 12:14:53	alexisisis	ringo32, not sure AMD/ATI RV710/M92 [Mobility Radeon HD 4330/4350/4550]
2013-12-08 12:15:32	HardyH	The settings for the number of desktrops are a little hidden in ccsm
2013-12-08 12:16:13	alexisisis	I can see the number of desktops but not rows. Is that H & V virtual size?
2013-12-08 12:16:36	HardyH	Yes make vertical size 1 and horizontal 4

2013-12-08 12:19:17	HardyH	Guess you only had two virtual desktops before
2013-12-08 12:19:28	alexisisis	yeah think so
2013-12-08 12:20:31	alexisisis	how do you get it so you can see all sides of the cube? At the moment I can see the corner when I change but it's not like a proper cube I've seen in screenshots with a different background
2013-12-08 12:21:48	HardyH	I guess you mean the skydome theme
2013-12-08 12:22:45	HardyH	You can set that too in ccsm
2013-12-08 12:22:57	HardyH	Desktop Cube/Appearance
2013-12-08 12:24:05	alexisisis	ah yeah that's it but the cube just changes from one desktop to another, doesn't actually show a cube, like smaller than the desktop itself
2013-12-08 12:25:56	HardyH	Then you should try to play around with  all these cube settings
2013-12-08 12:26:34	alexisisis	ok thanks
2013-12-08 12:27:45	HardyH	And I guess there are some tutorials too somewher  in the depths of the web

2013-12-10 10:58:41	manjaro_user	Just wanted to say...current Kubuntu user giving Manjaro 0.8.8 a live spin, very nice, slick
2013-12-10 10:58:58	manjaro_user	very polished
2013-12-10 10:59:15	manjaro_user	suprised at the LACK of bugs
2013-12-10 10:59:20	HardyH	I use MATE, but I like the look of Manjaro KDE too
2013-12-10 10:59:49	raleeha	hi
2013-12-10 10:59:56	HardyH	And of course there are no bugs ;)
2013-12-10 11:00:06	manjaro_user	I've been contemplating a Kubuntu replacement, this could possibly be it
2013-12-10 11:00:32	manjaro_user	reading Distrowatch comments lead me here :D

2013-12-10 11:01:54	HardyH	Sorry 0.8 r3
2013-12-10 11:02:05	manjaro_user	Love KDE but Kubuntu has Ubuntu under the hood, not like the path Ubuntu is taking
2013-12-10 11:02:10	HardyH	No stability issues here with MATE
2013-12-10 11:02:24	Linuxkartoffel	HardyH: in #manjaro is somebody that looks for the desktop settings in mate.
2013-12-10 11:02:31	Linuxkartoffel	maybe you can explain it better then me.
