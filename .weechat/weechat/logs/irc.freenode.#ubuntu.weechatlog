2014-02-08 09:11:52	USBman	Hello, I am trying to install Ubuntu on to an 8GB USB stick, but it keeps giving me a bunch of errors at different points. If I try a very basic install, no encryption, it tells me "You need to make this partition bigger than the amount below / 3.2 GB" Which when I open the partition manager, it shows that the install program only allocated it 2.4 GB...
2014-02-08 09:11:55	OerHeks	could be your host interferring
2014-02-08 09:12:12	BlueShark	OerHeks, Tried that already and it outputs nothing
2014-02-08 09:12:21	USBman	I started with 7.7GB of unallocated space.
2014-02-08 09:12:51	BlueShark	hitsujiTMO, okay, that doesn't output anything either. I changed 80 to a different port number and it outputs results.
2014-02-08 09:13:29	BlueShark	OerHeks, "host interfering" - Could you explain? I recently upgraded my Ubuntu version to 13.10 and this problem started after doing so.

If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

2014-02-09 12:53:18	tomreyn	gmachine_24: the major issue in wiping SSDs is that they're too intelligent. they have a controller which is basically a mini computer in your computer, whose task is make sure all the data which needs to get written is written to a block which is still in good condition. wear levelling is a problem there so the firmware of these drives needs to decide where to put data in an intelligent way. unfortunately this also means the operating system can
2014-02-09 12:53:18	tomreyn	't really know where exactly the data is going and can't ensure that it will be writing to a specific physical location on the SSD. so the operating system can hardly wipe it clean.
2014-02-09 12:53:34	tomreyn	or not reliably.

2014-02-09 12:53:46	hitsujiTMO	gmachine_24: different ssd's and thumbdrives have different implementations of wear leveling that can interfere with guaranteeing a complete wipe. Many have more space than advertised as they drop the use of bad blocks when write fails happen and stillretain their full space. if this is the implementation of the ssd you have, then even zeroing the full drive wont wipe every trace of whatever was written to it. you also can't rely on trim, a
2014-02-09 12:53:46	hitsujiTMO	s it doens't zero an unused block, it just preps it for a write

The hardware issue causes the linkdrop when the computer is in any way jogged, but something software is preventing it from disconnecting until I reboot. Is it possible to manually reboot *just* the driver or something like that?

That has to have root access of course.

2014-02-10 09:22:32	ubottu	gravyandfries: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.

I've deleted all large files. Checking disk usage, my home folder implies I'm using the full 30 gig. My home folder appears to imply otherwise. Any clues?
2014-02-10 10:18:25	daftykins	gravyandfries: once you've done that - you need a service to actually be running and open externally to the internet, so others can reach it. for example a web server. this will require port forwarding on the router.

2014-02-10 17:40:45	SourceSlayer	So I switched to a text session "sudo shutdown now", as it began to shutdown, Ubuntu started listing things it was shutting down, so I began to type random nonsense into the keyboard and this apparently canceled the shutdown, X11 wasn't running but I was suddenly the root user. Is that a security flaw?

2014-02-11 20:53:25	MACscr	i dont think so
2014-02-11 20:53:28	qin	mitchelwb: instead of reinstalling use live usb, so you will keep some chances of recovery missing files
2014-02-11 20:53:40	mitchelwb	qin, that's what I've been using.  testdisk comes with a utility called photorec that allows you to search and recover files.
2014-02-11 20:54:11	mitchelwb	qin, I've not done it via usb, is there a difference between usb and cd?

2014-02-12 00:06:22	ocx	Hi, i have an ubuntu system 12.04 to which students can come and plug in their usb sticks. When the usb stick is plugged for the first time it gets assigned partition 1 on /media/usb1 and partition 2 on /media/usb2, now if the usb is removed and replugged sometimes partition1 goes into /media/usb2 and partition2 goes into /media/usb1. Usb sticks cannot be identified since any kind of usb stick can be brought by any student,we dont have 
2014-02-12 00:06:29	ocx	What we want to achieve is when the usb stick is replugged, the partitions need to be mapped as they were initially mapped on the first initial usb insertion. Thank you

And that memory + SWAP. So from "man top" looks like its "RES" and "SWAP". I see RES, but there is no SWAP and google says never will be. So what software i can use for that?

2014-02-12 03:51:47	ubottu	slick: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use the !Unity desktop environment by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown.

2014-02-13 20:28:16	somsip	z1haze: as we discussed the other day, you can fix all of these by hand, but it is a long and laborious proces.s I know you have difficulties with reinstalling, but essentially you have b0rked the server in terms of functionality and security. If you do find someone who will walk you through this step by step, I'd encourage you to do this in private messaging.

2014-02-13 20:32:13	Flat4ForLife	Barrin6, yes you can do that. may i ask why you would not want to reinstall onto a new HD such as a SSD for better performance since it is a new computer?
2014-02-13 20:32:36	Barrin6	I guess I could just copy the stuff from the HD into the SSD? Would that work?
2014-02-13 20:32:44	somsip	Barrin6: I'd go with it. I have moved harddrives to new mobo/CPU combinations before with no problems. And had an external HD installtion which worked on more than one different PC. If it fails, nothing lost if reinstalling is an option you are happy to take. Reinstall may be cleaner, admittedly

2014-02-13 20:47:28	Akiva-Mobile	Flat4ForLife: if he does not know which ones though need changing to which set of instructions, I dare say he is fit for a reinstall
2014-02-13 20:47:34	somsip	Akiva-Mobile: that's the point. He needs a clean system to compare against. Which will be laborious. I've suggested he install a VM clean, then check them off himself against that, or that interesting apt-get --reinstall install < dpkg --get-selections link I posted earlier
