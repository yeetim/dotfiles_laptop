2015-06-06 12:46:16	msjche	apexbang: my pleasure :)
2015-06-06 12:48:45	apexbang	maybe a suggestion for a next vid or so, since i've never understood it completely with gentoo, troubleshooting failed builds & maybe applying patches for ebuilds to fix them
2015-06-06 13:32:36	msjche	we
2015-06-06 13:33:14	msjche	we'll see, i'm not currently using gentoo, so maybe on the next build i'll do something like what das gregor and kaddy are doing
2015-06-06 13:34:37	apexbang	oh, well :) maybe when you come back to gentoo then, good luck with whatever it is that you're doing anyways
