2015-03-02 07:45:24	Ring0`	stfn: so meta-ctrl-?
2015-03-02 07:45:26	Alissa	ctrl-? /input delete_previous_char
2015-03-02 07:45:30	Alissa	Yes.

2015-03-02 12:29:00	GermainZ	(If not, does that mean that messages can be sent out of order?)
2015-03-02 12:29:26	grawity	GermainZ: in IRC generally – no
2015-03-02 12:29:46	grawity	GermainZ: ZNC and Weechat support the 'server-time' extension which adds timestamps though
2015-03-02 12:29:47	GermainZ	grawity: so consecutive messages can be sent out of order?
2015-03-02 12:30:06	grawity	GermainZ: (it's used for replaying "offline" messages)
2015-03-02 12:30:12	GermainZ	grawity: ah, I'm talking about you sending messages, not the other way around
2015-03-02 12:30:27	grawity	GermainZ: ah, no, no timestamps at all.
2015-03-02 12:30:50	GermainZ	So WeeChat probably queues them up since I've never seen them unordered
2015-03-02 12:30:54	GermainZ	Cool, thanks
2015-03-02 12:31:14	grawity	GermainZ: yeah, pretty much all clients have a plain first-in/last-out queue
2015-03-02 12:31:22	@FlashCode	GermainZ: weechat has an ordered queue for outgoing messages
2015-03-02 12:31:34	grawity	GermainZ: and most ircds (all?) work with a single-threaded event loop, which also preserves order
2015-03-02 12:31:57	GermainZ	Ah, thank you

2015-03-02 20:34:25	taron	I recommend searching in iset, and there are a couple scripts out there to show you all the possible colors in your terminal.
2015-03-02 20:34:44	taron	https://github.com/necrobuffalo/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/tmux_colours is the one I use, or a friend wrote an npm module called 256colors if you're into that sort of thing.
2015-03-02 20:34:53	ser_berry	it doesn't really make sense to individually set all the nick list colors
2015-03-02 20:34:59	ser_berry	I didn't have to do that with this client
2015-03-02 20:35:21	taron	curious what you mean by that?
2015-03-02 20:35:55	ser_berry	in my other client it seems to be only using 16 colors even though the top of colors says 256 are available
2015-03-02 20:36:12	ser_berry	I'm expecting the nick list to use all of those colors
2015-03-02 20:36:15	tekkbuzz	I had to set mine all manually but now I have the colors I how I like them.
2015-03-02 20:36:32	ser_berry	ah hmm I probably didn't set the color list on that client
2015-03-02 20:36:55	taron	What tekkbuzz said. 256colors in that window just means 256colors are available, doesn't mean you're using all 256, or anything other than the 16 available by default.
2015-03-02 20:37:09	ser_berry	yeah
2015-03-02 20:38:18	taron	I also personally find the /color buffer a bit misleading, cause in order to set the colors you have to set things like weechat.bar.nicklist.color_fg rather than set things in that window.
2015-03-02 20:38:37	ser_berry	yep it was weechat.color.chat_nick_colors
2015-03-02 20:38:44	ser_berry	I forgot I had to set that
2015-03-02 20:38:52	taron	heh, that'd explain it
2015-03-02 20:39:06	ser_berry	by default there is a really dark blue I can't even read

2015-03-04 17:27:18	zerwas	CissWit: why?
2015-03-04 17:29:46	CissWit	it opens so many vulnerabilities ! padding oracle, cbc bit flipping. CBC is one of the cause of the famous BEAST SSL vulnerability for example
2015-03-04 17:30:06	zerwas	Yeah, I know about BEAST. But is there a better encryption for IRC?
2015-03-04 17:30:32	zerwas	Or do you know about any better encrypted group chat options?
2015-03-04 17:31:50	CissWit	no, sorry. I just wanted to notice that CBC, even if better than ECB in most case, is hard to use properly
2015-03-04 17:34:54	gb	zerwas: yes in dev
2015-03-04 17:36:31	gb	!roadmap describes features being introduced already in weechat better then i

2015-03-04 17:40:30	gb	given i do not use/or care about pointless encryption method's for irc i am hardly supeised it is not therer
2015-03-04 17:41:50	CissWit	zerwas: there are two weechat scripts, one in python and one in ruby that support the FiSH encryption (the ecb mode)
2015-03-04 17:42:08	CissWit	implementing cbc is not that hard starting from those if you want to take some time on the plugin
2015-03-04 17:42:18	CissWit	otherwise, it seams there are no solution for you
2015-03-04 17:42:31	gb	you are probably free to write a script/submit it for your davourite encryption protocol or lodge a feature request for it but flash is pretty busy adding real features too wee
2015-03-04 17:43:51	CissWit	zerwas: talking about better encrypted group chat options, https://code.google.com/p/mirc-gpg/ this for mirc looks like a better approach
2015-03-04 17:45:05	gb	hahaha if you like encryption from 20years ago sure, cause google has a massive storehouse of pointless archives
2015-03-04 17:45:54	CissWit	how is gpg 20 years ago encryption ?

While the mall owner (read: the server's staff) might control some of the shops (read: channels), most of them are 'owned' (registered) by individual parties (channel founders). Each of the shops (channels) usually has their own subject/topic of conversation and their own rules and guidelines. All of
2015-03-04 21:06:34	FiXato	the shops (channels) can be reached via the main entrance (any IRC client connecting to the server's address), some of them might have their own entrance (an IRC applet/client on their own website). So, the fact that you have connected through website X about subject Y, doesn't mean all other channels belong to the same website / share the same topic of conversation.

2015-03-07 06:59:40	@FlashCode	mpa984: you can, but with different weechat home directory
2015-03-07 06:59:49	@FlashCode	otherwise configs & logs would overwrite each others
2015-03-07 06:59:57	mpa984	oh ok
2015-03-07 07:00:02	@FlashCode	it would be better to use /window split inside weechat
2015-03-07 07:00:12	@FlashCode	so you can run only one weechat with different buffers side by side

2015-03-07 07:02:40	@FlashCode	you can only do that inside weechat itself
2015-03-07 07:03:04	@FlashCode	try /window splitv (or /window splith)
2015-03-07 07:03:21	@FlashCode	/window merge  to close the new window

2015-03-08 10:43:04	polyzen	well, it doesn't even restore chanmon's buffer to that window
2015-03-08 10:43:22	polyzen	alt+2, alt+w, alt+up every weechat start :|
2015-03-08 10:43:24	sim642	I just have my layout saved and that has worked

2015-03-08 10:43:55	nico2	maybe because i wanted at the botton and when i splitted I made splith 85
2015-03-08 10:43:57	sim642	if you save your layout while focused in the window you want, maybe it will be like that on loading
2015-03-08 10:44:17	polyzen	pretty sure i've tried that at least a couple times

2015-03-08 12:12:47	GreeningGalaxy	hi, I'm trying to figure out how to make wrapping message text align against the line dividing the nicks from the message text (as opposed to the left edge of the terminal) the way IRSSI does.

2015-03-08 12:13:29	grawity	uh, "against the line dividing the nicks from the message text" + "the way IRSSI does"?
2015-03-08 12:13:40	grawity	that's a) Weechat's default setting, b) the opposite of what Irssi does
2015-03-08 12:14:02	GreeningGalaxy	i'm using IRSSI right now, and the text on wrapped lines doesn't go further to the left than the end of the nick.
2015-03-08 12:14:29	GreeningGalaxy	on weechat, wrapped lines go all the way to the wall, which makes them hard to read because they get all mixed up with the nicks.

2015-03-08 23:44:07	sjoshi	FlashCode: I forgot to note down the name of the package it took as dependency
2015-03-08 23:44:19	@FlashCode	libv8-dev for javascript plugin
2015-03-08 23:44:20	sjoshi	i am on ubuntu14.10 and upgrading weechat today brought up that
2015-03-08 23:44:25	sjoshi	FlashCode: Yup!
2015-03-08 23:44:29	sjoshi	ok
2015-03-08 23:44:54	sjoshi	We have something fancy in weechat related to Javascript :)
2015-03-08 23:44:56	sjoshi	?
2015-03-08 23:45:23	Yaniel	soon: weequery.js, nodechat.js
2015-03-08 23:45:58	firebird	cubechat.js (turns weechat into a spinning cube or something) :P
2015-03-08 23:46:16	sjoshi	any links to read about these new features, what are they going to do ?
2015-03-08 23:46:20	Yaniel	weechat really nees Würfel mode
2015-03-08 23:46:23	Yaniel	needs*
2015-03-08 23:46:59	 *	sjoshi quickly opens weechat.org to read roadmap :)
2015-03-08 23:47:04	firebird	sjoshi, it's a new plugin to allow javascript scripts, not unlike the already there plugins for lua, python, perl, ruby, guile, etc.
2015-03-08 23:47:32	firebird	not sure there's many, if any, links about this new plugin, it is *very* new afterall.
2015-03-08 23:47:50	firebird	perhaps at some point FlashCode will have a post on the blog about it or something.
2015-03-08 23:48:15	Yaniel	for the next stable release if not earlier
2015-03-08 23:48:25	sjoshi	firebird: ok, thanks for the information
2015-03-08 23:48:36	@FlashCode	firebird: yes I'll post on dev.weechat.org this evening
2015-03-08 23:48:46	@FlashCode	I already announced the plugin on Google+
2015-03-08 23:50:09	jeaye	weechat's (1.1.1) memory usage is slowly, yet steadily, growing and has been for over a week. I have weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number set to 1024. Is there a good way to determine what specific system is using what memory?
2015-03-08 23:50:15	jeaye	That is, buffers, or plugins (and which plugin), etc.
2015-03-08 23:50:57	@FlashCode	jeaye: most of times, memory is used by scripts
2015-03-08 23:51:01	@FlashCode	but it's hard to know which one
2015-03-08 23:51:24	@FlashCode	weechat itself don't use a lot of memory and it should not grow a lot if you have default/sane settings about history
2015-03-08 23:52:08	@FlashCode	jeaye: some timps here: https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_faq.en.html#memory_usage
2015-03-08 23:52:16	jeaye	FlashCode: I've been there.
2015-03-08 23:52:21	@FlashCode	but if memory grows, the main tip is to unload scripts one by one
2015-03-08 23:52:26	jeaye	Mmk.

2015-03-08 23:54:42	@FlashCode	and if you find it, please report it
2015-03-08 23:55:18	jeaye	Will do. For good  measure, also upgrading.

2015-03-09 13:23:40	infrablack	all of my channels have joins,parts disabled except one channel.. how can I make that one channel have that option disabled too?
2015-03-09 13:23:52	infrablack	I thought they were all disabled.. not sure why that one channel is different
2015-03-09 13:23:55	+weebot	-git(core)- FlashCode: doc: capitalize name of plugins in lists (scripting guide)

2015-03-09 13:27:04	freeroute	infrablack: also on that channel? IIRC you can set smartfilter per buffer as well.

2015-03-09 17:01:01	freeroute	had to set irc.server.freenode.ssl_dhkey_size to 1024 instead of 2048

2015-03-09 17:03:59	freeroute	I remember that it used to be 1024 here, but a while now they allowed higher values.
2015-03-09 17:04:17	macker	this confused me at first too bc I thought everything was stored ina  flat single config
2015-03-09 17:04:38	freeroute	no, it's getting stored in multiple

2015-03-09 20:18:05	gb	weethomas: you were probably told this last time as well but /help trigger is probably a good way to modify notices in a buffer from a specific user or with regex otherwise you can /filter based on tags found with /debug tags
2015-03-09 20:18:59	gb	filter will only rm the notices from the buffer display though, you can still grep for them or read them in logs

2015-03-09 21:50:18	thomas	so, irssi has a script (ho_reformat.pl) that'll grab those server notices and separate them based on specific regex patterns and dump them in separate buffers, mostly for readability purposes

2015-03-09 21:51:24	thomas	so we can't really create a buffer and set only a certain message level to go to that buffer in weechat?

2015-03-09 21:52:45	gb	nope the only way i managed to do it is via a very poor hack with a trigger to run a shell script to fifo it back into a seperate buffer but it was a very bad hack i'd not recommend
2015-03-09 21:53:07	thomas	hehe :)

2015-03-10 11:28:39	Mikaela	there is large port range specified, but WeeChat is unable to use those

2015-03-10 11:29:02	macker	impressive
2015-03-10 11:29:11	_dave2	Mikaela: Ok, so I am still getting the 0.0.0.0 in irssi as well as weechat. So I am quite sure it may have to do with Freenode's host masking.
2015-03-10 11:29:23	macker	you must not use flash and the plugin-container
2015-03-10 11:29:30	Lord	you are right

2015-03-10 11:29:35	Lord	i donc't use these shits
2015-03-10 11:29:41	wysiwtf	theres no irc server involved
2015-03-10 11:29:51	wysiwtf	okay, wrong
2015-03-10 11:29:57	wysiwtf	theres a ctcp message involved
2015-03-10 11:30:03	Lord	so you admit that your problem comes from flash and not firefox.

2015-03-10 11:41:21	polyzen	qutebrowser too
2015-03-10 11:41:23	demize	Depends on what your requirements are.
2015-03-10 11:41:29	polyzen	and that
2015-03-10 11:41:38	demize	If you want actual security than either Chromium or IE will be better than Fx.
2015-03-10 11:41:55	demize	But due to sandboxing Chromium will use more RAM than Fx.
2015-03-10 11:42:06	polyzen	but firejail ;p

2015-03-10 12:53:50	GermainZ	Those characters aren't available in many fonts

2015-03-10 12:54:15	Oddish	if he's using fixed width and he has any fixed width font that has those characters they should be pulled just fine though.
2015-03-10 12:54:19	Tsutsukakushi	it's just getty

2015-03-14 11:01:15	seanh	Hey, someone in this channel gave me a link a while ago to a page where you could paste in any website's URL and turn it into a Firefox App (for use with Glowing Bear for example). Can't seem to find it again for the life of me. Anyone know what it was?
2015-03-14 11:02:43	gb	maybe ask on #glowing-bear if it's glowing-bear related
2015-03-14 11:03:53	gb	do you have something i can grep for in my logs?

2015-03-14 12:47:05	gb	weechat.bar.status.color_bg is my guess at what you want
2015-03-14 12:47:15	MrElendig	donbruno: define "stop renaming"
2015-03-14 12:47:30	MrElendig	donbruno: you can't prevent a user from changing their nick
2015-03-14 12:47:44	MrElendig	(except by +q or +b them)
2015-03-14 12:47:49	gb	i found it with /iset status and there are heaps of coulour settings for all the items within status so check it out
2015-03-14 12:47:59	q_revert	gb: can you think of any reason why filters might work as expected on one irc server, but not on another?
2015-03-14 12:48:32	q_revert	i do /filter add filtername irc.freenode.#weechat nick_antuntun *
2015-03-14 12:48:35	q_revert	and it works perfectly
2015-03-14 12:48:36	gb	depends on how you defined the filter
2015-03-14 12:48:53	q_revert	and yet, identical syntax, where server != freenode, and it doesn't work
2015-03-14 12:49:30	gb	drop irc.freenode replace with * and it should work for both
2015-03-14 12:50:15	gb	to be sure of the correct buffer type /buffer for a list
2015-03-14 12:50:42	gb	only takes one mistype and the filter will break
2015-03-14 12:51:07	q_revert	i might make a gif, to at least assure myself that i'm not going insane
2015-03-14 12:51:09	gb	you can also toggle filtering on only one buffer with alt -
2015-03-14 12:51:17	donbruno	MrElendig: sorry, what I mean is, when a nick rename himself, irc give a short text... also by joining the channel
2015-03-14 12:51:36	MrElendig	donbruno: enable the smartfilter if you want to hide it
2015-03-14 12:51:46	gb	so if you did this by mistake on a buffer it will stop filtering and * will be missing from status
2015-03-14 12:52:01	MrElendig	donbruno: /help filter has it as an example

2015-03-14 15:11:23	gb	first step re colors is to configure your TERM variable correctly
2015-03-14 15:11:46	gb	if it is xterm or screen you will be limited to 16colours
2015-03-14 15:13:06	gb	also highly dependant on your window manager terminal software
2015-03-14 15:14:17	gb	yellow on one machine may be brown for instance on certain proprietry software that is user friendly suppossedly
2015-03-14 15:16:07	gb	so if your colours look bleargh in your present term software try a different piece of software before changing too many weechat settings

2015-03-14 21:47:30	tekkbuzz	I thought you were gonna write him a syntax colorizing script.
2015-03-14 21:47:51	gb	ie a highlight everything in a buffer trigger
2015-03-14 21:48:32	gb	and my own tts trigger with bash helper script which sorta fails if the text wraps
2015-03-14 21:49:47	tekkbuzz	I suppose just custom setting up irc.look.nick_color_force might work.
2015-03-14 21:49:55	gb	but yeah it'd help to know how fancy they'd want to go if i could be bothered to take a crack at it
2015-03-14 21:50:42	tekkbuzz	if you put all the syntax words in:   irc.look.nick_color_force

2015-03-14 22:14:35	gb	my hope re the tts was to do something similar to colorize_nick but in speach instead with a voice for each nick but it never worked well enough for just one voice

2015-03-18 22:45:02	gb	for example my irc.server.fn.command = "/eval /msg nickserv regain ${sec.fn.nick};/mode $nick -i"
2015-03-18 22:45:37	gb	i login with sasl but sometimes my ghost remains
2015-03-18 22:46:14	gb	so i let nickserv regain it for me
2015-03-18 22:48:00	gb	you can also use /wait between commands if it's imperative one command completes before another
2015-03-18 22:48:40	gb	please check /help for each of those components for proper usage though

2015-03-20 18:05:58	mozzarella	I just want to move the symlink to the parent folder, basically
2015-03-20 18:06:15	mozzarella	I thought that's what /script noautoload did
2015-03-20 18:07:37	gb	how did you install seen.rb?
2015-03-20 18:07:49	gb	it is not in /script for me
2015-03-20 18:09:21	gb	script can pretty much only remove scripts it knows about not do anything to those you installed manually

2015-03-21 00:07:45	@FlashCode	not highlight on lines themselves
2015-03-21 00:08:14	@FlashCode	if you use beep.pl, consider using the trigger (which is default in version >= 1.0)
2015-03-21 00:08:19	@FlashCode	and you can customize the trigger
2015-03-21 00:08:30	appledash	:(
2015-03-21 00:08:56	@FlashCode	so you want no beep or no highlight?
2015-03-21 00:08:58	@FlashCode	this is different
2015-03-21 00:09:06	appledash	I want both
2015-03-21 00:09:22	@FlashCode	or nothing in hotlist, which is different too?
2015-03-21 00:09:27	appledash	all 3!
2015-03-21 00:09:40	@FlashCode	you can keep highlights, but without beep or hotlist, not enough?
2015-03-21 00:09:43	appledash	I'm on a network that is terrible and I ping out every 10 minutes or so, and the server buffer highlights me on every connect for some reason, I don't want that
2015-03-21 00:09:51	appledash	It is very annoying
2015-03-21 00:10:18	@FlashCode	what about filtering such messages then?
2015-03-21 00:10:27	appledash	That could work
2015-03-21 00:10:32	@FlashCode	removing completely highlights just because of some annoying messages is maybe not the best solution
2015-03-21 00:10:44	@FlashCode	you can try with /filter
2015-03-21 00:10:51	appledash	I'll look into it
2015-03-21 00:10:51	@FlashCode	and a regex or tags (/debug tags to see tags)
2015-03-21 00:10:55	@FlashCode	see /help filter

2015-03-21 06:14:47	Junka	but it's not working obviously

2015-03-21 06:15:03	grawity	that's why it's called Symbola

2015-03-21 11:24:02	DavidFromBelgium	I first installed Weechat using an rpm from epel but it was version 0.4.3 so I ended up compiling from source to get a more recent one
2015-03-21 11:24:12	gb	if you do not have python/perl dev lib/headers installed then cmake will build without the missing headers
2015-03-21 11:24:22	DavidFromBelgium	ok let me check...
2015-03-21 11:25:18	DavidFromBelgium	python-devel not installed. I'll install it and recompile Weechat
2015-03-21 11:25:23	gb	if you installed prebuilt then you need to have the binaries of python, perl, etc at the very least but both headers/binaries if building from source

2015-03-21 14:57:12	DavidFromBelgium	so when a window becomes active, the status bar appears and all the lines scroll one line up to let that status bar display
2015-03-21 14:57:19	DavidFromBelgium	if that makes sense

2015-03-23 03:29:53	stfn	mbeasley: it's a POSIX extended regular expression
2015-03-23 03:30:06	@FlashCode	you can use ^ or $, no problem, but no / / around
2015-03-23 03:30:41	@FlashCode	I'll add a better example, you're right, there's no good example for that
2015-03-23 03:32:02	mbeasley	stfn & FlashCode: that's informative. i appreciate the help
2015-03-23 03:32:44	mbeasley	any idea why this wouldn't work then?:  /filter add bots perl.chanmon * ^<SLACK>((?!fail).)*$
2015-03-23 03:33:24	mbeasley	(not the regex itself, but it errors when adding the filter)
2015-03-23 03:36:12	@FlashCode	I'm not sure (?! is valid, is it?
2015-03-23 03:36:26	@FlashCode	(? has special meaning

2015-03-23 03:36:43	stfn	?! is a negative look ahead
2015-03-23 03:36:45	mbeasley	right. should be a negative lookahead.
2015-03-23 03:36:47	stfn	but posix doesn't support that
2015-03-23 03:36:57	@FlashCode	yes, not supported
2015-03-23 03:37:17	mbeasley	ah. that makes sense
2015-03-23 03:38:30	mbeasley	i'll need to get my head out of perl-regex-land.
2015-03-23 03:39:16	stfn	sometimes I also think it would be cool if weechat supported PCRE :D
2015-03-23 03:41:11	mbeasley	agreed. i'm struggling to figure out how to translate something like that into posix regex.
2015-03-23 03:42:23	mbeasley	oh wait - maybe not so hard. thanks guys!

2015-03-26 12:38:18	macker	does the weechat config file have all options already in place but set to default, or do you actually have to add them through shell?
2015-03-26 12:38:43	macker	so used to just hacking up configs using vim
2015-03-26 12:38:50	FBI	macker: you really should use /set instead of editing the config by hand
2015-03-26 12:39:08	macker	 ive used /save
2015-03-26 12:39:18	macker	difference?
2015-03-26 12:39:21	FBI	macker: and some config options are actually only created dynamicly
2015-03-26 12:39:28	macker	thought so
2015-03-26 12:39:29	FBI	eg when you set it
2015-03-26 12:39:36	gb	no idea what you mean by shell typically you change most via iset.pl script or add them with set for things like target_buffer
2015-03-26 12:39:52	macker	gb: via terminal and server
2015-03-26 12:40:11	macker	rather than just using VI etc
2015-03-26 12:40:25	gb	no never edit configs directly as weechat overwrites the config on quit/upgrade
2015-03-26 12:40:28	macker	whatever your flavor, NANO

2015-03-26 12:41:54	gb	you can also badly corrupt the config if you make a typo editing it outside weechat with wee throwing away the bad bits and stuff that follows
2015-03-26 12:42:26	gb	just dont do it, it's not bitchx :)
2015-03-26 12:42:27	macker	small learning curve, still like it though
2015-03-26 12:42:41	macker	lol yeah well used to bc so

2015-03-26 12:43:07	gb	yes i saw :P
2015-03-26 12:43:35	strayPuppy	I found that editing the config, was the only way to delete a broken key that I had made once. But did it while weechat wasn't loaded. Worked for me.
2015-03-26 12:43:58	macker	yeah you can tweak some settings
2015-03-26 12:44:13	macker	just dont export support or something
2015-03-26 12:44:13	gb	strayPuppy: sure but it is still risky
2015-03-26 12:44:33	macker	like color values and shit
2015-03-26 12:44:38	gb	if you have to ask then you definitely shouldn't play with the configs :)

We now have nearly april and the script is still on the site for pending scripts. Is there anything i can do to speed the process up?

2015-03-29 02:24:31	@FlashCode	shaardie: I should look at pending scripts soon (I added scripts that were waiting for more than one year recently..)
2015-03-29 02:24:59	@FlashCode	to speed up the process people can try scripts and report me problems, or just tell me if scripts are working fine
2015-03-29 02:26:30	shaardie	FlashCode: Okay. I will do that. Thanks for the answer.
2015-03-29 02:27:22	@FlashCode	I prefer having strict rules for scripts, so it takes lot of time to test them, and examine source code
2015-03-29 02:27:56	@FlashCode	but be sure your script will be accepted soon if everything is ok (if not you'll receive an email with the problems)
2015-03-29 02:30:03	egrep	weechat blindly assumes that the server I'm connecting to has the same rdns as what I put under addresses... so connecting to irc.* with SSL fails when the certificate is for a servername.irc.* or servername.* or something like that... which... yeah.
2015-03-29 02:30:05	shaardie	Okay. I was only a little bit concerned that the process do not go on at all, but if it is only a matter of time, i can wait.
2015-03-29 02:30:38	egrep	Or gnutls.

2015-03-29 03:10:32	Grey_Loki	Hi. I'm having some weirdness with weechat, but I'm not totally sure if it's weechat, or PuTTY/Byobu. In short, the blue bar at the bottom of the default layout (which shows server, channel, and activity notifications) isn't one continuous horizontal line - it has a black section in it.
2015-03-29 03:10:52	Grey_Loki	The functionality is still there, but aesthetically the black bit bugs me - is it some strange option in weechat?

2015-03-29 07:47:09	@FlashCode	sjk: the problem is that weechat relay protocol is only designed for remote display, so you don't have the same features as in weechat: no completion or such things

2015-03-29 16:46:18	haavard	Does anyone have an idea on integrating weechat with the pass password manager? That is, getting nickserv/server passwords from a shell command like "pass show irc/freenode"
2015-03-29 16:47:28	gb	haavard: i use /secure in weechat and /eval ${sec.conf.variable} in aliases, etc

2015-03-29 16:47:53	gb	but a /secure buffer will show passwords, etc with alt v
2015-03-29 16:49:10	gb	you could use fifo to action an alias i suppose externally if that is what you mean
2015-03-29 16:49:12	haavard	I mean like, what if I stored the passwords in pass. Could weechat then extract those, somehow?

2015-03-31 21:10:01	Nicd-	and umm, are you connecting TO bitblee with ssl or are you trying to get bitlbee to connect with ssl?
2015-03-31 21:12:38	voidead	Nicd-, it says connection refused.. I'm using bitlbee on my VPS locally and when I change all the settings it says connection refused addresses is "localhost/6697"

2015-03-31 21:14:11	Nicd-	if bitlbee is running locally, why are you using ssl?
2015-03-31 21:14:24	Nicd-	and ipv6 is also useless as it is on localhost

2015-03-31 21:16:38	Nicd-	ssl makes no sense as no one can intercept the traffic *inside* your VPS anyway
2015-03-31 21:16:44	Nicd-	and if they can, you have bigger problems
2015-03-31 21:17:11	voidead	lol yeah
2015-03-31 21:17:22	voidead	if I were using port 22 for instance
2015-03-31 21:18:40	Nicd-	the port doesn't matter if it's localhost
2015-03-31 21:19:00	Nicd-	localhost traffic does not go outside the system
2015-03-31 21:22:02	Nicd-	so remove your ssl setup and ipv6 and it should work

2015-06-17 11:04:55	@nils_2	you can force to open a new buffer to "near_server" instead of the end of the list of buffers
2015-06-17 11:05:38	hat|	ok, working, perfect
2015-06-17 11:06:01	@nils_2	after you moved the buffers to there final destination, use "/layout store" and then "/save"
2015-06-17 11:06:48	@nils_2	with "/layout apply" you can rebuild the list of buffers
2015-06-17 11:07:41	@nils_2	but, /layout is not to autojoin channels. some people misunderstand the function of /layout, thats why i mentioned it

2015-06-17 15:43:42	mythmon	Can someone help me figure out how to make a trigger that marks all messages from a particular server with the tag 'notify_private'?
2015-06-17 15:44:59	gb	no anyone is not online at the moment
2015-06-17 15:45:12	gb	oops sumone either

2015-06-17 15:46:05	mythmon	it isn't bitlbee, but that is something like that, yes.
2015-06-17 15:46:47	gb	i know nothing about adding tags but detecting a server is easy enough
2015-06-17 15:46:57	mythmon	that would be more than i have so far
2015-06-17 15:47:27	gb	did you look at /help trigger
2015-06-17 15:47:43	mythmon	i have looked at it, but i can't really understand what to do with it.
2015-06-17 15:47:45	gb	!trigger also has many examples of server matching
2015-06-17 15:47:45	+weebot	Triggers examples: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/wiki/Triggers
2015-06-17 15:48:46	gb	i'd need to know lots more info before i could write the trigger myself though
2015-06-17 15:49:23	gb	why do you want another tag added?
2015-06-17 15:50:27	mythmon	the server, pickups, presents all messages as channels, not pms.
2015-06-17 15:50:51	mythmon	i need it to have the priority and highlighting of private messages. additionally i have a notifier that reads the tags to decide to notify me.
2015-06-17 15:51:32	gb	can you call the notifier manually?
2015-06-17 15:51:47	mythmon	not really.
2015-06-17 15:51:54	gb	it might be simpler to just have the trigger do whatever is needed to notify you

2015-06-17 15:52:14	mythmon	the notifier is a weechat relay client.
2015-06-17 15:52:47	mythmon	i want to get highlights for all messages on this server like i would for highlights or pms.
2015-06-17 15:52:48	gb	ahh ok
2015-06-17 15:55:01	gb	i've not done modifier triggers before but signal/print triggers are simple

2015-06-17 18:47:56	Raku_	I guess i could just have it as "!= \x01VERSION Weechat 1.2\x01" or whatever
2015-06-17 18:48:08	Raku_	But then anything like hexchat or something would alert me
2015-06-17 18:48:21	singalaut	Atually… I just remember that it’s easier to use print trigger for checking the reply. Just check if the tags contain “irc_notice,irc_ctcp”
2015-06-17 18:49:03	Raku_	Well i more need to check the content of the ctcp
2015-06-17 18:49:46	 *	Raku_ reads on print triggers though

2015-06-17 18:55:58	Raku_	Ack, i tried setting it to "${server}.${channel} = Freenode.#weechat" and now it's querying everyone
2015-06-17 18:56:18	Raku_	Or everyone on every server, rather
2015-06-17 18:57:11	singalaut	Print trigger already has its own tag check, eg: `/trigger add ctcp_reply print irc.freenode.#weechat;irc_ctcp` but it has no ${nick} variable. You’ll have to do some manual regex replacement to get the nick. Now I’m not sure which one is easier

2015-06-17 18:58:19	Raku_	I thought that it would get ${nick} from who sent the ctcp
2015-06-17 18:58:24	Raku_	It was doing it earlier
2015-06-17 18:58:35	Raku_	When i had it print ${nick} has an old version
2015-06-17 18:58:39	Raku_	It'd do it
2015-06-17 18:58:46	Raku_	Ohhh
2015-06-17 18:58:56	Raku_	Sorry i read wrong, you meant with the print trigger
2015-06-17 18:59:29	Raku_	I feel like this one would be easier, i'd rather do some fancy regex on the versin reple to find the weechat version than to find the nick

2015-06-23 21:51:09	gb	i've never used it so no clue if it adds a bar or just gives you an item
2015-06-23 21:51:51	ReqGame	i think it just gives me items
2015-06-23 21:52:07	gb	may tell you in the script the name of the item you need to add too any bar
2015-06-23 21:53:13	gb	you can actually move things like the time to your nicklist for example or title bar
2015-06-23 21:54:11	ReqGame	yea im still fairly new to all this. been using linux for about 4 months :P. I have no idea how i got arch installed

2015-06-23 21:54:24	ReqGame	:)
2015-06-23 21:54:26	gb	but most likely it never removed buffers you just hid it yourself by mistake on the reload :)
2015-06-23 21:54:53	ReqGame	i see i see.

2015-06-23 22:01:07	gb	then if needbe you can rollback to a .weechat before you installed/removed a script and reload will work sanely
2015-06-23 22:01:44	gb	mostly just use iset to do/undo things though
2015-06-23 22:01:51	ReqGame	yea i made a backup :)

2015-06-28 20:04:23	gb	hit it often and hard enough and you can go get a real device :)
2015-06-28 20:04:32	talisein	ah, highlight_tags_count is NOTwhat you want
2015-06-28 20:05:15	TheMoonMaster	gb: I would, but it seems Apple took all the quality hardware. ;)

2015-06-28 20:08:45	zutto	less things to port
2015-06-28 20:08:45	TheMoonMaster	I plan on it eventually
2015-06-28 20:08:50	TheMoonMaster	But I'm picky on hardware
2015-06-28 20:09:08	TheMoonMaster	The closest thing to decent is an X1C, which I owned at one point but didn't realize the fhd screen was a tn pane, and awful.
2015-06-28 20:09:30	TheMoonMaster	So I returned it since I don't really feel like dealing with QHD screens + linux.
2015-06-28 20:09:32	zutto	x1c was a bad generation of thinkpads
2015-06-28 20:09:45	zutto	you should seek for the ones they're releasing late this year/early next year
2015-06-28 20:09:55	TheMoonMaster	The "retro" ones?
2015-06-28 20:10:00	gb	TheMoonMaster: i use imap_status presently and have been told to write a script to handle the mail messages coming in which will never happen but arza also write checkmail if you want to check it out but it'snot in the repo yet
2015-06-28 20:10:12	zutto	rather than calling them retro, i'd call them "unraped"
2015-06-28 20:10:13	gb	wrote sorry
2015-06-28 20:10:42	TheMoonMaster	gb: Oh, I don't mean mutt in weechat, I mean weechat and mutt in tmux.
2015-06-28 20:10:54	zutto	the generations they released this year/late last year were raped with few annoyances that were not acceptable in the thinkpad religion
2015-06-28 20:10:59	TheMoonMaster	zutto: Haha, fair enough. The hardware looked great, I just hope the keyboard isn't that insane.
2015-06-28 20:11:23	TheMoonMaster	I don't mind chiclet keys, but I also don't want the crazy layout that they showed off.
2015-06-28 20:11:34	gb	yeah i do similar with screen but imap_status lets me know there is mail waiting
2015-06-28 20:11:46	zutto	the layout they showed was your typical thinkpad keyboard.. with one mistake being the end/insert key mixup
2015-06-28 20:12:02	gb	plus it supports using /secure now for the password
2015-06-28 20:12:18	TheMoonMaster	Yeah, I guess I'm not a fan of the typical thinkpad keyboard then. :/

2015-06-28 22:17:37	Nicd-	but it's no different than just installing linux on a laptop
2015-06-28 22:18:15	Nicd-	aside from the two kill switches, one of which (wifi) is in many laptops already (and the camera usually has a led)
2015-06-28 22:18:42	zutto	the killswitches are real killswitches, unlike the normal software-ping switches
2015-06-28 22:18:49	zutto	and the led on the camera can be disabled with s/w
2015-06-28 22:19:06	zutto	actually you need to manually turn the led on if you poke the camera api
2015-06-28 22:19:42	zutto	the selling point is that the hardware is carefully picked to be very compatible with lunix
2015-06-28 22:20:09	zutto	things that wont be "oh i wish i could turn this on but my hw doesnt have proper support yet"
2015-06-28 22:21:40	zutto	but yeah, i dont think the camera/micrphone/wifi is the issue
2015-06-28 22:21:54	zutto	mostly the hardware that has so many propietary things that you cant do anything about
2015-06-28 22:22:35	Nicd-	which is not any different on that laptop
2015-06-28 22:23:31	zutto	sure it is
2015-06-28 22:24:15	zutto	actually just noticed
2015-06-28 22:24:29	zutto	that librem has the same casing as the kingdel base design
2015-06-28 22:24:41	zutto	just black instead

2015-06-28 22:48:20	gb	highmon works with all versions from .3 on i think if you read the souyrce comments

2015-06-28 22:50:00	guyh	t3chguy: thanks... must just be me.
2015-06-28 22:50:10	t3chguy	you need to remember that the Perl plugin acts as an abstraction, so that things can be supported even if weechat core has large changes
2015-06-28 22:50:44	guyh	t3chguy: Sindre Sorhus' osx notification script is broken, though, for example.
2015-06-28 22:53:31	t3chguy	thats probably due to changes on the OSX side of things to be fair
2015-06-28 22:54:05	guyh	t3chguy: don't doubt it. i was just feeling paranoid.

2015-07-02 15:49:28	Paris_	After an update none of my shortcuts using alt are working.  I can't switch between buffers using <alt> and <num>.
2015-07-02 15:49:43	Paris_	Instead I just get text in superscript.
2015-07-02 15:50:44	MrElendig	sounds like a TE issue
2015-07-02 15:50:53	MrElendig	which TE are you using?
2015-07-02 15:51:25	Paris_	TE?
2015-07-02 15:52:14	Paris_	Text Editor?

2015-07-02 23:32:47	les	I'm trying out weechat after years with irssi.  Is there a way to use letters for buffer numbers greater than 9? Looking for a way Alt-a would go to buffer 10, b to 11, etc

2015-07-02 23:33:30	Yaniel	but meta-j NN is better imo

2015-07-03 00:24:00	Raku_	It only happens in the control channel you specify in the script's settings, so i'm guessing it's caused by the script. I wouldn't doubt  it's another script though, obviously script author used it, so they would have noticed such an error

2015-07-03 09:38:59	sillysausage	but sometimes when i connect directly through weechat i want the same
2015-07-03 09:39:22	sillysausage	http://wiki.znc.in/Noctcp
2015-07-03 09:40:14	sillysausage	i thought maybe ctcp is a plugin that can simply not be loaded
2015-07-03 09:40:48	sillysausage	i know i can set specific ones like VERSION
2015-07-03 09:40:50	sillysausage	but there's others
2015-07-03 09:41:05	sillysausage	like FINGER and TIME
2015-07-03 09:41:15	@FlashCode	you can disable the replies
2015-07-03 09:41:19	@FlashCode	see user's guide
2015-07-03 09:41:26	@FlashCode	but not globally, one by one
2015-07-03 09:41:41	@FlashCode	to disable them all, you could write a trigger
2015-07-03 09:42:12	sillysausage	can i find a list of them all then?
2015-07-03 09:42:21	sillysausage	http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html
2015-07-03 09:42:24	sillysausage	is the list there
2015-07-03 09:42:29	sillysausage	under KNOWN REQUEST/REPLY PAIRS
2015-07-03 09:42:36	sillysausage	the ones that weechat implements, or could there be others?
2015-07-03 09:42:41	@FlashCode	in user's guide you have the most commons
2015-07-03 09:42:49	@FlashCode	there could be others
2015-07-03 09:43:16	@FlashCode	there's no limit in ctcp names
2015-07-03 09:43:24	sillysausage	https://www.weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#irc_ctcp_replies
2015-07-03 09:43:27	sillysausage	i guess is all of them?
2015-07-03 09:43:37	ser_berry	you can CTCP anything though
2015-07-03 09:43:51	sillysausage	so there's no actual way to just disable ctcp alltogether
2015-07-03 09:43:52	@FlashCode	the most commons, as ai said
2015-07-03 09:44:00	ser_berry	no, FlashCode just said you could use a trigger
2015-07-03 09:44:03	@FlashCode	you could with a trigger
2015-07-03 09:44:05	ser_berry	to disable all of them
2015-07-03 09:44:09	sillysausage	oh, how would i do that?
2015-07-03 09:44:19	@FlashCode	I don't have the syntax right now
2015-07-03 09:44:35	ser_berry	I'd be interested in how that would work as well
2015-07-03 09:44:37	sillysausage	okay ill try googling about for that
2015-07-03 09:44:48	@FlashCode	I'm not at home, I can give you the syntax in some hours
2015-07-03 09:44:57	sillysausage	okay then
2015-07-03 09:45:01	ser_berry	thanks FlashCode, I'd appreciate that
2015-07-03 09:45:05	@FlashCode	check existing triggers in github wiki
2015-07-03 09:45:11	@FlashCode	but not sure there's one
2015-07-03 09:45:35	@FlashCode	I'll add one there
2015-07-03 09:45:43	aji	did that script memory use bug get fixed?
2015-07-03 09:47:52	t3chguy	FlashCode: is it relatively safe to move a .weechat dir with dumped state data between two physically identical systems?
2015-07-03 09:47:55	@FlashCode	aji: which script and bug?

2015-07-03 12:29:34	t3chguy	and it has no space

2015-07-06 15:18:57	Raku_	You need to have your time format set to a specific way though
2015-07-06 15:18:59	sparr	I am using weechat via ssh and screen. Occasionally something happens in a channel where viewing certain lines of text corrupts my display, allowing lines to overflow in my console, new lines starting on a column other than the leftmost, etc. Parts of the display stay corrupted when I change buffers, and it all re-corrupts when I go back to the buffer/line in question. Help?
2015-07-06 15:19:04	Raku_	Maybe i could just modif that

2015-07-06 15:19:41	Raku_	Does /window refresh help?

2015-07-06 15:21:12	sparr	Raku_: yes, /window refresh helps some. doing that removes all of the corruption and leaves just the offending lines running wider than they should. if I then scroll the buffer in question, the whole buffer corrupts again. screenshot after /window refresh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l5wwzefrhpu6h3u/Screenshot%202015-07-06%2017.20.11.png?dl=0
2015-07-06 15:22:01	sparr	the amount of line length overflow seems to correspond to those blank spaces after the start of each person's name in those lines. perhaps there is a control character there being misrepresented/handled?

2015-07-22 18:36:46	gb	perhaps that's more what you want

2015-07-28 19:38:35	gb	i have no clue what pushover does but it should also contain author contact so you can hassle them even to get it working/fix a bug you might have stumbled across

2015-07-30 16:50:10	Phil21	hmm, is there a way to get weechat to re-use the nickname colors per channel?
2015-07-30 16:54:01	farn	Phil21: what do you mean by re-use per channel?
2015-07-30 16:54:13	Phil21	right now color assignments seem global
2015-07-30 16:54:27	Phil21	if someone talking in #channel1 gets assigned a color, then it's never reused in other channels
2015-07-30 16:54:54	Phil21	wanted to pare down my color list some, but have it just be unique per channel (never that many talkers, but over lots of channels it adds up)
2015-07-30 16:56:23	farn	weechat simply computes a hash of the nick and selects the color based on that
2015-07-30 16:57:02	farn	so the same nick will always have the same color and it doesn't matter who else is in the channel
2015-07-30 16:57:29	farn	that can't be changed
2015-07-30 16:58:42	farn	well, you can choose between two hash functions with irc.look.nick_color_hash, but that doesn't change much
2015-07-30 16:59:13	farn	if there are specific conflicts that annoy you, there is irc.look.nick_color_force
2015-07-30 17:02:30	Phil21	how does it handle running out of colors?
2015-07-30 17:02:34	Phil21	recycles oldest?
2015-07-30 17:02:59	Phil21	it's not the end of the world, just would like a bit finer control over color pallet per-channel
2015-07-30 17:03:01	Phil21	I can deal :)
2015-07-30 17:03:34	farn	it's just (hash of nick) mod (number of colors)
2015-07-30 17:03:35	Max^	hmm.. so there is a way to stop the nick showing in dark blue?
2015-07-30 17:03:45	farn	so if you're really unlucky, everyone in a channel could get the same color
2015-07-30 17:04:20	Max^	is it possible to just disable nick colors
2015-07-30 17:04:20	farn	Max^: sounds like you want to remove that color from weechat.color.chat_nick_colors
2015-07-30 17:04:26	Max^	ok
2015-07-30 17:04:30	farn	/set weechat.color.chat_nick_colors default
2015-07-30 17:04:58	Max^	is that for the nick near the timestamp
2015-07-30 17:05:07	farn	yes
2015-07-30 17:05:14	Max^	ok.. good
2015-07-30 17:06:48	Phil21	farn: ah, duh I see thanks
2015-07-30 17:06:53	Phil21	ok, that's actually fine for my use

2015-07-31 10:02:37	farn	no, apparently just /wait 30 <stuff>

2015-07-31 10:03:39	DopplerDeflect	I do not wish to ignore them, just move them.

2015-07-31 10:07:37	farn	you can filter them, which doesn't show them in another buffer, but it allows you to hide and show them in the original buffer whenever you want. have a look at https://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat_faq.en.html#filter_irc_join_part_quit

2015-08-01 01:19:43	Benguin	no error output, either
2015-08-01 01:20:17	Benguin	but it /does/ have a command to open the most recent link. It just doesn't seem to work right now.
2015-08-01 01:21:51	heoyea	cant u just click on the URL to open?
2015-08-01 01:22:34	Benguin	the whole point is that I'd rather not. It's pretty inconvenient in weechat, as if an url is too long, you have to either adjust buffer width to accommodate or use alt-L to switch to link mode
2015-08-01 01:22:46	Benguin	which, while not /that/ hard is still pretty annoying and this would have been an ideal solution.
2015-08-01 01:24:09	 *	singalaut uses urlselect.lua
2015-08-01 01:24:49	Benguin	I'm lookin' at that now
2015-08-01 01:25:06	Benguin	doesn't seem to have an "open first url in 1 button combo" feature though
2015-08-01 01:25:11	Benguin	unless I'm overlookink it?
2015-08-01 01:25:14	Benguin	-k
2015-08-01 01:25:38	singalaut	Yeah, you have to activate it first and then press alt-o ​​​​​​​​
2015-08-01 01:25:57	Benguin	hmm I could probably just alias both commands to one key, right?
2015-08-01 01:27:50	Benguin	Actually I can't get that to work either
2015-08-01 01:27:50	singalaut	Try (for alt-enter): /key bind meta-ctrl-M /urlselect;/urlselect run o;/urlselect deactivate ​​​​​​​​
2015-08-01 01:28:17	singalaut	Works fine here. What error did you get? ​​​​​​​​
2015-08-01 01:28:33	Benguin	well I tried /urlselect activate and it didn't do anything. didn't error
2015-08-01 01:28:37	heoyea	clicking url seems quickest
2015-08-01 01:28:56	Benguin	heoyea: if the url fits on screen, yes. But much of the time, it won't fit on screen.
2015-08-01 01:28:59	@FlashCode	and there's "bare display" to click easily on URLs (alt-L)
2015-08-01 01:29:06	@FlashCode	Benguin: ^^
2015-08-01 01:29:15	Benguin	I know, I just want an alternative that doesn't take as much work
2015-08-01 01:29:16	heoyea	Benguin: i use url shorter
2015-08-01 01:29:20	heoyea	so it always fits

2015-08-01 01:32:45	Benguin	I bound that to alt-u, singalaut; doesn't work for me. (can't use control-enter because that's my close buffer key)
2015-08-01 01:35:59	singalaut	Is your weechat not running locally? All it does is just run /exec xdg-open <url> (or /exec open <url> in mac) ​​​​​​​​
2015-08-01 01:36:26	Benguin	It's running locally.

2015-08-01 03:03:33	@FlashCode	it should reconnect, there are 2 cases:
2015-08-01 03:03:44	@FlashCode	1. the server sends a ping and your weechat does not answer: you can be disconnected after some minutes
2015-08-01 03:03:58	@FlashCode	2. you send a message, and weechat detects the socket is done, you'll be immediately disconnected
2015-08-01 03:04:16	@FlashCode	and even 3. weechat sends a ping, server does not answer, you'll be disconnected in case of high lag
2015-08-01 03:04:22	@FlashCode	(depending on your options)
2015-08-01 03:04:33	@FlashCode	see /set *lag* for lag options
2015-08-01 03:05:00	geosmin	so if i enable my vpn weechat should stay connected to this channel?
2015-08-01 03:05:03	arahael	\0t
2015-08-01 03:05:05	@FlashCode	you can force reconnection on smaller lag than default (you'll be reconnected more often then)
2015-08-01 03:07:09	geosmin	FlashCode: ^

2015-08-01 03:22:51	noctux	FlashCode: ok: The issue, or more precisely its manifestation is the backlog that is sent
2015-08-01 03:23:14	noctux	FlashCode: which is sometimes duplicated, too much, ...
2015-08-01 03:23:38	noctux	so imho there is only one party in the game that knows how many backlog it needs: the client that connects
2015-08-01 03:24:40	noctux	so in a fashion similar to the znc-playback plugin (http://wiki.znc.in/Playback), the client should request the backlog since the last message he has received for a specified channel
2015-08-01 03:25:12	noctux	but here is where the problem starts :D
2015-08-01 03:25:47	noctux	for what I've seen the irc protocol has no way to pass such information during connection

2015-08-01 03:28:28	noctux	the only thing I could think of would be to have a custom capability (weechat.org/replay) or such
2015-08-01 03:29:49	noctux	if client and server negotiate on that capability, the server blocks all outgoing messages (queueing them as they arrive) until the replay request arrived and was finished
2015-08-01 03:31:11	noctux	that would be the basic idea. Downside is that this would embed a custom, badly designed protocol extension in the core implementation of plugins/relay/relay-irc...
2015-08-01 03:31:25	noctux	so I wondered if you've got a better idea?

2015-08-01 15:36:27	Boobuigi	Hell no.
2015-08-01 15:36:58	grawity	I'm sure the issue isn't that IRC != HTTP, but that your DNS server died sometime after you connected to IRC
2015-08-01 15:37:33	Boobuigi	Ahh... so connecting to any new IRC server should fail also.
2015-08-01 15:38:16	Boobuigi	Indeed.
2015-08-01 15:38:47	Boobuigi	And I'm probably screwed should a netsplit occur.
2015-08-01 15:39:38	Boobuigi	... I just wanted to believe there was something magical about IRC, like how phone lines work during power outages.  Guess not.

2015-08-01 16:59:43	Linlz	Could you write back next time your at your dev machine?
2015-08-01 17:03:46	gb	unlikely  but something vey wrong with your build environment i see no perl, python and a lot of other stuff missing
2015-08-01 17:04:10	gb	what dist?
2015-08-01 17:04:11	Linlz	im building it on centos
2015-08-01 17:04:48	gb	ahh yes i do recall others having trouble on that but noone has written a guide for building on it yet
2015-08-01 17:05:33	gb	but most do manage to sort it i just have no clue how they did sorry
2015-08-01 17:06:09	Linlz	Guess I have to stick with version 0.4.3 until someone can help me :(
2015-08-01 17:07:13	gb	some archaic dists are difficult to build on
2015-08-01 17:07:35	gb	even debian is quite a hassle at times
2015-08-01 17:08:45	gb	you could try fudg installing a deb but without the running libs it'd most likely crash out

2015-08-02 09:52:20	t3chguy	there's a trigger in the wiki to apply a colour to a specific nick, just adapt that to your own nick and to add underline instead

2015-08-02 10:04:15	lol768	you can also pin the fingerprint though

2015-08-02 10:05:05	reza	how?

2015-08-02 10:09:59	_`_	Nicd-: most smaller irc networks are using self signed certificates making it nearly impossible for a user to get the fingerprint in a trustworthy manner.

2015-08-02 10:10:12	zamabe	Nicd-: besides, pinning is only useful if the self-signed certs are kept updated, which as I've seen, is definitely not the case.

2015-08-02 20:48:23	JungleBoogie	thank you
2015-08-02 20:48:53	gb	no buffer does not create new buffers
2015-08-02 20:49:07	gb	might be nice if it could i think :)
2015-08-02 20:49:47	gb	sorta like /exec -n creates a new buffer would be pretty cool
2015-08-02 20:51:34	gb	if you want to move buffers round willy nilly you can also install buffers.pl and use the mouse dragging up/down or left/right to move buffers
2015-08-02 20:52:07	gb	the buffers bar gives you immediate feedback on positioning
2015-08-02 20:52:37	gb	once done you can disable mouse moving buffers easilly
2015-08-02 20:53:03	gb	depends how lazy you are :)
2015-08-02 20:54:25	JungleBoogie	well i just need the irc server to be on its own so I can get to it and join channels. right now its shared with freenode
2015-08-02 20:55:12	gb	you can unmerge any buffer you want or even run in independant mode which unmerges everything
2015-08-02 20:55:48	JungleBoogie	i did /buffer unmerge but it won't separate out freenode and geekshed
2015-08-02 20:57:19	gb	ok check /help irc.look.server_buffer
2015-08-02 20:57:49	gb	you can also /set and tab complete through the numerous available options one might take your fancy

2015-08-02 20:59:40	JungleBoogie	i'm sure
2015-08-02 20:59:46	gb	if you run in independant you can still /buffer merge buffers together

2015-08-02 22:54:00	@FlashCode	then fix the way to copy the file to another computer, by changing the uid
2015-08-02 22:54:08	grawity	though tbh forcing the mode to 0664 is basically at the *bottom* of the list

2015-08-02 22:54:31	grawity	regardless of security, what does ftp have to do with uids?
2015-08-02 22:54:37	grawity	ftp doesn't force files to be world-readable
2015-08-02 22:54:39	JungleBoogie	that's great, gb
2015-08-02 22:54:46	grawity	it's not different from sftp or rsync in that regard
2015-08-02 22:54:54	JungleBoogie	thank you for creating weechat, FlashCode
2015-08-02 22:55:05	grawity	if you log in as "drbean", you can read all files owned by "drbean", even if they're 0600

2015-08-02 22:55:55	drbean	I will investigate rsync.

2015-08-02 23:57:51	t3chguy	WeeChat supports anything that supports the IRCd Spec
2015-08-02 23:58:05	t3chguy	erm, why would you need a Slack related script?
2015-08-02 23:58:26	sjoshi	t3chguy: assuming it has something more to offer :p
2015-08-02 23:58:55	gb	maybe slack is an ircd wannabe that does wierder things
2015-08-02 23:58:56	t3chguy	I doubt that Slack's IRC Gateway offers more, since it'll be being limited by the IRC Spec

2015-08-20 22:30:02	gb	thanks flash for fixing it

2015-08-20 22:31:13	gb	but it needs to be something with an example that works on all versions and i think cygwin has some idiotic differences to linux in that respect
2015-08-20 22:36:26	Phil21	is there a way to set a channel to not show up in the hotlist?
2015-08-20 22:36:51	@FlashCode	yes you can change its notify level
2015-08-20 22:37:04	Phil21	well, I want it to still set the proper color in the bufferbar
2015-08-20 22:37:07	@FlashCode	on the channel: /buffer notify highlight  (to get only highlights in hotlist)  or /buffer notify none  (never)
2015-08-20 22:37:10	Phil21	just not have the hotlist in the title
2015-08-20 22:37:16	Phil21	hmm
2015-08-20 22:37:25	@FlashCode	this will affect both hotlist and buffers bar
2015-08-20 22:37:37	Phil21	any way just to affect hotlist and not buffer bar?
2015-08-20 22:37:39	@FlashCode	because buffers bar reads hotlist to know if the channel has activity
2015-08-20 22:37:41	@FlashCode	no
2015-08-20 22:37:43	Phil21	minor annoyance
2015-08-20 22:37:44	Phil21	ah well
2015-08-20 22:37:52	@FlashCode	if you don't use hotlist, you can remove it completely from status bar
2015-08-20 22:37:55	Phil21	guess it doesn't matter too much
2015-08-20 22:38:06	Phil21	yeah that's actually the best idea I think
2015-08-20 22:38:17	@FlashCode	/set weechat.bar.status.items [Tab]
2015-08-20 22:38:21	@FlashCode	then remove "hotlist" from list
2015-08-20 22:40:22	gb	you can also replace hotlist with buffers item from buffers bar if you want to ditch buffers bar com pletely
2015-08-20 22:40:58	@FlashCode	but it's better to have it in own bar, with a "column" filling (below status for example)
2015-08-20 22:41:38	+weebot	-git(core)- FlashCode: doc: remove trailing whitespace in Polish FAQ
2015-08-20 22:41:44	gb	i think it's better seperate too but just throwing an idea out there :)

2015-08-21 19:36:57	auk	sounds like the scripts need an infrastructure re-working?
2015-08-21 19:37:14	auk	well, the "scripts" plugin
2015-08-21 19:37:19	gb	not really just how scripts/plugins work hard for a script to rm settings if its not running anymore and sometimes you might just be upgrading so you don't want to trash the settings
2015-08-21 19:37:57	gb	plugins seem to leak memory less too
2015-08-21 19:38:07	auk	gb, oh i see
2015-08-21 19:38:17	gb	i wont mention the stalker script though :)
2015-08-21 19:38:34	auk	gb, earlier i was asking about script security (verification of downloads, etc)

2015-08-21 19:38:59	auk	gb: i think strayPuppy mentioned you about that
2015-08-21 19:39:18	gb	best you get is the ssl curl uses for the repo
2015-08-21 19:39:41	auk	gb: hmm that's disappointing

2015-08-21 19:40:24	gb	no that's good because before a script gets into that repo it goes through much testing by flash and others in here
2015-08-21 19:40:38	auk	do you know if there's any planned infrastructure for gpg verification etc
2015-08-21 19:40:41	auk	?
2015-08-21 19:40:51	gb	of course you can stil install unofficial scripts as well
2015-08-21 19:40:56	auk	gb: ok so the repo is centralized and verified
2015-08-21 19:41:23	gb	and fixed immediately if you have a bug found
2015-08-21 19:41:42	auk	ok good
2015-08-21 19:41:55	addaitech	hmm
2015-08-21 19:42:07	addaitech	dont see anything saying what i want to do
2015-08-21 19:42:32	addaitech	like under the network name in the left bar, it says weechat under it, how do i have it just show the chans, and not say weechat
2015-08-21 19:42:39	gb	usually by script author or a handful of others in here if the author is unable too before flash incorporates the fixes into the repo which is why it is pulled every /script run
2015-08-21 19:43:08	auk	there was this project i came across a while back that was providing tools and standards for lightweight secure pseudo-package management (can't remember the name of find the link, arrgh)
2015-08-21 19:43:24	gb	if you have a bandwidth issue for that you can set it to be a file and pull the repo manually yourself however
2015-08-21 19:44:01	auk	use-cases were like emacs packages, scripts and plugins for apps etc (stuff to small/quick changing for distro packaging)
2015-08-21 19:44:30	auk	gb: dunno if that would interest the weechat community?
2015-08-21 19:44:44	gb	i know nothing about emacs
2015-08-21 19:45:07	gb	i think flash codes in emacs though
2015-08-21 19:45:12	auk	gb: this wasn't emacs-specific, that's just an example
2015-08-21 19:45:36	auk	gb: the main thing is distributing sub-package-type-things that are distributed as source
2015-08-21 19:45:44	gb	well given i know nothing bout it, it's probably not a good example to refer me too :)
2015-08-21 19:45:53	auk	gb: yeah sry :)
2015-08-21 19:46:01	auk	i'll try to find the link
2015-08-21 19:46:30	auk	gb: kind of like python's pip, but application-specific (and language-agnostic) rather than lang-specific
2015-08-21 19:46:46	auk	gb: and security-focused, so better security than pip...
2015-08-21 19:46:50	gb	btw i am only a lowly user of weechat, i do no coding at all and have no influence at all in anything :)
2015-08-21 19:47:25	strayPuppy	lol
2015-08-21 19:47:43	auk	gb: ah i see :) i took you for an insider lol
2015-08-21 19:48:25	gb	i try to fend questions if i am able so flash/others can improve weechat instead :)
2015-08-21 19:49:08	strayPuppy	lets say gb is an experienced user of weechat :)
2015-08-21 19:49:22	auk	:)

2015-08-21 21:04:17	gb	if it's script relatedyou can check by starting weechat with -s after cloning your current config and use -d to point to cloned dir

2015-08-21 22:34:10	phroa	how should I go about setting buffers.pl's bar type to window vs. root?
2015-08-21 22:34:36	phroa	I actually tried unloading it, replacing 'root' with 'window' in the script, and loading it, and it's still a root bar
2015-08-21 22:47:29	@FlashCode	phroa: if you make a window bar, it will be displayed in each window split, is that what you want?
2015-08-21 22:47:41	phroa	I don't split windows
2015-08-21 22:47:51	@FlashCode	then just delete the bar and create a window bar with the same name
2015-08-21 22:47:54	phroa	I just want the input, status, and title bar to go over the top
2015-08-21 22:48:04	@FlashCode	no need to edit script, if the bar exists, the script should not create one

2015-08-21 22:48:47	phroa	I found a "root" string in bar_new or whatever. I didn't look at the perl api docs though.
2015-08-21 22:48:55	phroa	I assume it does what I expect :P
2015-08-21 22:49:26	@FlashCode	hmm no the option is just for toggling bar (show/hide)
2015-08-21 22:49:45	@FlashCode	phroa: you can do that in command line with /bar (see /help bar)
2015-08-21 22:50:17	phroa	I ran /bar del and /bar add buffers window right 20 yes "hi"
2015-08-21 22:50:30	phroa	totally blank, but it's a window bar at least :)
2015-08-21 22:51:33	phroa	reloading buffers.pl didn't refresh the contents sadly
2015-08-21 22:51:47	@FlashCode	this is not the good syntax
2015-08-21 22:51:59	@FlashCode	you must use exactly required arguments, and "buffers" as items

2015-08-21 22:52:26	phroa	one sec while I actually look at the script :P
2015-08-21 22:52:42	@FlashCode	buffers is the name of bar, and it has one item: buffers
2015-08-21 22:52:50	@FlashCode	better look at /help bar

2015-08-22 00:59:37	farn	FlashCode: what I meant is that right now, layouts are stored as one line per buffer/window, so you couldn't easily make that visible to /set

2015-08-22 01:00:01	phy1729	I don't mind editing the file manually

2015-08-22 01:07:26	phy1729	doesn't save spacing of splits
2015-08-22 01:08:46	@FlashCode	the window layout is a bit more complex
2015-08-22 01:08:54	@FlashCode	it also remembers what is the buffer displayed in each split
2015-08-22 01:09:03	@FlashCode	by its name
2015-08-22 01:10:04	@FlashCode	maybe another solution would be that weechat automatically reads ${sec.data.something} when the layout/filter/notify level is saved
2015-08-22 01:10:28	@FlashCode	hmm no just forget that it can not work
2015-08-22 01:11:06	@FlashCode	maybe a local var in buffer could be used to tell weechat which secured data contains the name of buffer
2015-08-22 01:11:39	@FlashCode	for example on irc.freenode.#weechat you could have a local var:  sec_name = wii
2015-08-22 01:12:10	@FlashCode	and then each time weechat creates a layout/filter/notify level for this buffer, it would use ${sec.data.wii} instead of irc.freenode.#weechat
2015-08-22 01:12:17	@FlashCode	a bit complex maybe :p
2015-08-22 01:13:05	@FlashCode	but why do you share your weechat.conf? :D

2015-08-22 01:27:42	rober	so the weechat android app an do it but weechat itself can't

2015-08-22 01:28:11	@FlashCode	weechat relay was designed to add (remote) graphical interfaces to weechat

2015-08-22 01:28:25	@FlashCode	if you need weechat to weechat, why not using screen/tmux?
2015-08-22 01:28:26	rober	yeah, qt-weechat works
2015-08-22 01:28:40	rober	but it would be cool to jzst use another weechat to plug into it
2015-08-22 01:28:46	gb	you got qt-weechat working?
2015-08-22 01:28:58	rober	yeah, but it's been a while
2015-08-22 01:29:00	@FlashCode	IMHO, less network layers is always better/faster
2015-08-22 01:29:09	rober	i didn't really need it, curses is fine
2015-08-22 01:29:29	gb	yeah lots want a curses relay client :)
2015-08-22 01:29:34	@FlashCode	maybe in future, but that's a low priority feature anyway
2015-08-22 01:29:43	gb	i prefer using it natively via screen/ssh though
2015-08-22 01:29:50	rober	FlashCode: weechat runs on a machine that's not reachable from the outside
2015-08-22 01:30:26	gb	thaT'S THE PROB WITH MY DEV SESSION PRESENTLY
2015-08-22 01:30:28	rober	and it would save 1 hop to connect to the machine that's reachable and then have another weechat there that's a relay
2015-08-22 01:30:28	@FlashCode	maybe that's your problem then ;)
2015-08-22 01:30:57	gb	that and crummy keyboards with caps lock not removed yet :)
2015-08-22 01:31:00	@FlashCode	or you could use an irc relay on this machine too (weechat, znc or other)
2015-08-22 01:32:09	rober	actually it's pretty neat to have your channels and buffer (including xmpp-connections) just there when using the relay
2015-08-22 01:32:35	rober	all logs go to one place and the world is a brighter place
2015-08-22 01:32:56	gb	hehe i can relate to that
2015-08-22 01:33:19	gb	especially with grep.py
2015-08-22 01:34:05	gb	it's insane trying to find info in email unlike weechat with grep :)
2015-08-22 01:35:41	gb	you could always push the logs out from the unreachable machine to some other place you can reach though
2015-08-22 01:36:19	gb	almost always better to just have weechat reachable though
2015-08-22 01:37:06	@FlashCode	rober: maybe in future, but this is low priority, and needs lot of work
2015-08-22 01:37:47	@FlashCode	rober: why not using a good client like glowing-bear? but I agree it's not curses

2015-08-22 02:40:45	gb	 if you are building on a deb i recommend adding a src line to your sources and then apt-get build-dep weechat-dev

2015-08-22 02:41:19	vladski	./msg -server FREENODE #weechat text
2015-08-22 02:41:21	vladski	that should work

2015-08-22 10:34:34	farn	sim642: those colors are set elsewhere. it could perhaps be the default for that. I'm not sure
2015-08-22 10:35:07	sim642	farn, what colors are set where? nicklist groups are used to group the nicks in the nicklists so OPs are above voices etc

2015-08-22 12:18:16	sim642	Nicd-, well I was just keeping the same relay stuff I had before, which obviously was SSL, I didn't expect it to break when getting tunneled
2015-08-22 12:18:58	isolatedvirus	the only reason it would have broke was due to DNS resolution not being setup properly.
2015-08-22 12:19:56	sim642	not sure, don't really care either :P
2015-08-22 12:20:12	isolatedvirus	you should always have split DNS setup if youre going to bother with hosting services anyway. thatway when youre local to your network you resolve weechat.mydomain.com as 10.0.0.1 instead of its external IP.
2015-08-22 12:21:02	sim642	you wish the proprietary ISP routers have custom hosts options...
2015-08-22 12:21:25	isolatedvirus	i host alot of stuff so making sure DNS is correct is a big thing. makes it easy to access things instead of all of this IP:PORT combos out there.
2015-08-22 12:22:05	isolatedvirus	sim642: split DNS is when you dost your own DNS for your domain, and only provide to your network.
2015-08-22 12:22:20	isolatedvirus	host*
2015-08-22 12:23:22	isolatedvirus	sim642: so if i was on my home network, weechat.homedomain.com resolves to 10.0.0.1, but if im outside of my network it resolves to the public address.

2015-08-22 12:24:16	isolatedvirus	so lets say im on my phone, and i come home. when my phone connects to my wifi it resets the connection, so weechat goes "Whats the ip for my weechat server?" my local DNS says "Here you go, its this private IP"

2015-08-22 23:16:42	sim642	packages are packages
2015-08-22 23:16:51	e_carter	I am using xchat right now (which I installed tediously) but evne this will be removed when I reboot
2015-08-22 23:17:20	e_carter	I have managed to install things like Electrum by simply having a folder in the Persistent volume and running it from terminal when I need it
2015-08-22 23:17:29	Mikaela	e_carter: https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#source_package
2015-08-22 23:17:37	Mikaela	XChat is not developed anymore and has multiple issues like missing SASL support and not supporting TLS (which means you cannot connect to most of networks and bouncers). You can use your current config with HexChat (instructions: http://goo.gl/qqnBsh). HexChat's homepage: http://goo.gl/HIQ6V0
2015-08-22 23:17:51	e_carter	But it seems when I try to do that for xchat there are missing libraries and configurations, and for Weechat...I don't even see an executable anywhere
2015-08-22 23:18:01	auk	e_carter, if you need a TAILS-compatible irc client you might want to try portable thunderbird / instantbird / or TBB + chatzilla
2015-08-22 23:18:27	auk	(if you need it immediately, to use)
2015-08-22 23:18:37	e_carter	Pidgin is also an option since it's already installed and enabled in TAILS, but my use case is Tor -> Proxy -> IRC
2015-08-22 23:18:47	e_carter	So I must torify it and pidgin isn't working from the command line
2015-08-22 23:18:49	sim642	e_carter, what Mikaela linked should be enough to compile it such that it resides whereever you choose on the disk
2015-08-22 23:18:54	sim642	after installation
2015-08-22 23:19:05	Mikaela	live operating system sounds like it will be entirely cleared unless you have different partition on the stick and install it there. http://brew.sh/linuxbrew might be helpful as the depedencies would get removed from apt
2015-08-22 23:19:12	auk	getting weechat to work on TAILS sounds interesting though :)
2015-08-22 23:19:13	e_carter	And I imagine any firefox plugins will not allow *seperate* proxification since they rely on internal Firefox settings
2015-08-22 23:19:34	e_carter	I will go here (https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#source_package) and ask questions as I go if you don't mind!
2015-08-22 23:19:42	e_carter	(I'm very new to all this)
2015-08-22 23:19:56	e_carter	1) WeeChat can be compiled with cmake or autotools (cmake is recommended way).
2015-08-22 23:20:29	Mikaela	e_carter: have you read https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html ?
2015-08-22 23:20:38	e_carter	When I use "cmake" at terminal, it is not found. I think Tails disables most dependencies and installation utilities as a part of it's "hardening" practice
2015-08-22 23:20:47	sim642	e_carter, you need to install a bunch of stuff to build
2015-08-22 23:20:49	sim642	look at the dependencies table below that
2015-08-22 23:21:05	e_carter	Yes, I am now familair enough with TAILS to run something in Persistence and understand risks etc, but I am not good when it comes to building things for example (coming from Windows background)
2015-08-22 23:21:07	sim642	depending on what you want your weechat to have, you must have some dependencies installed
2015-08-22 23:21:26	e_carter	okay so basically I just apt-get install the dependencies first,
2015-08-22 23:21:28	sim642	the -dev packages are only required for building, but you need non-dev packages for them to work runtime
2015-08-22 23:21:35	e_carter	then try to run a build command for weechat's source?
2015-08-22 23:21:44	sim642	there are commands below, yes
2015-08-22 23:21:50	sim642	with the option of choosing install path
2015-08-22 23:21:56	e_carter	ah so even later on when I want to run it, I would still need some of these potentially nonexistenting dependcies
2015-08-22 23:21:59	Mikaela	apt won't help you if everything installed from it gets removed on next reboot, WeeChat probably will complain about something missing
2015-08-22 23:22:11	sim642	e_carter, yes
2015-08-22 23:22:14	e_carter	So I won't use apt-get then
2015-08-22 23:22:40	e_carter	root@amnesia:/home/amnesia/Persistent# autotools
2015-08-22 23:22:40	e_carter	bash: autotools: command not found
2015-08-22 23:22:40	e_carter	root@amnesia:/home/amnesia/Persistent# cmake
2015-08-22 23:22:40	e_carter	bash: cmake: command not found
2015-08-22 23:22:40	e_carter	root@amnesia:/home/amnesia/Persistent#
2015-08-22 23:22:45	sim642	...
2015-08-22 23:22:52	sim642	install the dependencies first
2015-08-22 23:23:07	e_carter	I was just going to say, for cmake or autotools, I would only need that once right?
2015-08-22 23:23:09	Mikaela	e_carter: I would probably use http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/#installation the git clone method into somewhere persistent
2015-08-22 23:23:19	sim642	then follow "Compile with cmake" → "Installation in custom directory"
2015-08-22 23:23:31	sim642	or whatever that brew thing is
2015-08-22 23:24:46	Mikaela	homebrew is the missing package manager for OS X and Linuxbrew is fork of it for Linux meant for rootless environment and I think it also works in this case as after reboot it only needs adding the environent variables

2015-08-22 23:25:52	Mikaela	it currently seems to have just WeeChat 1.2, but as 1.3 was merged to homebrew 4 days ago, it will appear in Linuxbrew within week as they merge homebrew weekly
2015-08-22 23:26:48	sim642	I got thinking about another thing, apt should be able to use a different root dir too, no?
2015-08-22 23:27:16	Mikaela	I compile WeeChat by myself, but on this shell I use it for things like swig3 which isn't in Debian and ZNC wants it.
2015-08-22 23:27:16	Mikaela	No
2015-08-22 23:27:44	sim642	well, chroot would certainly work though for another setup or however TAILS does it

2015-08-22 23:46:12	e_carter	About pidgin: I need to torify pidgin and when I try to do that at the command line, I get a pidgin error.
2015-08-22 23:46:22	e_carter	It seems the only way I can run pidgin is by clicking the pidgin icon in TAILS
2015-08-22 23:46:29	e_carter	If I could torify an instance of pidgin, I'd be set!
2015-08-22 23:48:27	auk	e_carter: but when you click the pidgin icon in TAILS, it runs over tor
2015-08-22 23:48:49	auk	(cause everything in TAILS is torified. No?)
2015-08-22 23:50:02	auk	you don't need to run 'torify pidgin' from cli to get pidgin over tor, when you're in TAILS...)
2015-08-22 23:51:53	e_carter	auk, apologies for the confusion, the torification is necessary because I am using a proxy with the IRC client

2015-08-22 23:52:44	e_carter	Since that is impossible in TAILS otherwise, I need to first encapsulate the proxy fed IRC client in Tor instead of letting the client connect to Tor in its proxy settings
2015-08-22 23:52:50	e_carter	So whatever I run must work command line
2015-08-22 23:53:01	e_carter	and for that reason, whatever I set up must have persistence

2015-08-22 23:53:38	Mikaela	I would just install some other OS to USB stick with persistence and install tor and set environment so that everything uses tor, sounds a lot easier

2015-08-22 23:58:25	e_carter	I'd rather install from scratch every reboot to be honest.
2015-08-22 23:58:39	auk	but it seems like you could just configure pidgin to talk to the proxy... pidgin -> (tor) -> IRC proxy -> server. But i've never used an irc proxy so again maybe i'm missing something

2015-08-23 00:00:35	e_carter	What you're probably missing is that because TAILS requires Tor for all connections, the IRC client *already* uses the proxy configuration to connect through Tor
2015-08-23 00:00:46	e_carter	By changing that to the proxy instead, you are firewalled in
2015-08-23 00:01:02	auk	oh i see
2015-08-23 00:01:13	auk	so pidgin's proxy settings are set to a local torified proxy
2015-08-23 00:01:14	e_carter	I got xchat to connect here by changing it to the proxy settings I wanted and then torifying it commandline
2015-08-23 00:01:19	e_carter	Absolutely.
2015-08-23 00:01:25	e_carter	And if you change that, nothing connects
2015-08-23 00:01:38	e_carter	So if I could run pidgin torified, it would work of course.

2015-08-23 01:18:05	sim642	When changing my buffers.pl bar from bottom to left position for example or vice versa, it doesn't re-render the item right away, only until something like a buffer switch triggers it to
2015-08-23 01:18:34	sim642	But I'm not sure which is more at fault here, buffers.pl for not hooking onto that config change or weechat for not making things rerender when changing bars like that
2015-08-23 01:21:37	farn	the latter sounds reasonable
2015-08-23 01:21:43	sim642	it does indeed
2015-08-23 01:21:53	sim642	but bar items aren't supposed to depend on the bar positioning I think
2015-08-23 01:21:55	farn	why would buffers.pl have to keep track of all the bars that contain its item and hook into their position
2015-08-23 01:22:01	sim642	because multiple bars can contain the same item
2015-08-23 01:22:08	sim642	but buffers.pl only works with one
2015-08-23 01:22:10	farn	hm
2015-08-23 01:22:33	sim642	bar items have no idea how they are going to get displayed, they just return a string
2015-08-23 01:22:49	sim642	which buffers.pl constructs differently based on weechat.bar.buffers.position
2015-08-23 01:23:04	farn	oh, I see
2015-08-23 01:23:09	farn	then I blame buffers.pl!
2015-08-23 01:23:24	sim642	Due to that hardcoding I do too
2015-08-23 01:23:32	 *	sim642 will open an issue on buffers.pl then
2015-08-23 01:24:36	gb	sim642: you could rewrite buffers.pl as a plugin that'd fix it :)
2015-08-23 01:25:10	sim642	plugin or script, doesn't matter, bar items still work the same way
2015-08-23 01:25:22	sim642	unless I make my own implementation of bars...
2015-08-23 01:26:31	@FlashCode	sim642: I have no such problem here
2015-08-23 01:26:36	@FlashCode	I'll try with a default config to test
2015-08-23 01:27:03	@FlashCode	works fine with a default config
2015-08-23 01:27:48	sim642	I even looked through buffers.pl and it doesn't hook_config bar position
2015-08-23 01:27:49	farn	here it switches the display less than a second after changing the position
2015-08-23 01:27:54	farn	no buffer switch necessary
2015-08-23 01:28:06	@FlashCode	sim642: it shouldn't have to
2015-08-23 01:28:17	sim642	farn, anything which triggers it to rerender
2015-08-23 01:28:22	@FlashCode	when you change the position, weechat marks the whole bar as "refresh needed"
2015-08-23 01:28:34	@FlashCode	so it should auto-refresh in the next loop (in main function)
2015-08-23 01:28:52	@FlashCode	if it doesn't, it's a weechat bug for me (not buffers.pl)
2015-08-23 01:28:54	sim642	and bar refresh needed means all items must be refreshed?
2015-08-23 01:29:07	@FlashCode	but it would be nice if you have a way to reproduce, otherwise it's hard to fix
2015-08-23 01:29:15	@FlashCode	yes bar refresh will refresh all items
2015-08-23 01:29:29	@FlashCode	can you try with a default config and no other script loaded?

2015-08-23 01:32:49	sim642	and then use the bar in bottom position
2015-08-23 01:33:03	@FlashCode	and it's a root bar?
2015-08-23 01:33:06	sim642	when changing between that and left, indenting gets broken in buffers item
2015-08-23 01:34:08	sim642	oddly weechat shows different default values for filling_top_bottom
2015-08-23 01:34:27	sim642	I had both on default according to iset but one was created by an older buffers script apparently
2015-08-23 01:34:43	@FlashCode	I fixed the default filling recently
2015-08-23 01:34:50	@FlashCode	from horizontal to columns_horizontal (IIRC)
2015-08-23 01:35:07	@FlashCode	but this filling shouldn't cause any refresh problem anyway
2015-08-23 01:35:08	sim642	columns_vertical it says
2015-08-23 01:35:16	sim642	but it does make a difference
2015-08-23 01:35:25	@FlashCode	hmm yes columns_vertical
2015-08-23 01:35:41	@FlashCode	I tried this filling, still no refresh problem
2015-08-23 01:36:31	farn	I thought the bar setting defaults were whatever the value was when weechat was started?
2015-08-23 01:36:50	@FlashCode	no, bar settings are saved in weechat.conf
2015-08-23 01:37:01	@FlashCode	so if you change settings, they are used on next startup
2015-08-23 01:37:13	farn	yes, I mean the default value shown by /set
2015-08-23 01:37:14	@FlashCode	ah the default value shown in /help, yes
2015-08-23 01:37:25	farn	or /help or iset
2015-08-23 01:37:28	@FlashCode	yes the default value for bar options is the value in weechat.conf
2015-08-23 01:38:04	@FlashCode	so it's not very relevant

2015-08-23 02:13:04	sim642	is there a nice way to check if a server supports SASL?
2015-08-23 02:13:40	Mikaela	/wii saslserv, or /who saslserv, if they run Atheme and support SASL it's supported
2015-08-23 02:13:52	@FlashCode	sim642: /cap ls
2015-08-23 02:13:54	Mikaela	/ctcp nickserv version, if it's Anope it might support SASL
2015-08-23 02:14:04	Mikaela	oh, that works too, but it's /quote cap ls
2015-08-23 02:14:32	@FlashCode	ah yes, I thought I added /cap :p
2015-08-23 02:15:11	Mikaela	nyuszika7h or someone requested you to add it, but you said something about user not needing to use it manually

2015-08-23 06:27:55	ariver	Heya.. I'm looking to write a conditional alias/key-bind that clears the core buffer and newsbar. But I want it to check if I'm on the core buffer, and if not, switch to it, then clear the buffer, then switch back to the previous buffer.
2015-08-23 06:28:35	ariver	(The command { /buffer clear 0 } should work, but doesn't seem to.)
2015-08-23 06:29:19	sim642	/buffer clear weechat ?
2015-08-23 06:29:24	ariver	Oh, wait.. Nvm. Just tried { /buffer clear core.weechat } and that worked.
2015-08-23 06:29:42	ariver	Although, I would still like to know how to work out a conditional. =]
2015-08-23 06:29:51	sim642	conditional on what exactly
2015-08-23 06:31:15	ariver	Something that executes based on the result of { /eval -n -c ${window.buffer.full_name} == core.weechat }
2015-08-23 06:31:39	ariver	I'm thinking a trigger, but my mind is having trouble wrapping itself around the workings of triggers.
2015-08-23 06:31:58	sim642	I'm just wondering when you'd want something only executable in core buffer
2015-08-23 06:32:06	sim642	Why limit yourself
2015-08-23 06:32:39	@FlashCode	you can do a trigger "hook_command" with a condition on the current buffer
2015-08-23 06:32:47	@FlashCode	and as command, you clear what you want
2015-08-23 06:33:17	ariver	It's not that. The original problem was that "had" to switch to core buffer to do what I wanted. More generally, an operation that I only wanted performed on the core buffer.
2015-08-23 06:33:44	@FlashCode	you can clear a buffer without having to switch current buffer
2015-08-23 06:34:59	ariver	FlashCode: Interesting, ah yes, like the ones that catch the entry of password/keys.
2015-08-23 06:35:30	ariver	Also, I just realized that supplying the name of the buffer to 'clear' worked, thought the number didn't. Better the name anyway.
2015-08-23 06:38:11	ariver	Thx for the help! :D
2015-08-23 06:38:15	@FlashCode	you're welcome

2015-08-23 07:12:03	@FlashCode	you run /exec or /exec -sh? (the former is highly recommended)
2015-08-23 07:12:10	sim642	former
2015-08-23 07:12:38	sim642	the command is: /exec -norc -nosw notify-send -i weechat "${buffer.full_name}" "${tg_message}"

2015-08-23 07:13:10	@FlashCode	ah I see, it's because the ${} things are replaced before calling /exec
2015-08-23 07:13:31	grawity	aren't there already several scripts that do this more reliably
2015-08-23 07:13:37	@FlashCode	maybe we are missing another encapsulation of a command argument

2015-08-23 07:14:05	sim642	and every \ too ;)

2015-08-23 07:15:13	@FlashCode	no in default commands, but it's possible with /exec (not sure)
2015-08-23 07:15:56	sim642	because without a shell, I think it needs separate strings to pass as arguments to the new process, no?

2015-08-23 09:46:55	sim642	What exactly do you want to see? The channels from another server?
2015-08-23 09:47:01	Zarthus	by default the server buffers are merged, if that's what you mean
2015-08-23 09:47:07	Zarthus	you need to use CTRL+X to switch to the other.
2015-08-23 09:47:08	LeransGP	yes
2015-08-23 09:47:16	sim642	Press ctrl-x to swap between merged buffers
2015-08-23 09:47:21	sim642	and execute /join in another server
2015-08-23 09:47:33	sim642	or /buffer unmerge to unmerge them into separate buffers
2015-08-23 09:47:45	Zarthus	you can configure them to be independent, you can also look into installing buffers.pl, you might like both.
2015-08-23 09:48:04	sim642	buffers.pl will give you a good idea of whats happening with your buffers
2015-08-23 09:48:27	Zarthus	i don't think buffer unmerge works on servers which are merged by the option
2015-08-23 09:48:30	Zarthus	don't quote me on that
2015-08-23 09:48:55	LeransGP	and how can I chang the f11 buttom config? because when I want to see the list users I can't move, becaus this button it's for a full frame

2015-08-23 12:21:11	phealy	Hey all, a quick question. I'm on a few channels with bots that will randomly say something if the channel is idle for a while. Is there a way for me to mark a nick to be ignored for activity only? In other words, I still want to see the messages in the buffer, but I don't want them to count as active lines if they're from "abot" or "bbot"

2015-09-19 21:45:33	strayPuppy	so you need to re-configure your terminal, to not use it.

2015-09-19 22:57:53	IanHulett	Maybe it's because I'm trying to save in a terminal.

2015-09-19 23:12:52	sim642	you aren't supposed to edit weechat config directly
2015-09-19 23:13:16	sim642	also, are you running weechat as root or something?
2015-09-19 23:13:38	sim642	because you shouldn't have problems writing your home directory

2015-09-19 23:14:37	--	dsirijus is now known as synthmeat
2015-09-19 23:14:59	sim642	what's the path of the config files
2015-09-19 23:15:22	sim642	and what are the permissions on them
2015-09-19 23:16:10	IanHulett	They're in the ~/.weechat directory
2015-09-19 23:16:19	IanHulett	As for permissions, I dunno.
2015-09-19 23:16:34	IanHulett	I was editing them just fine, but suddenly they stopped saving.
2015-09-19 23:16:56	sim642	check the permissions
2015-09-19 23:17:41	sim642	because if editing as root worked it might indicate you have no write permission on them for some reason
2015-09-19 23:18:05	IanHulett	Well, apparently it's back to not working.
2015-09-19 23:18:33	IanHulett	Because I changed "buffers.hidden" from "on" to "off"
2015-09-19 23:18:37	IanHulett	then saved...
2015-09-19 23:18:49	IanHulett	when I tested weechat, the buffers still hid...
2015-09-19 23:18:54	@nils_2	as sim642 said, don't mess with config files directly. use /set command or /iset script
2015-09-19 23:19:00	IanHulett	then I went back to the file and found out it went back to on.
2015-09-19 23:19:20	sim642	it never changed in the file
2015-09-19 23:19:25	IanHulett	I tried the /iset and /set commands but none of them worked.

2015-09-20 00:25:17	VxJasonxV	Changing my tmux config to use xterm-256color has solved all of those issues with other apps, but now weechat misbehaves by not erasing replaced lines, scrolling awkwardly, etc. I have to very regularly ^l and even clear the terminal (iTerm, Mac OS X) + ^l in order to get new content to properly render.
2015-09-20 00:25:51	VxJasonxV	I was told to change $TERM back to screen-256color, but doing that breaks my ability to input certain characters. like (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ︵┻━┻

2015-09-20 01:40:50	RainbowAsh	Good morning
2015-09-20 01:40:58	@nils_2	hello RainbowAsh
2015-09-20 01:42:49	RainbowAsh	I'm trying to compile weechat 1.3 on Ubuntu 14.4 LTS, and running into some dependency problems: I can't install the prerequisite libcurl4-gnutls-dev while libgcrypt20-dev is installed, because the former has libgcrypt11-dev as prerequisite itself.
2015-09-20 01:42:55	RainbowAsh	Can someone help?
2015-09-20 01:43:21	sim642	interesting because I've compiled it just fine on 14.04 LTS
2015-09-20 01:44:21	sim642	oh, I have no libgcrypt20-dev installed at all
2015-09-20 01:44:28	@nils_2	why not using the ubuntu packages RainbowAsh ?
2015-09-20 01:44:33	@nils_2	!ubuntu
2015-09-20 01:44:33	+weebot	Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian builds: https://weechat.org/download/debian/
2015-09-20 01:44:40	sim642	it seems to have compiled just fine with libgcrypt11-dev installed
2015-09-20 01:45:39	RainbowAsh	nils_2, I would prefer that, but for some reason aptitude shows 0.4.2 as the newest version for weechat-curses instead of 1.3
2015-09-20 01:45:51	sim642	RainbowAsh, did you set up that repo?
2015-09-20 01:45:54	sim642	and update apt?
2015-09-20 01:46:14	sim642	because ubuntu's own repos have outdated version while the repo linked has never versions
2015-09-20 01:46:29	RainbowAsh	sim642, the one weebot just linked?
2015-09-20 01:46:35	sim642	yep
2015-09-20 01:46:43	@nils_2	you'll have to add the repo. you have an instruction at bottom of page RainbowAsh
2015-09-20 01:46:46	RainbowAsh	All right, how do I add that repo?
2015-09-20 01:46:51	sim642	RainbowAsh, scroll down, pick distro, follow guide
2015-09-20 01:46:55	@nils_2	you'll have to add the repo. you have an instruction at bottom of page RainbowAsh
2015-09-20 01:47:09	sim642	is it just me or the instructions should be put at the top
2015-09-20 01:47:13	RainbowAsh	Ah, I see. Thanks.
2015-09-20 01:47:22	sim642	because people never seem to realize there's instructions when that page gets linked
2015-09-20 01:48:40	@nils_2	there should be an very large arrow at top of the page (maybe blinking!) with the text: instructions bellow :-D
2015-09-20 01:48:56	sim642	or just move the instructions to top
2015-09-20 01:49:11	 *	nils_2 prefers the arrow solution :-)
2015-09-20 01:49:13	RainbowAsh	Found it. ^^
2015-09-20 01:49:19	sim642	anyone who doesn't want the instructions will be able to do something useful with the long list
2015-09-20 01:49:44	sim642	when people go to the page they're struck with that massive list they don't exactly understand nor know how to use
2015-09-20 01:50:14	@nils_2	+1
2015-09-20 01:50:54	@nils_2	and you can choose the distribution within the instruction text

2015-09-20 01:57:47	DavidFromBE	guys, don't know wether if it's a Weechat issue (probably not) but anyways : I cannot participate in #screen. I get the following message : #screen: Cannot send to channel
2015-09-20 01:58:09	sim642	are you identified? maybe the channel requires that
2015-09-20 01:58:19	gb	it's because you are banned/muted or similar

2015-09-20 01:59:25	gb	in some cases people who are pratts might have got your domain a blanket ban, not very common though
2015-09-20 01:59:27	DavidFromBE	thanks I'll try that

2015-09-20 03:34:00	berceanu	i skipped the nick, username and realname parts and just changed sasl_username and sasl_password
2015-09-20 03:34:14	berceanu	now, while it does login succesfully to freenode, the nick I have is my linux username
2015-09-20 03:34:30	berceanu	how come?
2015-09-20 03:34:31	Zarthus	that's intended.
2015-09-20 03:34:36	Zarthus	you didn't specify an username
2015-09-20 03:34:37	sim642	you need to still specify nick
2015-09-20 03:34:53	berceanu	but i logged in with my registered freenode nick right?
2015-09-20 03:34:54	sim642	sasl is used for identification but it doesn't set nick, I think
2015-09-20 03:34:58	Zarthus	no, berceanu
2015-09-20 03:35:02	Zarthus	you just identified to your account
2015-09-20 03:35:04	sim642	you can also identify without being under your actual nick
2015-09-20 03:35:11	Zarthus	weechat does not know what your nick, user or realname should be.
2015-09-20 03:35:12	berceanu	oooh
2015-09-20 03:35:18	Zarthus	so it takes it from your geckos in linux
2015-09-20 03:35:19	berceanu	ok i see
2015-09-20 03:35:38	berceanu	so i need to set
2015-09-20 03:35:41	berceanu	wait
2015-09-20 03:35:49	berceanu	do i need to set nick or username?
2015-09-20 03:35:53	berceanu	im a bit confused
2015-09-20 03:35:54	Zarthus	ideally you don't skip any of the instructions :)
2015-09-20 03:35:56	sim642	setting nick should work
2015-09-20 03:36:02	Zarthus	nick is for your nickname, username is for your ident
2015-09-20 03:36:29	Zarthus	berceanu!~berceanu@unaffiliated/bananabas :berceanu => nick!user@host :realname
2015-09-20 03:36:30	berceanu	ok but there is "/set irc.server.freenode.username "My user name""
2015-09-20 03:36:53	sim642	that's just the indent, not your nickname
2015-09-20 03:37:17	berceanu	yes but then there is also
2015-09-20 03:37:18	berceanu	irc.server.freenode.sasl_username
2015-09-20 03:37:21	berceanu	which i did set
2015-09-20 03:37:25	Zarthus	not the same
2015-09-20 03:37:47	berceanu	is sasl_username the same as username?
2015-09-20 03:37:52	Zarthus	it's your nickserv account name
2015-09-20 03:38:02	berceanu	or do i need to set both
2015-09-20 03:38:10	Zarthus	yes
2015-09-20 03:38:12	sim642	username can be anything
2015-09-20 03:38:14	berceanu	yes, ok, i understood i need to set the nick
2015-09-20 03:38:20	berceanu	but apart from that
2015-09-20 03:39:16	berceanu	ok, so, i do

2015-09-20 07:29:51	Zarthus	indexed and completion for banlists
2015-09-20 07:30:32	Zarthus	https://weechat.org/dev/ it's already planned, but has been shoved off for a while. I'd just like to make sure it gets in sooner rather than later :)
2015-09-20 07:30:54	sim642	I've thought about it too
2015-09-20 07:34:31	Zarthus	if I can speed it up / guarantee it's availability, i'd really like to. if not, well, I have nothing better to give my money to :P
2015-09-20 07:34:42	sim642	when implemented properly it could also work with +e and +I, not just +b list
2015-09-20 07:35:53	Zarthus	this is weechat, i have yet to find something that boggles my mind :P
2015-09-20 07:35:54	@nils_2	i think you'll have to wait Zarthus. FlashCode becomes father not long time ago and has less time for weechat
2015-09-20 07:36:04	Zarthus	ah, i see
2015-09-20 07:36:16	sjl	does weechat's plugin system have a way to intercept outgoing messages (ones that don't start with a /command of some kind)?
2015-09-20 07:36:31	Zarthus	sjl: from you, or others?
2015-09-20 07:36:35	sjl	Zarthus: from me
2015-09-20 07:36:39	sim642	sjl, hooks should allow you to do something
2015-09-20 07:36:50	sjl	I am often an idiot and type "b foo" instead of "/b foo" when trying to switch buffers
2015-09-20 07:37:00	sjl	and end up spamming some random channel with "b foo"
2015-09-20 07:37:02	sim642	you don't need a plugin for that, just a trigger
2015-09-20 07:37:17	sim642	triggers are directly based on hooks though
2015-09-20 07:37:35	sjl	hmm
2015-09-20 07:38:09	sim642	Zarthus, I've thought about implementing such mode lists and their indexing but I'm not exactly sure how it should be done
2015-09-20 07:38:22	@nils_2	or install go.py script and make a shortcut like alt-g sjl

2015-09-20 07:39:00	sjl	and my fingers hit return before my brain parses that I missed the first char

2015-10-02 08:24:52	^^nidan^^	this isn't necessarily a weechat question but maybe someone has advice, I use weechat through screen connected to a remote shell account. I'm being disconnected often (ssh disconnects), however I have another ssh session that doesn't get disconnected (only the one on IRC gets DC'd), any idea why? Am I joined to too many channels maybe? (~10)
2015-10-02 08:27:01	Zarthus	10 channels certainly isn't "too much"
2015-10-02 08:27:46	Zarthus	could be distance between you and the ssh server with a wonky provider. It might be useful (but I won't claim to know how exactly) to provide traceroutes to both servers
2015-10-02 08:28:21	Petzku	^^nidan^^: You have weechat running in an ssh session being run inside screen?

2015-10-02 08:46:10	Zarthus	but yeah - if it's all the same servers I'd think it's more of an idle timeout rather than actually a network derp
2015-10-02 08:46:12	^^nidan^^	thanks I'll try some traces or winmtr
2015-10-02 08:47:17	Zarthus	it could be that your isp doesn't like the constant open traffic has and forcibly disconnects you i  suppose - but that's sometimes that's more of a guess than a statement.

2015-10-02 13:58:34	maurer	Considering switching from irssi+screen to weechat in order to use weechat-android, does anyone know if weechat-android supports the SSL relay?
2015-10-02 13:58:50	maurer	(the weechat-android docs don't seem to mention ssl config)
2015-10-02 13:59:17	sim642	weechat-android can do very different kinds of relay
2015-10-02 13:59:25	sim642	raw, ssl, websocket, ssh
2015-10-02 13:59:57	maurer	OK.
2015-10-02 14:00:12	maurer	I mean, my goal is to have an irc session similar to what I have now with irssi, but be able to connect to said session using my phone
2015-10-02 14:00:20	maurer	it looks like weechat may allow me to do this with an ssl relay
2015-10-02 14:00:34	sim642	weechat relay is what you're looking for
2015-10-02 14:00:43	sim642	be it over SSL or any other configuration
2015-10-02 14:01:04	sim642	the underlying connection is the same, different transport protocols can be used

2015-10-02 14:28:55	Petzku	la_mudri: press enter?
2015-10-02 14:29:04	la_mudri	Enter is ctrl-M.
2015-10-02 14:29:05	sim642	Petzku, I think those are the binds for enter
2015-10-02 14:29:13	Petzku	ah, I see...
2015-10-02 14:29:16	sim642	la_mudri, close weechat, modify the config file directly to fix it
2015-10-02 14:29:34	sim642	ctrl-M should be /input return
2015-10-02 14:29:54	la_mudri	Thanks.
2015-10-02 14:30:01	sim642	also, whenever you bind something get the proper keycombo using alt-k
2015-10-02 14:30:21	sim642	not only is it useful to know keycodes for weird keys but it shows if something else is bound to it already
2015-10-02 14:31:27	strayPuppy	so, does that mean if I re-bind ctrl-J and ctrl-M, I would lose my enter key?
2015-10-02 14:31:41	sim642	yes because they /are/ the enter key
2015-10-02 14:31:53	sim642	you can always try if you're willing to :P
2015-10-02 14:32:18	sim642	When you use alt-k and press enter, it shows up as ctrl-M most likely
2015-10-02 14:32:25	la_mudri	I think ctrl-J isn't enter, hence I had that rebound without noticing.
2015-10-02 14:32:36	strayPuppy	nope, I'll take your word on it sim642
2015-10-02 14:32:43	sim642	la_mudri, terminals are weird, it might be on some terminals or something
2015-10-02 14:32:57	sim642	there are other keys too which are meant for the same thing but have numerous default binds

2015-10-02 14:33:08	sim642	because terminals produce different codes for the same combo
2015-10-02 14:33:17	la_mudri	I guess there's return vs enter, too.
2015-10-02 14:34:15	[spoiler]	o
2015-10-02 14:34:18	strayPuppy	too weird, those options should be hardcoded or something so that, that mistake can't happen.
2015-10-02 14:34:43	[spoiler]	I tried now and ^J and Return generate the same code. Interesting
2015-10-02 14:34:47	sim642	!can weechat rebind everything?
2015-10-02 14:34:47	+weebot	Yes, weechat can do that!
2015-10-02 14:37:03	sim642	I once made a script which allows unbinding all keys at once among some other more useful things :P
2015-10-02 14:38:20	strayPuppy	here's a project for you sim642 , https://github.com/weechat/scripts/issues/100
2015-10-02 14:38:47	sim642	I saw that one get linked earlier
2015-10-02 14:39:18	sim642	if I knew perl it's probably be quite easy to port the script
2015-10-02 14:39:36	sim642	remaking a similar buffer interface would be effort
2015-10-02 14:39:53	strayPuppy	btw, I like what you done with buffer_autoset.py ,thanks
2015-10-02 14:40:00	sim642	I've thought about that listbuffer should have such interface too
2015-10-02 14:40:11	sim642	listbuffer's current listing is not that nice as iset's
2015-10-02 14:40:14	sim642	all bold etc...

2015-10-02 20:19:40	gb	of course the more you annoy flash with ideas in here the less time he spends in coding so it's a trade off

2015-10-20 17:19:21	Raku	Ya but your client would still drop
2015-10-20 17:19:38	abyxcos	Raku: You say that like it's a problem.
2015-10-20 17:19:45	Raku	I mean
2015-10-20 17:19:46	WeeDummie	my old irc box storage died and i lost my old config so i just want to know how to remove the space before every line so url's begin on the next line

2015-10-20 17:20:01	Raku	You'd either have to have the app open all the time
2015-10-20 17:20:05	WeeDummie	also i had the suffix and prefix set for < and > around nick, but can't remember how to get rid of the indent before nicks either
2015-10-20 17:20:17	WeeDummie	anyone remember how to turn either of those spacings off?
2015-10-20 17:20:24	Raku	Or you'd just have to not know if someone was trying to talk to you if you wanted to do something else
2015-10-20 17:20:35	abyxcos	Ya know, I just set all that up last month, WeeDummie, but now I forget...
2015-10-20 17:21:05	WeeDummie	hehe
2015-10-20 17:21:09	abyxcos	Raku: I think most of them have some kind of support for push notifications for that purpose.
2015-10-20 17:21:13	Raku	Ya
2015-10-20 17:21:18	abyxcos	WeeDummie: I still have some documents up, give me a minute to page through them.
2015-10-20 17:21:19	Raku	But if your client drops it cant do that
2015-10-20 17:21:35	abyxcos	Raku: That's the opposite of what push means/does...?

2015-10-20 17:22:52	WeeDummie	thanks
2015-10-20 17:22:59	abyxcos	WeeDummie: Which indent before the nick are you talking about? There's two actually.
2015-10-20 17:23:07	WeeDummie	both, actually
2015-10-20 17:23:23	abyxcos	WeeDummie: Do you mean the right-aligned setting, or that space where you would normally see modes (+@%)?
2015-10-20 17:23:38	WeeDummie	right aligned
2015-10-20 17:23:55	abyxcos	Because it took me way too long to figure out how to turn that space on so the modes lined up with un-voiced people :/
2015-10-20 17:24:07	WeeDummie	dang
2015-10-20 17:24:30	abyxcos	The color diagram doesn't cover everything, just a heads up.
2015-10-20 17:24:37	abyxcos	I should have made a new one from my notes...
2015-10-20 17:24:41	WeeDummie	no worriea
2015-10-20 17:24:48	WeeDummie	still helpful!
2015-10-20 17:26:32	abyxcos	weechat.look.prefix_suffix is that | between the nick and the playing field.
2015-10-20 17:27:54	abyxcos	WeeDummie: Also, if you do something like /set *option*, you can search. I used that to work backwards from the keywords in that diagram.
2015-10-20 17:28:12	Raku	You can also use iset

2015-10-20 17:28:39	abyxcos	WeeDummie: I think weechat.look.prefix_align may be the alignment for the nick.
2015-10-20 17:29:12	abyxcos	I've found iset to be harder to use than wildcards.

2015-10-24 13:43:16	abyxcos	It's gotten past the point where I can understand the restrictions, so I'm leary of touching any code under it.
2015-10-24 13:44:04	abyxcos	gpl3 has even more text than gpl2. Theoretically, it doesn't change the spirit of the license, but it adds more restrictions.
2015-10-24 13:45:26	abyxcos	There's still plenty of new code being released under the gpl2. In practice the distinction is important.

2015-10-24 14:43:42	TJ-	abyxcos: I was on about the GPLv3. Without it, copyright law applies. That restricts doing anything with the code. The license provides for distribution, which removes rstrictions that are the default in law.
2015-10-24 14:44:28	abyxcos	TJ-: Well, the update from GPL2 to GPL3 is even more onerous to me.

2015-10-28 08:23:45	yeled	anyone got a hint about why emoji is being stripped from irc -> weechat -> iterm?
2015-10-28 08:23:53	yeled	if i use glowing-bear, i can see the emoji
2015-10-28 08:23:58	yeled	i wonder what my term is doing wrong
2015-10-28 08:25:09	Evropi	I think glowing bear uses a library to render emoji
2015-10-28 08:25:36	squirrel	qstrahl: I use a simple automation script on windows that presses shift for me in terminal window
2015-10-28 08:25:56	Evropi	oh nvm yeled it's part of the browser
2015-10-28 08:25:59	squirrel	I don't know if linux can easily do that
2015-10-28 08:26:15	Evropi	yeled: you need to ask iterm developers do add support for it it seems, as it's unicode now
2015-10-28 08:26:22	qstrahl	squirrel, I have great mouse support in most of my terminal applications, so I don't really want to send the mouse events directly to the terminal if I can avoid it
2015-10-28 08:26:37	yeled	iterm does it..
2015-10-28 08:26:40	yeled	ill experiment
2015-10-28 08:26:42	Evropi	though there are workarounds which use icons locally
2015-10-28 08:26:46	Evropi	at least in browsers
2015-10-28 08:26:49	 *	Evropi uses glowing-bear too
2015-10-28 08:27:12	yeled	glowing bear can render, or just pass through
2015-10-28 08:27:13	yeled	i thik
2015-10-28 08:27:14	Evropi	but yeah, android supports emoji system wide for instance so all apps have emoji support basically out the boxto my knowledge
2015-10-28 08:28:31	Nicd-	yeled: I have a blog post about how to enable emoji

2015-10-29 16:50:20	strayPuppy	1. autojoin.py only writes the config option

2015-10-29 17:18:31	Orioa	click on tilda and it automatical runs weechat
2015-10-29 17:20:29	abyxcos	I suspect you want something that automatically starts a tmux session and runs weechat in it on computer start/login, then tilda just running "tmux a" to attach to the screen.
2015-10-29 17:21:00	abyxcos	If you're using vixie cron (or one that supports @reboot), @reboot /usr/bin/tmux new -s irc /usr/local/bin/weechat
2015-10-29 17:21:22	abyxcos	Else you can just put the tmux command in your .xinitrc or your desktop startup files, or wherever makes you happy.
2015-10-29 17:21:35	 *	strayPuppy still wonders why weechat doesn't quit normally.

2015-10-31 13:23:24	@nils_2	Remram: i tested with buffers.pl. it will show you if the channels is active or not
2015-10-31 13:23:36	gb	the other option which is probably the better option agan is to use a certificate

2015-10-31 13:28:58	SkepticalParrot	Is there a setting that allows me to color the text in weechat?
2015-10-31 13:29:22	SkepticalParrot	For example something in iset.
2015-10-31 13:30:55	gb	iset hs it's own colour settings yes
2015-10-31 13:31:47	SkepticalParrot	But I mean coloring the main text.
2015-10-31 13:31:48	gb	just /iset iset.color
2015-10-31 13:31:56	SkepticalParrot	For example...
2015-10-31 13:32:04	SkepticalParrot	in my tty terminal... the main text color is white.
2015-10-31 13:32:09	SkepticalParrot	I want to set that to green.
2015-10-31 13:32:12	gb	if it aint in there then no
2015-10-31 13:32:35	gb	it is also dependant on your TERM setting
2015-10-31 13:32:59	gb	if it is set to vt100 for example then weechat can do nothing with the colours
2015-10-31 13:33:09	SkepticalParrot	Oh.
2015-10-31 13:33:18	SkepticalParrot	Well. I'm using a tty terminal for manjaro.
2015-10-31 13:34:18	gb	typically xterm,screen or xterm-256-color,screen-256-color weechat can play with the colours usualy
2015-10-31 13:34:43	gb	but it's still a feature the term in use has to support as well
2015-10-31 13:34:49	Nicd-	SkepticalParrot: here are all the different color settings you can change: http://anti.teamidiot.de/static/nei/*/Code/WeeChat/weechat-color-settings.png
2015-10-31 13:35:26	Nicd-	you might be looking for weechat.color.chat
2015-10-31 13:35:47	Remram	Can I configure a window to not have title/window list/input bars?
2015-10-31 13:35:59	gb	yes
2015-10-31 13:36:13	Remram	I don't see the point of repeating all of these bars
2015-10-31 13:36:30	SkepticalParrot	Nicd- Yes... thank you.
2015-10-31 13:36:32	SkepticalParrot	I got it now.
2015-10-31 13:36:38	gb	look at /iset conditions
2015-10-31 13:37:02	SkepticalParrot	And thank you too gb.
2015-10-31 13:37:50	gb	checkout /color sometime too
2015-10-31 13:38:01	Remram	I tried /bar set input type root
2015-10-31 13:38:06	Remram	but it doesn't work
2015-10-31 13:38:15	gb	it will display a buffer with colours you can use and displays TERM, etc as well
2015-10-31 13:38:50	gb	you can change s window bar to root and vice versa
2015-10-31 13:38:53	Remram	"iset" is not a command or an option
2015-10-31 13:39:16	gb	i think you still need to delete/add it
2015-10-31 13:39:34	gb	/script install iset.pl
2015-10-31 13:39:47	Remram	What is it?
2015-10-31 13:39:59	Yaniel	Interactive /SET
2015-10-31 13:40:20	Remram	What's the point of that?
2015-10-31 13:40:51	gb	so you need not come in here and ask questions which iset will answer for you
2015-10-31 13:41:07	Nicd-	Remram: it can show you all the settings
2015-10-31 13:41:12	Nicd-	many people like the interface more
2015-10-31 13:41:17	gb	it also displays /help for all settings
2015-10-31 13:41:37	Remram	If iset is a requirement to do stuff and to get help, why make it a third-party thing?
2015-10-31 13:41:50	Nicd-	it's not a requirement
2015-10-31 13:41:57	Nicd-	I don't use iset
2015-10-31 13:42:15	gb	because like weechat-plugins it is not really essential to using weechat
2015-10-31 13:43:14	Yaniel	I have heard a builtin version of iset is in the works
2015-10-31 13:43:18	gb	i chat to a friend on the same vm who runs wee 1.0 whilst i user installed 1.1.1 with plugins
2015-10-31 13:44:15	gb	typically he only uses it to irc me and one other person so anything else is unnecesary
2015-10-31 13:44:54	Remram	ok got iset doesn't really help
2015-10-31 13:45:03	gb	i've been trying to get him to install plugns/iset for years :)
2015-10-31 13:45:11	Remram	I can't hide bars from specific windows?
2015-10-31 13:45:28	Remram	and I can't change the 'type'?
2015-10-31 13:45:44	gb	you can you just add a cndition as per the help for the bar setting
2015-10-31 13:46:12	Remram	A condition on which window it's in? I guess
2015-10-31 13:46:14	gb	same deal with buffers
2015-10-31 13:46:23	Remram	Is there a variable for the window name/number?
2015-10-31 13:47:04	gb	i do not use more then one window but i know it's possible
2015-10-31 13:47:16	Remram	I really need a highlight window
2015-10-31 13:47:54	gb	my guess is /window like /buffer would list all the window names
