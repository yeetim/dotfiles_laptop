2015-03-04 11:22:38	mirv_	Mantle
2015-03-04 11:22:48	mirv_	suppose they'll switch to DX12 now

2015-03-04 11:26:22	winter	Samsai, it's good. the combat is VERY similar to the Arkham games

2015-03-04 11:26:42	@Samsai	i never played any arkham games
2015-03-04 11:26:56	liamdawe	i liked the story
2015-03-04 11:27:02	liamdawe	and the game-play of mordor is excellent
2015-03-04 11:27:23	winter	Samsai: then: combat is very very satisfying (especially when you take on a hord of several dozen orcs without taking a scratch), but I personally felt like the open world nature of it was too busy
2015-03-04 11:27:31	liamdawe	how the hell can dying light have a big banner
2015-03-04 11:27:34	liamdawe	it's terrible still
2015-03-04 11:27:56	winter	i felt like parts of the story was very... ham-fisted. very fanservice-ish to the LOTR movies, and didn't take enough of the middle earth backstory into consideration
2015-03-04 11:28:14	winter	liamdawe: is it still? :( i hadn't heard in a while, and i'd still like to play it but i was hoping to wait til they fixed performance issues
2015-03-04 11:28:28	liamdawe	they haven't released a patch in nearly a month
2015-03-04 11:28:40	winter	blah
2015-03-04 11:28:43	@Samsai	maybe it'll be playable by the time vulkan comes out :P
2015-03-04 11:28:49	winter	maybe by the time it's on sale during the summer sale it'll be playable
2015-03-04 11:28:51	liamdawe	despite telling me it would have a patch last week
2015-03-04 11:28:53	FutureSuture	winter, that requires effort. This is an AAA title.
2015-03-04 11:28:59	liamdawe	then they replied saying they don't give eta's
2015-03-04 11:29:29	winter	i was very hesitant about the game anyway. i hated dead island.

2015-03-04 11:34:30	mirv_	damn it, what the hell have they done with TL2?
2015-03-04 11:35:33	xpander69	framerate is pretty poor for TL2
2015-03-04 11:35:33	disharmonic	Mantle ~= Vulkan
2015-03-04 11:37:05	liamdawe	saints row have updated their store page
2015-03-04 11:37:06	disharmonic	mirv_: Why would Oxide switch to DX12 when Vulkan is based on Mantle directly and is probably much more alike as an API
2015-03-04 11:37:15	liamdawe	"Saints Row IV will be available on SteamOS and Linux in 2015."
2015-03-04 11:37:26	mirv_	disharmonic, mantle used hlsl
2015-03-04 11:38:33	turol	vulkan should also be able to use hlsl
2015-03-04 11:38:47	turol	since shaders are compiled to bytecode it doesn't care what the source language was
2015-03-04 11:38:49	@Samsai	liamdawe, that's another confirmed port
2015-03-04 11:38:59	mirv_	turol, vulkan initially will be glsl only
2015-03-04 11:39:09	mirv_	other SPIR-V compilers might come online later

2015-03-04 11:41:13	liamdawe	The Witcher III is one of the only ones that doesn't
2015-03-04 11:41:44	disharmonic	Well, an announcement from Valve is pretty official anyway. Only issue is with games being ported by 3rd parties. they might not get any money for games purchased now, which would be rather unfair
2015-03-04 11:43:13	disharmonic	i also wonder why CDProjectRed would let Valve announce their linux port rather than do it themselves
2015-03-04 11:43:37	pdq	they announced support long ago didn't they?

2015-03-04 11:48:28	stqn	So, the Torchlight 2 demo works fine, except they broke alt-tab in fullscreen for some reason.
2015-03-04 11:49:03	liamdawe	a lot of games still don't alt+tab
2015-03-04 11:49:03	mirv_	I'm apparently the only one for which TL2 doesn't work
2015-03-04 11:49:08	liamdawe	you need to bring up the steam overlay
2015-03-04 11:49:10	liamdawe	then alt+tab

2015-03-04 11:50:22	mirv_	because of that little launcher window
2015-03-04 11:51:51	disharmonic	So do you guys think AMD will finally get some good performance on Linux once Vulkan becomes a thing?
2015-03-04 11:52:16	tadzik	keep dreaming :P
2015-03-04 11:52:31	mirv_	had enough of the auto-hate around here for tonight
2015-03-04 11:52:41	mirv_	performance is fine if people write proper damned code
2015-03-04 11:53:16	disharmonic	mirv_: I have AMD hardware only for years. Performance is not on par with DirectX
2015-03-04 11:53:49	mirv_	I didn't know directx ran under linux
2015-03-04 11:53:51	disharmonic	But, i'm pretty sure part of the issue is indeed devs optimizing mostly for Nvidia HW

2015-03-04 11:58:01	Sik	And the exaggeration was true some years ago
2015-03-04 11:58:07	Sik	OpenGL 3 forced AMD to get back on work on it

2015-03-04 11:58:49	liamdawe	well, a few high profile developers i've spoken to (and im not shitty you here), have said directly that when directing bug reports to AMD about OpenGL bugs, their replies are that AMD just doesn't give a crap

2015-03-04 12:02:01	FutureSuture	liamdawe, what game is this?
2015-03-04 12:02:03	Sik	Nvidia: buggy on the too lenient things, it'll let you do things that you shouldn't be able to
2015-03-04 12:02:08	liamdawe	Raven67854: f-off :D
2015-03-04 12:02:14	Sik	*too lenient side
2015-03-04 12:02:21	Sik	AMD: buggy on the too strict side, it won't let you do stuff that you should be able to
2015-03-04 12:02:37	Sik	Basically, but are horribly buggy, it's just that Nvidia is more forgiving so things still work
2015-03-04 12:02:45	Sik	*both
2015-03-04 12:02:51	Sik	What's with my spelling lately
2015-03-04 12:02:51	Raven67854	liamdawe, Not until mint gets security patches by default

2015-03-04 12:03:00	liamdawe	don't make me pull out some phoronix benchmarks
2015-03-04 12:03:01	mirv_	AMD expect people to fix their own code to conform to the spec
2015-03-04 12:03:08	mirv_	nvidia put workarounds into their drivers
2015-03-04 12:03:23	Raven67854	Hey
2015-03-04 12:03:27	Raven67854	Nvidia conforms to the spec just fine

2015-03-04 12:25:32	Raven67854	but PBR let's artists go wild and create really amazing things
2015-03-04 12:25:38	mirv_	Raven67854, nvidia allowing physx access...interesting
2015-03-04 12:25:44	Raven67854	mirv_, yep
2015-03-04 12:25:50	mirv_	but remains to be seen if it'll be allowed outside of UE4 for anyone too

2015-03-04 12:26:15	Raven67854	That will go back into physx mainline
2015-03-04 12:26:40	mirv_	but it's up to nvidia to allow a non-UE4 release
2015-03-04 12:26:45	mirv_	even a lib & headers

2015-03-04 12:27:33	Raven67854	But apparently mirv_ Physx's new GPU system Flex or whatever supports Cuda/DirectCompute/OpenCL
2015-03-04 12:27:45	mirv_	still, it's good for UE4
2015-03-04 12:27:54	mirv_	OpenCL would be cool for it
2015-03-04 12:28:21	mirv_	isn't bullet suppose to have OpenCL support now as well?
2015-03-04 12:28:28	mirv_	or is that still a wip?
2015-03-04 12:28:43	Raven67854	It's been WIP for like 3 years
2015-03-04 12:29:16	mirv_	heh, fair enough
2015-03-04 12:29:52	Raven67854	We'll see it someday!
2015-03-04 12:29:55	mirv_	wonder if hsa will allow for better gpu<->cpu (you know what I mean...I hope) physics
2015-03-04 12:30:04	mirv_	something more for interaction than eye candy
2015-03-04 12:30:05	Raven67854	mirv_, It's supposed to in theory
2015-03-04 12:30:28	Raven67854	But you know how theory and practice really plays out
2015-03-04 12:30:32	mirv_	yeah
2015-03-04 12:30:53	mirv_	won't happen until HSA fully takes off...and it'd need enough grunt to rival a dedicated GPU for that
2015-03-04 12:31:01	Raven67854	Yeah
2015-03-04 12:31:06	mirv_	(at least for gaming)
2015-03-04 12:31:13	Raven67854	But better interaction between GPU/CPU is a welcome
2015-03-04 12:31:27	Raven67854	Since a lot of physics stuff is handled by the CPU
2015-03-04 12:31:53	mirv_	I imagine there'll be a kind of hybrid physics solution eventually
2015-03-04 12:32:03	mirv_	"all this on the cpu, that over there is just gpu"
2015-03-04 12:32:05	Raven67854	Hybrid how?
2015-03-04 12:32:20	Raven67854	Physx already does certain tasks on GPU and others on CPU
2015-03-04 12:32:23	mirv_	I mean, they do that now, but I guess it'll go more user friendly in future
2015-03-04 12:32:31	Raven67854	One can only help

2015-03-04 13:40:28	mirv_	stqn, Legend of Grimrock is on sale right now, if you don't already have it
2015-03-04 13:40:33	Nothing_Much	mirv_: they're already like Apple
2015-03-04 13:40:44	Nothing_Much	they're proprietary, but they happen to support GNU/Linux
2015-03-04 13:40:45	stqn	mirv_: I have it, thanks.
2015-03-04 13:40:49	mirv_	Nothing_Much, yeah, you're right there
2015-03-04 13:41:17	Leftmost	The SteamOS sale has a hell of a lot of exciting news in it.
2015-03-04 13:41:27	mirv_	I know everyone's heard me say it before, but I'm just really concerned about linux gaming relying on valve & steam so much
2015-03-04 13:42:34	Leftmost	mirv_, I'm concerned about it too. My hope is that Valve will get us far enough along that we have enough momentum to carry on regardless of what happens to them.
2015-03-04 13:43:08	mirv_	Leftmost, I'm hoping it'll just be that developers will want to sell games on GOG as well
2015-03-04 13:43:29	tadzik	so, will my Torchlight 2 saves move from Demo to full version?

2015-03-04 13:44:12	mirv_	Leftmost, that would pretty much solve relying on a particular platform, given GOGs drm-free approach

2015-03-04 13:46:54	Leftmost	esd, a SteamOS sale.
2015-03-04 13:47:04	esd	ah ok
2015-03-04 13:47:06	Leftmost	Titles with current or future ports.
2015-03-04 13:47:22	esd	man gog.com has some insane sales
2015-03-04 13:48:04	Leftmost	Including Arkham Knight, Witcher 3, Shadow of Mordor and SR4.
2015-03-04 13:48:18	esd	that's nice
2015-03-04 13:49:00	mirv_	I'm still predicting at least a few VP titles in there
2015-03-04 13:49:20	Beamboom_	"VP"?
2015-03-04 13:49:23	mirv_	maybe some aspyr & feral ports (well, the latter is Shadow of Mordor definitely)

2015-03-04 14:28:20	Sik	(this was on imgur if you wonder)
2015-03-04 14:28:50	stqn	you need 32GB of RAM to do anything nowadays, y’know
2015-03-04 14:29:03	Happy-Ferret_	This is why I hate the vanilla kernel. Never had any lockups on my modified kernel with some Huawei patches.
2015-03-04 14:29:04	Sik	Fuck that
2015-03-04 14:29:06	Sik	Gimme 128GB
2015-03-04 14:29:28	Sik	Happy-Ferret_: more likely Gnome scaling up the hang up honestly
2015-03-04 14:29:40	Sik	Though it recovered after a few seconds... Firefox remained stuck though
2015-03-04 14:29:42	xpander69	http://i.imgur.com/2JXEIkX.jpg
2015-03-04 14:30:07	Happy-Ferret_	Sik, perhaps in your case. In mine, it was definitely the kernel. I couldn't even run more than two Flash videos in Firefox without crashing.
2015-03-04 14:30:21	Sik	OUCH
2015-03-04 14:30:45	xpander69	its all html5 now Happy-Ferret_ ..so no worries
2015-03-04 14:30:46	stqn	well flash crashing is kinda normal
2015-03-04 14:31:27	stqn	seriously… flash doesn’t crash much now that I have disabled hardware acceleration (which crashes with the nvidia blob)
2015-03-04 14:32:10	Happy-Ferret_	I know I sound kinda like Linus with that, but I seriously wish that the guy who did the mm on vanilla could come out, so I can beat him senselessly. Preferably by repeatedly crushing a giant ass printer on his head.
2015-03-04 14:32:44	xpander69	you cant have 60fps videos with flash i thought? why would anyone use that in youtube if theres option to use html5 which is just better in all ways

2015-03-04 14:34:11	Sik	HTML5 video is still pretty badly implemented (as in can be pretty damn slow, depending on the situation)
2015-03-04 14:34:19	Sik	In those cases better stick to Flash
2015-03-04 14:34:30	Sik	Also because of format compatibility shenanigans
2015-03-04 14:34:41	xpander69	so.. is the shadow of mordor good game? for the ones who dont like lord of the rings lore anyway?..is it playable with keyboard mouse nicely as well or more like controller crap game?
2015-03-04 14:34:42	Sik	Since nobody wants to agree on a format due to the whole patent issue
2015-03-04 14:35:30	xpander69	wait what... html5 videos are default now on youtube i think..and they are handled pretty good imo.. but you need flash for other sites still probably
2015-03-04 14:36:11	Happy-Ferret_	Anyone regularly talking to Liam, by any chance?
2015-03-04 14:36:23	stqn	oh nice, when you buy Torchlight 2 after having installed the demo, it doesn’t redownload 1.5GB :P

2015-03-04 14:37:36	xpander69	im on Chropera.. and its perfect
2015-03-04 14:38:25	xpander69	stqn, you need to enable some media.source flags in firefox if i remember correct... to make it work
2015-03-04 14:38:31	xpander69	but its not stable i think
2015-03-04 14:38:47	stqn	xpander69: I’ll wait then :)
2015-03-04 14:39:10	xpander69	you should try.. there have been updates in the mean time i think
2015-03-04 14:39:11	stqn	I’ve been using viewtube (greasemonkey script) and the videolan plugin for youtube anyway
2015-03-04 14:39:22	xpander69	my friend is using firefox with those flags and he dont complain
2015-03-04 14:39:25	xpander69	so i guess it works

2015-03-04 15:03:51	Sik	And I don't want wasting time setting up a VM, chroot or crosscompiler just for that
2015-03-04 15:03:56	liamdawe	xpander69: yep
2015-03-04 15:04:04	Sik	I mean, you can always just build from source, but still...

2015-03-04 15:08:44	stqn	Sik: I probably told you already but what I did was build my game and sdl, libpng, etc. under a xubuntu 10.04 VM
2015-03-04 15:09:19	stqn	debian 7 would work nowadays, it has the oldest glibc of the currently supported distros I think.
2015-03-04 15:10:02	Sik	"I don't want wasting time setting up a VM"
2015-03-04 15:10:06	Sik	That's the issue :P
2015-03-04 15:10:16	stqn	sure, but I don’t know of any other solution.
2015-03-04 15:10:26	stqn	that’s not a waste of time
2015-03-04 15:10:31	Sik	The real problem here is why the heck is the toolchain tied to the system
2015-03-04 15:10:32	Sik	Seriously
2015-03-04 15:10:51	stqn	I also have no idea why we need to do that
2015-03-04 15:11:23	Sik	The only real reason for it is that people were accustomed to build everything from source anyway so binary compatibility wasn't an issue and having the toolchain always available was a must
2015-03-04 15:11:42	Sik	But now that there's a larger adoption with users that want things to just work it's an issue
2015-03-04 15:11:44	Sik	:/
2015-03-04 15:12:27	stqn	it even sucks for opensource stuff, distro maintainers need to rebuild everything when a lib changes
2015-03-04 15:12:33	Sik	Doesn't help that there are many different package formats
2015-03-04 15:12:41	Sik	Otherwise just do one or two packages and you're done
2015-03-04 15:12:49	Sik	I'm considering for now sticking to .deb and whatever Arch is using

2015-03-04 15:14:00	Sik	Either I supply mine and there are compatibility issues (so crash), or I don't supply mine and I have to force everybody to install them manually since even that part isn't standard among distros (so I can't just cram it into a shell script)
2015-03-04 15:14:08	xpander69	zip doesnt keep executable permissions i think

2015-03-08 12:33:19	@Samsai	i can do one or the other
2015-03-08 12:33:31	mirv_	C++ lets you program how you want to program
2015-03-08 12:33:36	mirv_	...including "badly"
2015-03-08 12:34:03	@Samsai	c++ has some syntactic things i really dislike
2015-03-08 12:34:16	stqn	the great thing about C++ is you can open-source your code, no one will "steal" it because noone will be able to understand it anyway!
2015-03-08 12:34:38	@Samsai	defining functions for classes looks horrible
2015-03-08 12:34:43	mirv_	Samsai, so you found the STL
2015-03-08 12:35:02	@Samsai	and the input/output operations (<< and >>) are just weird
2015-03-08 12:35:15	mirv_	I try not to use those myself
2015-03-08 12:35:42	stqn	there’s nothing difficult about pointers btw. They are just addresses in memory.
2015-03-08 12:35:54	stuartm	Samsai: the actual syntax is horrible, or the need to declare them before defining them is horrible?
2015-03-08 12:36:12	@Samsai	stuartm, the actual syntax
2015-03-08 12:36:32	@Samsai	i've written C before and i've learned to deal with defining functions before declaring them
2015-03-08 12:36:49	stuartm	can't see that myself, but I guess it depends what you're used to

2015-03-08 12:42:55	@Samsai	depending on the song that is
2015-03-08 12:43:01	stuartm	I think C ++ is worth having on the CV, practically everyone who studied programming formally has Java on their CV, many many more have Visual Basic and it's ilk, but C++ is rarer and more highly prized
2015-03-08 12:43:04	liamdawe	pretty glad toms left/kicked out of blink now

2015-03-08 12:49:42	stuartm	Samsai: dunno, I dislike the fact that you can drop so much from it, syntax, even if it's redundant can help enormously with clarity, it expresses the intent so that others can actually follow your code and even spot errors you've made because it's clear what you meant to do

2015-03-08 12:50:27	stuartm	e.g. the implicit return, where you don't need the return statement - did you mean to leave it out, or was that a mistake?
2015-03-08 12:50:46	liamdawe	i dont know how T2 online works, do i use my existing guy tumocs ?
2015-03-08 12:50:53	stuartm	did you mean to call that function without arguments, or did you simply not finish typing the line?
2015-03-08 12:51:14	tumocs	liamdawe: I think so
2015-03-08 12:51:28	liamdawe	what difficulty are you on?
2015-03-08 12:51:32	tumocs	normal
2015-03-08 12:51:41	@Samsai	stuartm, a language can be minimalistic and understandable at the same time
2015-03-08 12:51:52	tumocs	I can start a new one on elite ironman if you wish so
2015-03-08 12:52:05	@Samsai	if you can't understand what something has written it means that there is something wrong with the code or you
2015-03-08 12:52:13	@Samsai	something?

2015-03-08 12:52:28	liamdawe	mmm my character is on the one above normal, so how would it work if i joined you? it's confusing tumocs
2015-03-08 12:52:48	tumocs	I have no idea
2015-03-08 12:53:01	tumocs	you can try or then we can create new characters
2015-03-08 12:53:52	stuartm	Samsai: well I think I'd disgree, I certainly wouldn't want to review an application of tens of thousands of LOC written in IO
2015-03-08 12:54:06	tumocs	to be honest, normal feels way too wasy
2015-03-08 12:54:20	tumocs	I don't think I was playing on this difficulty previously...
2015-03-08 12:54:46	liamdawe	yeah i re-did mine from normal to the one above
2015-03-08 12:54:47	stuartm	IMHO there's a difference between elegantly simple code and minimalist, you can have the former without dropping all the syntax from the language
2015-03-08 12:54:50	liamdawe	now it seems about right
2015-03-08 12:55:51	liamdawe	ah tumocs i think i just join in on your difficulty
2015-03-08 12:56:01	@Samsai	stuartm, well, if you drop all the syntax you no longer have a language
2015-03-08 12:56:09	stuartm	touche
2015-03-08 12:56:17	@Samsai	you need just enough syntax to get your message across
2015-03-08 12:58:18	stuartm	Samsai: right, I just don't think IO always gets that message across without ambiguity, not when it comes to debugging someone else's code
2015-03-08 12:58:42	@Samsai	stuartm, it's entirely possible
2015-03-08 12:58:51	stuartm	while it may be clear what the code will actually DO, that's not the same as knowing what the author meant it to do

2015-03-08 13:42:07	kon14	Kyrottimus, does it tear without compositing?
2015-03-08 13:42:07	esd	i hope the sale will run tomorrow as well
2015-03-08 13:42:16	esd	Kyrottimus: your nick sounds familiar, did you play Regnum Online?
2015-03-08 13:42:22	kon14	btw torchlight2 runs great on radeonsi too
2015-03-08 13:42:26	@Samsai	esd, it's going for 20 hours
2015-03-08 13:42:29	Kyrottimus	Cinnamon?  I have not tried, it's running compositing by default but I have a pretty beefy system
2015-03-08 13:42:30	@Samsai	so you still have time
2015-03-08 13:42:33	Kyrottimus	esd yes I did for like 4 years

2015-03-08 13:43:24	tumocs	liamdawe: very strange indeed, everything is fine. maybe the multiplayer can't handle those warp beast places for some reason
2015-03-08 13:43:32	esd	Kyrottimus: nothing, coding :D
2015-03-08 13:43:44	kon14	Kyrottimus, compositing is known to result in tearing sometimes. turning it off might fix it but I guess it cant help it if you like the effects :P
2015-03-08 13:43:47	Kyrottimus	very cool man, good to see you still in the linux heavy-like

2015-03-08 14:52:25	liamdawe	that was insanely hard tumocs
2015-03-08 14:52:36	tumocs	a bit tough yeah :D
2015-03-08 14:52:52	tumocs	it's not quite that bad if you are properly leveled
2015-03-08 14:52:55	liamdawe	i fear im going to be too weak when i play SP
2015-03-08 14:53:08	liamdawe	altho im not on elite on SP :D
2015-03-08 14:53:41	esd	ye what setting did you put liamdawe ?
2015-03-08 14:53:45	esd	i was like.. level 2-3
2015-03-08 14:53:48	esd	and my quest was lvl6
2015-03-08 14:53:49	esd	:D
2015-03-08 14:54:32	liamdawe	it was on elite
2015-03-08 14:54:33	liamdawe	hahaha
2015-03-08 14:54:37	esd	nice
2015-03-08 14:54:38	esd	:D
2015-03-08 14:55:09	esd	SO
2015-03-08 14:55:15	esd	editor got ported this time around or not? :D
2015-03-08 14:55:54	tumocs	doesn't look like it
2015-03-08 14:57:32	esd	:/
2015-03-08 14:58:37	tumocs	liam it should be possible to make a low level multiplayer game where you join with your current character and level up a bit
2015-03-08 14:58:52	tumocs	otherwise I think that we are screwed
2015-03-08 15:00:20	stuartm	though that can unbalance the SP game quite a bit, where it becomes so easy that it's boring - made that mistake, although I levelled up by playing some of the DLCs before completing the main game
2015-03-08 15:00:24	esd	would be nice if gw2 got a linux port
2015-03-08 15:00:31	esd	had a ton of fun playing that game
2015-03-08 15:02:14	tumocs	stuartm: but currently it's at point we can't even hit the enemies because we are so underleveled
2015-03-08 15:02:43	tumocs	I think i was at level 10 in 14-16 area
2015-03-08 15:03:01	tumocs	that gets a bit tough on elite :D
2015-03-08 15:03:10	stuartm	was thinking earlier that I'd love to see Rainbow Six 2 (rogue spear) on linux ... or something equally good, but more modern
2015-03-08 15:03:23	liamdawe	can u actually level up anywhere
2015-03-08 15:03:28	liamdawe	or once u kill an area is that it?
2015-03-08 15:04:19	tumocs	liamdawe: once you clear an area that is it
2015-03-08 15:04:51	tumocs	not having equally levelled group seems to be a huge problmen in that
2015-03-08 15:04:55	esd	stuartm: also blizzard games.. even tho they stated they have a working wow linux client for years now
2015-03-08 15:05:01	esd	but just didn't release a thing :S
2015-03-08 15:05:17	tumocs	I just want ARMA
2015-03-08 15:05:37	esd	XD
2015-03-08 15:05:52	stuartm	tumocs: my top three wishlist games for linux are Arma, Arma 2 and Arma 3
2015-03-08 15:05:55	tumocs	fuck I loved arma2
2015-03-08 15:06:01	esd	dno
2015-03-08 15:06:05	esd	only shooter i play is quake live
2015-03-08 15:06:10	stuartm	wouldn't be upset to see Operation Flashpoint again either
2015-03-08 15:06:30	tumocs	stuartm: as long as you don't mean the new one
2015-03-08 15:06:39	tumocs	god that was awful
2015-03-08 15:07:02	stuartm	tumocs: Operation Flashpoint ruined all other games for me, never got to play Arma as I'd switched to linux before it was released, but I'd cut off both my arms to play it on linux
2015-03-08 15:07:21	stuartm	tumocs: really? That's a shame ...
2015-03-08 15:07:56	tumocs	ofp dragon rising was one of the worst games I have played. It was a complete butchering of the OFP name

2015-03-08 15:08:15	tumocs	but in ARMA2 I had the most intense moments of gaming EVER
2015-03-08 15:08:25	stuartm	tumocs: yup, because it wasn't by Bohemia INteractive
2015-03-08 15:08:41	stuartm	cheap cash-in by Codemasters
2015-03-08 15:09:36	tumocs	yup, I knew that when I played it but I couldn't believe that it would be that bad...
2015-03-08 15:10:40	tumocs	in one night mission (moon/night was the same as day with a blue tint) where I was supposed to sneak I went to kill silently a guardpost with my friends
2015-03-08 15:11:13	tumocs	succeeded but it triggered an alarm and a tank and two squads spawned ontop of us because apparently we werent supposed to be able to do that...
2015-03-08 15:11:56	stuartm	I've even bought Arma, Arma2 and a couple of the expansions just to support Bohemia, despite there never being any prospect of them coming to linux (although there were always a LOT of people asking for it from day one)
2015-03-08 15:12:13	stuartm	tumocs: eww
2015-03-08 15:12:48	tumocs	and it was full of that kind of stuff
2015-03-08 15:13:05	tumocs	at release they were boasting with a map size many times the armas
2015-03-08 15:13:25	tumocs	but it could handle only maybe 30~ AI units at the same time
2015-03-08 15:13:45	tumocs	so they had to resort on spawns in the middle of the missions a lot
2015-03-08 15:14:16	tumocs	so when you did something other than walked straight line to a waypoint everything broke horribly
2015-03-08 15:14:54	stuartm	one of the things I liked most about Operation Flashpoint was that there wasn't really a right or wrong way, it was entirely up to you how you approached missions - if you wanted to spend an hour, heading miles out of your way to circle around behind the enemy you could do that
2015-03-08 15:15:25	tumocs	stuartm: yeah, that was kind of the whole point of those games
2015-03-08 15:16:01	tumocs	in ARMA2 we spent usually hours just approaching enemies undetected and planning the mission
2015-03-08 15:19:42	stuartm	in how many games can you have so much fun just by spawning in an empty map, jumping in a vehicle and going exploring/site seeing? Or building your own intricate set-piece battles (I liked nighttime tank/artillery battles just for the spectacle)

2015-03-08 15:21:30	esd	mmmh

2015-03-08 15:23:12	esd	well even quake live which is idtech3
2015-03-08 15:23:21	esd	yet it's newest title in the series
2015-03-08 15:25:15	stuartm	I graduated to Quake 2, then very quickly moved to Action Quake were I joined a clan and had lots of fun, before Counter Strike came along ... played that for a while, won myself a Razer Boomslang beating the PC Gamer team but lost all interest after a while
2015-03-08 15:25:31	esd	i only played csgo
2015-03-08 15:25:32	esd	while it's fun
2015-03-08 15:25:38	esd	i still prefer the fast pace of quake
2015-03-08 15:27:44	stuartm	there was a general trend in my gaming preferences towards realistic games ... I couldn't really go back to the fast pace, and insane ballet of Quake or UT
