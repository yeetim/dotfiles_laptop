2015-11-01 12:45:54	randomuser	axk4545, running two X servers is a big task for someone that probably hasn't looked at their volume slider

2015-11-01 12:51:42	axk4545	Plomos: also does game sound work if only the game is running?

2015-11-01 12:53:08	axk4545	Plomos: so it is a conflict between game and other app sound then.

2015-11-01 18:09:59	pollei	I'm running RC10 right now, working well
2015-11-01 18:10:06	edjix	ok, dumb question, I'm getting ready to install fedora, and notice that it has different versions now from when i used it before, workstation, server...that makes sense, but what is the cloud thing about?
2015-11-01 18:10:07	fenrus02	the iso was built earlier than that (obviously) but there's your "go" decision. you can grab that iso anytime.
2015-11-01 18:10:40	fenrus02	edjix, cloud images dont have *-firmware for example.  they dont need it.  just a different package selection specific to cloud environments
2015-11-01 18:11:32	edjix	"cloud enviroment", i.e. running the OS in a cloud, apps in the cloud, storage, or the whole thing?
2015-11-01 18:11:47	fenrus02	edjix, guests in a cloud setup.

2015-11-02 19:06:44	Kotoro[LAB]	@fedora-nvidia showed up on its own. I don't think its part of rpmfusion... so i'm a bit confused
2015-11-02 19:06:52	Kotoro[LAB]	not sure how I acquired it lol
2015-11-02 19:07:21	fenrus02	well, it certainly is NOT part of fedora.  it's something you did afterward.
2015-11-02 19:07:34	fenrus02	you will have to search for it and locate what package installed it.
2015-11-02 19:08:20	fenrus02	did  you do something stupid like install / run "fedy" or the like?  aside form breaking your system HARD - it also installs some wonky repos for you.
2015-11-02 19:08:46	axk4545	wait fedy is bad?
2015-11-02 19:08:54	fenrus02	heh.
2015-11-02 19:09:07	axk4545	so... yes?
2015-11-02 19:09:10	fenrus02	NOTHING about that is remotely classified as "good" by anyone that has read what it does.
2015-11-02 19:09:28	fenrus02	not even a little bit "good".  it'll royally screw  you HARD. every single tim.e
2015-11-02 19:09:42	fenrus02	if you ran it, good luck.  you'll need every bit you can muster.

2015-11-02 19:10:00	axk4545	ok. probably should undo it then.
2015-11-02 19:10:07	fenrus02	again, fedora does not ship broken junk like that.
2015-11-02 19:10:12	axk4545	I meant I should.
2015-11-02 19:10:15	fenrus02	"undo" .. you mean format?
2015-11-02 19:10:28	fenrus02	or perhaps i was unclear above.
2015-11-02 19:10:39	axk4545	no. rollback fedy stuff and uninstall it.

2015-11-08 03:21:27	theor	(even though that's quite ugly)
2015-11-08 03:21:46	muep	at least do not symlink it. libvirt allows you to specify extra locations without symlinking
2015-11-08 03:22:48	theor	the two symlinked folders are images and qemu, which stores the memory dump. i never saw an option to configure this last folder in virt-manager, hence the link
2015-11-08 03:23:04	theor	i'm googling it to see how to do it
2015-11-08 03:23:30	muep	if you really end up having to use symlinks, symlink just this one directory
2015-11-08 03:23:56	Khaytsus	And symlinks won't be liked by selinux afaik

2015-11-08 21:32:33	astubbins	I don't think that will help. My biggest problem is that when a download times out, dnf deletes what has been downloaded so far and starts over.
2015-11-08 21:33:19	Khaytsus	dnf _used_ to do that..  maybe your dnf is old?
2015-11-08 21:33:30	Khaytsus	Pretty sure someone brought htis up about a week ago.. hmm
2015-11-08 21:33:47	astubbins	Khaytsus: This is a fresh install of Fedora 23.
2015-11-08 21:34:04	wadester	On a fresh F23 install, the "software" tool will not install anything -- I entered a bad password.  For some reason it would not prompt for a password again so was useless.  It seems to have timed out and is working now....  Note that dnf worked fine from the command line.....  Is this normal?
2015-11-08 21:34:05	astubbins	Though, I haven't updated it yet. Maybe I should see if updating dnf helps.
2015-11-08 21:34:09	Khaytsus	That's odd then, because it should keep the files around as of some time ago.
2015-11-08 21:34:38	Khaytsus	wadester: Once it "timed out" it worked?
2015-11-08 21:35:34	wadester	it kept giving an error.  I gave up and went to the command line (my normal mode), and after about 20 min tried the GUI again and it worked
2015-11-08 21:36:03	wadester	I was installing simple scan, audacity, simple things like that.

2015-11-08 21:36:45	nirik	yeah, the current behavior of dnf is to keep things until a transaction finishes successfully...
2015-11-08 21:36:54	bodhi_zazen	astubbins, see man dnf.conf
2015-11-08 21:37:15	astubbins	bodhi_zazen: I don't see any obvious options in there.
2015-11-08 21:37:46	bodhi_zazen	keepcache
2015-11-08 21:37:58	nirik	but you shouldn't need to set it...
2015-11-08 21:38:45	bodhi_zazen	shouldnt. but might check
2015-11-08 21:38:55	Khaytsus	Nope, I think default is to keep them until completed or cleaned
2015-11-08 21:39:03	Khaytsus	ALthough the manpage for keepcache is quite confusing ;)
2015-11-08 21:39:22	nirik	it seems fine here...
2015-11-08 21:39:32	astubbins	bodhi_zazen: Does that apply to partially downloaded packages though? And if so, can they be fully downloaded then?
2015-11-08 21:39:37	nirik	"Keep  downloaded  packages in the cache. If set to False and packages have not been
2015-11-08 21:39:37	nirik	              installed they will still persist until next successful transaction. The default is

2015-11-08 21:39:47	astubbins	Anyways, the man page says the default is false.
2015-11-08 21:40:23	nirik	astubbins: 'rpm -q dnf' ?
2015-11-08 21:40:33	Khaytsus	Seems like keepcache=true would keep the cache ;)  I dunno, wording just seems very odd.
2015-11-08 21:40:58	nirik	keepcache=true keeps it forever or until you 'dnf clean' it.
2015-11-08 21:40:58	astubbins	nirik: dnf-1.1.3-1.fc23.noarch
2015-11-08 21:41:08	lsr	wadester: I also have trouble with the gui installer that comes up but I haven't investigated it and I've heard of others with similar issues.
2015-11-08 21:41:23	nirik	keepcache=false (default) keeps it only until the transaction works.

2015-11-08 17:32:37	tamarin	Or is that a red herring?  radeon is the OSS xorg driver and "rides on top" of amdgpu for supported cards, but I thought other distros had you enable an amdgpu driver for xorg.

Here we recommend you install nvidia drivers from rpmfusion http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/ when they are available. If you have integrated graphics you can use that until the package is ready assuming nouveau isn't working for you.

2015-11-09 02:20:49	horada	Hi, I dig into quite ugly behavior when installing fedora 22 or 23 (via kickstart) - through the installation the machine have different IP address then it get after the installation. It is the same machine (VM) with the same MAC address so it should usually get the same address from dhcp (it's not statically configured, but with older versions of fedora and with all versions of RHEL it works this way)... Is it expected behavior?

2015-11-09 17:25:58	PavestNavi	and I thought the little fedora logo loading was really cool
2015-11-09 17:26:05	tidux	well you need KMS for the shiny stuff
2015-11-09 17:26:09	PavestNavi	is there a way to make it work?
2015-11-09 17:26:09	tidux	and the nvidia drivers don't do KMS

2015-11-09 17:27:25	tidux	this is entirely nvidia's fault for not using KMS, take it up with them :P

2015-11-09 17:28:29	tidux	Also buy AMD for your next GPU.  amdgpu.ko and xf86-video-amdgpu are entirely FOSS, so they'll use KMS, even with the proprietary libGL and OpenCL

2015-11-09 17:28:47	tidux	it's just that amdgpu currently doesn't support reclocking so it's dog poop for performance
2015-11-09 17:28:51	PavestNavi	I'll go for amd
2015-11-09 17:29:02	PavestNavi	but until then, it seems like I'll have to deal with the ugly loading bar :(
2015-11-09 17:29:29	tidux	yeah, I'm in a similar situation, I upgraded to a GTX750Ti too recently to justify buying a new card

2015-11-09 20:25:59	devhen	if its latency/slugishness in the gui, its probably gpu related

2015-11-09 20:27:47	devhen	try booting another kernel. if the problem goes away, you might want to submit a bug report against the latest kernel

2015-11-09 20:28:12	devhen	sure but its if gui slugishness it could be a bug in the intel gpu driver which is part of the kernel

2015-11-10 06:41:28	randomuser	mathieu, sure - it would be just as easy to mount it at /var/lib/mysql - that's going to make selinux more viable
2015-11-10 06:42:07	mathieu	randomuser, yes. I see. I will need a relabel afterwards anyway
2015-11-10 06:42:27	randomuser	yes
2015-11-10 06:42:47	randomuser	and seriously, what kind of hosting provider kicks a raid0 as /home for a database server?
2015-11-10 06:43:24	mathieu	the original config is raid1 but I do fail to see why it is an issue in this case
2015-11-10 06:43:26	randomuser	that's appropriate for scratch space on a video editing workstation, but not a server
2015-11-10 06:43:37	mathieu	i.e., the duplication is synchronous on writes
2015-11-10 06:44:05	mathieu	so, corruption of the HD writes would need to happen all all 3 servers at the same time
2015-11-10 06:44:07	randomuser	mathieu, not an issue related to your inability to get a prompt or whatever - it's just a bad idea
2015-11-10 06:44:16	randomuser	slaves fall behind, that is their nature
2015-11-10 06:44:24	mathieu	they can't in this case
2015-11-10 06:44:44	randomuser	yes, even in a galera cluster
2015-11-10 06:45:20	randomuser	it's equivalent to not wearing your seatbelt and driving with non-functional breaks because you learned how to downshift during a defensive driving course
2015-11-10 06:45:41	randomuser	... anyway, it's time for me to head off and get paid for this kind of stuff, good lunk

It is not dependent on what is being updated, after the update, you are actually using the updated software rather than what is still in memory.

2015-11-11 12:36:56	khajvah_	Grinnz_ which doesn't make his statement wrong
2015-11-11 12:37:11	Grinnz_	i disagree, Ubuntu has many flaws
2015-11-11 12:37:24	Southern_Gentlem	ok i am going to put an end to this in this channel it can happen other places
2015-11-11 12:37:28	AdvaitaZen	So does Fedora.
2015-11-11 12:37:36	neildarlow	I suppose the answer is that my laptop becomes my primary machine until nvidia support xorg 1.18.
2015-11-11 12:37:50	Grinnz_	my priority is certainly not free software, and I have used Fedora for years
2015-11-11 12:38:08	Southern_Gentlem	Grinnz_,  AdvaitaZen  what did i just say
2015-11-11 12:38:12	bodhizazen	neildarlow: use FC22 or downgrade the X server or use the nvidia beta driver

2015-11-11 12:40:30	devhen	Grinnz_: supposedly some people have gotten the 358.09 beta driver to work. i can not get it to work no matter what i do and the fedora devs & people in the nv unix forums both say that *none* of the currently available nv drivers work with fc23 which matches my experiences
2015-11-11 12:40:51	Grinnz_	unless nvidia says that a driver supports 1.18.0 i would not assume it does

2015-11-11 12:41:13	khajvah_	AdvaitaZen, Ksplice is for Kernel right? I was talking about some safe way of updating the rest of the system without the need for "off line" reboot.
2015-11-11 12:42:14	Grinnz_	khajvah_: when updating the rest of the system, use the dnf "tracer" plugin to see what needs to be restarted
2015-11-11 12:42:25	AdvaitaZen	khajvah_: ideally, boot would simply be so fast you don't notice... it seems to be going the other way though...

2015-11-11 15:38:26	Luke_H	Has anyone ever experienced this issue before?

2015-11-12 15:14:16	randomuser	ciscam, the bootloader and related files appear as files in a fat filesystem; the uefi menu entry directs the firmware to load specific bootloaders.  If you saw a grub menu then a fedora loading screen, you were looking at a luks unlock thing

2015-11-12 17:37:08	neldogz	devhen, i understand the process is as simple as zeroing out the superblock on each raid member..some articles describe having to fail the disk first.
2015-11-12 17:37:28	devhen	or just yank the thing out
2015-11-12 17:38:23	devhen	but yeah. mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --remove /dev/sda is what you would normally do
2015-11-12 17:38:49	devhen	but the whole point of raid1 is one of the disks can die without bringing down the array
2015-11-12 17:39:21	neldogz	devhen, If possible I would like to remove the array completely and the disks function independently
2015-11-12 17:39:30	devhen	so you can just yank the thing out and it will be fine. cat /proc/mdstat will show a dead drive. put a new one in, mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdX to add it

2015-11-12 17:46:07	FrozenFire	An install of Windows to a separate disk seems to have somehow nuked the bootloader on my F23 disk. All of the F23 system partitions are there, but the bootloader shows the Windows one for that disk. How might I go about restoring grub?
2015-11-12 17:46:19	FrozenFire	Oddly, this is a UEFI install, so I didn't even think there *was* a bootsector
2015-11-12 17:47:17	FrozenFire	So far I've booted a sysrescuecd install and done grub2-install on the disk with the EFI partition mounted and specified as the root partition

2015-11-12 20:56:05	atrus	ie, not fedora.
2015-11-12 20:56:12	fenrus02	el5 != fedora ..
2015-11-12 20:56:27	atrus	not rpm-based at all...
2015-11-12 20:56:38	fenrus02	use docker or lxc then.
2015-11-12 20:57:00	fenrus02	unless its a kmod
2015-11-12 20:57:16	atrus	if selinux really can't accomodate this, that was my plan, but i'd rather stick to the ludicrously light-weight solution i know if i can.
2015-11-12 20:57:36	fenrus02	selinux + lxc or docker works fine ..
2015-11-12 20:58:11	atrus	also, is sharing content between host and lxc containers actually easier? last time i tried to run a debian lxc container, i ran into lots of selinux issues. granted, that was a long time ago.

2015-11-12 21:18:06	atrus	it's less about it not building, it's more about validation. just as an example, different versions of valgrind being able to detect different sets of errors, and making sure that i can simulate the same kind of build and pass exactly the same tests as someone else's work will run through on a build server.
2015-11-12 21:18:41	randomuser	ok, I can see the value in that
2015-11-12 21:18:53	atrus	different compilers and different linkers and different libraries resulting in a different pattern of memory allocations, different optimizations that cause allocations to not happen at all in some cases :)

2015-11-12 21:20:23	atrus	for x years, the chroot solution has actually worked really nicely. eventually something more dockerish/lxc-ish will be the answer, but i'm not sure if i want to make that switch just right now

2015-11-12 21:23:12	fenrus02	for selinux, it entirely depends on the policy. i have no comment on what $other_distro's selinux policy is .. but in fedora - there are specific items for kvm / lxc / docker / nspawn / etc..
2015-11-12 21:23:29	atrus	as it happens, for some other weird build/simulation-reasons, i do have selinux disabled on that machine *anyways*, so the cost/benefit of switching approaches right now is tenuous.
2015-11-12 21:23:46	atrus	(yes, those have to be dealt with for other reasons eventually)
2015-11-12 21:23:57	fenrus02	so the entire premise of your question was off.  XY problem.  got it.
2015-11-12 21:24:29	randomuser	atrus, you're getting AVCs specifically from /home?  and you need to reuse your $HOME in this controlled build system solution?
2015-11-12 21:24:35	atrus	well, i was hoping to knock off this one reason, if i could find a simple enough way to do it, and learn a little more about selinux in the process.
2015-11-12 21:24:59	atrus	randomuser: AVC is an selinux violation, right?
2015-11-12 21:25:03	randomuser	yes
2015-11-12 21:25:39	atrus	randomuser: it's not actually the violation that's the problem right now, it's the mis-labelling of content that's in a home-directory, but also available in another location due to a bind mount.
2015-11-12 21:25:50	randomuser	..anyway, I'd probably throw the sources at buildbot, and have separate jobs to create native packages for each platform you care about, and builders running that platform to do the work
2015-11-12 21:26:22	atrus	if i could knock that one out (and get /home labelled correctly and consistently), i'd proceed to look at what the actual selinux issues (violations or otherwise) i hit.
2015-11-12 21:26:29	atrus	(eventually)
2015-11-12 21:26:55	randomuser	a few days of startup, then it's a developer problem when things go wrong and not a buildsystem problem (mostly)
2015-11-12 21:27:26	underplay	I used "xinput --test 12" to see an event that i need blocked on my touchpad, the result is "motion a[0]=875 a[1]=826" i need to know how to block a[1]
2015-11-12 21:28:42	atrus	randomuser: that's more or less what we have, but with a homebrew, and somewhat awkward distributed build system. the same approach applies though, making that turnkey/automatic enough (docker maybe?), and let any dev spin up their own Authentic™ build environment
2015-11-12 21:30:04	 *	randomuser shrugs
2015-11-12 21:31:27	randomuser	there's nothing inherent to docker that takes work out of development - unless you're deploying via docker

2015-11-13 21:04:45	jrobeson	once i realized i almostnever open other programs except say steam occasionally.. i realized that the dock wasn't providing me any value at all
2015-11-13 21:04:59	Kellin	that's a good observation
2015-11-13 21:05:22	jrobeson	if i don't know the executable name, then i just press super and start typing a program name

2015-11-15 10:38:55	nwallace	Hey everybody. I'm new to Fedora and I'm a little confused about COPR vs the Open Build Service. I was looking for something like Arch's AUR to provide some packages I use for development that aren't in Fedora's repos (like leiningen, for example). COPR sounded like it would fit the bill, but there's no leiningen package in there yet. There are leiningen packages already in OBS, so then I wondered if that would be a better way to g

2015-11-15 14:12:25	daMaestro	it might break something else down the line that wanted those zones, but i would hope that firewalld would be smart enough to drop into the default zone... though that might not be what you want and might result in a truely insecure configuration

2015-11-15 16:12:00	ExoUNX	so libsolv is compiled and run natively
2015-11-15 16:12:38	daMaestro	http://hawkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference-py-sack.html is exposed to dnf so we can still have our awesome yum pgksack like interface (and other interfaces i would expect)
2015-11-15 16:13:16	daMaestro	yes, libsolv is native; have a look at `rpm -q --requires python3-dnf python3-hawkey`
2015-11-15 16:13:49	ExoUNX	so running libsolv natively is more stable than running it through CPython (bypassing the need for hawkey) correct?
2015-11-15 16:14:06	ExoUNX	and more effecient/faster
2015-11-15 16:14:56	daMaestro	i think you are missing the point of hawkey; at some point you need to balance the ability to iterate on features and ease of contribution vs performance. the heavy lifting is mostly done outside of python now
2015-11-15 16:15:32	daMaestro	while we can still add cool features to dnf, we have a stable interface provided by hawkey to do heavy lift stuff for us
2015-11-15 16:16:15	ExoUNX	daMaestro, right and C runs better than Python but with a package manager does it matter?

2015-11-15 17:59:07	rfk	my understanding is that NFS needs to be aware of this structure for some reasons
2015-11-15 17:59:09	daMaestro	ExoUNX, k, i've had that happen too, try rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau to see if that gets it done or not
2015-11-15 17:59:25	rfk	and so it needs to automatically mount those filesystems themselves as NFS mounts under the parent mount
2015-11-15 17:59:40	rfk	but i would have guessed that centos/fedora are pretty similar as far as the NFS client goes, but i really don't know how it works
2015-11-15 17:59:59	rfk	are there any relevant differences between the implementtion or default configuratino across these two distributions ?
2015-11-15 18:00:04	ExoUNX	daMaestro, so do rd.dr* and the nouveau.blacklist with no nomodeset

2015-11-16 20:33:25	sub_pop	is there a good way to get package name out of a spec file? rpmbuild -E '%{name}' doesn't appear to do it
2015-11-16 20:34:05	fenrus02	'repoquery -s packagename'
2015-11-16 20:34:44	sub_pop	sorry, i'm talking from a spec file i'm creating. not from an installed package
2015-11-16 20:35:10	fenrus02	rewind a bit then . . . your objective does not make much sense as stated above.
2015-11-16 20:37:01	mutk	rpmbuild -E must be a new arg I don't see on mine here. But I am in RHEL6..
2015-11-16 20:37:40	mutk	sub_pop, the spec file is a text file. View it like any other text file  perhaps.

2015-11-16 20:38:19	sub_pop	Right, sure. I'll rephrase. I have a spec file for a package I'm making. I'm writing a Makefile to more easily control the various stages of rpmbuild (-bp, -bc, -bi, -ba, -bs). I'm lazy and don't want to hard code the package name into the Makefile, so I was looking for a way to parse the package name out of the spec file. rpm -E (--eval) will evaluate macros, but it doesn't appear to evaluate the in-SPEC macros like %{name}
2015-11-16 20:38:40	fenrus02	$ awk '/^Name:/{print$2}' *.spec
2015-11-16 20:38:49	fenrus02	dont do that.  use mock instead.
2015-11-16 20:38:59	sub_pop	I could just grep & parse out the name value, but I was looking for a way to do it through rpmbuild.
2015-11-16 20:39:07	sub_pop	I use mock too.
2015-11-16 20:39:16	fenrus02	if you used mock, the above is not needed.
2015-11-16 20:40:13	sub_pop	mock still needs an SRPM from what I can tell.

2015-11-16 20:42:48	fenrus02	fedpkg clone -a packagename; cd packagename; vim *.spec .. and add your patch; rpmdev-bumpspec -c 'your comment here';  fedpkg srpm; fedpkg mock
2015-11-16 20:43:46	fenrus02	or make life difficult by not doing that.
2015-11-16 20:44:16	sub_pop	Um. So assume a package is not in the Fedora repos.
2015-11-16 20:44:30	sub_pop	And it looks like fedpkg srpm still builds a SRPM before using mock.
2015-11-16 20:44:56	sub_pop	So the TL;DR to your very-lengthy answer to my question is "No, just use awk instead"

2015-11-16 21:37:14	Polonel	I have a system that will not allow me to enter any mode but single user mode. This is a Fedora 21 box and was working okay until a "yum update -y" and then it entered into a failed to Start Login Service state. Upon further investigation I noticed it was unable to import network scripts from initramfs. I have searched google looking for an answer.

2015-11-20 16:03:05	Khaytsus	I remember when people used to theme grub.  I suspect you can theme grub2 as well, but soooo pointless.  I reboot, eh, monthly?  Maybe?  And I hide grub, as the only time I need to interact with it is if something is wrong and you can just hold a key for that.
2015-11-20 16:03:49	fenrus02	a "long bootup" is now about 7sec.
2015-11-20 16:04:09	fenrus02	normal is about 3.5 ..unless you have ssd.

2015-11-20 16:05:19	fenrus02	normally, you change GRUB_GFXMODE in /etc/default/grub then rebuild the conf and it just works.
2015-11-20 16:05:23	Hy93r10n	Systemd is my next target as I have 27 sec boot times

2015-11-20 16:06:31	fenrus02	did you rebuild the conf after modifying that file?
2015-11-20 16:06:37	fenrus02	if not .. it wont do much

2015-11-22 21:42:50	Motoko	Download Fedora server.
2015-11-22 21:43:04	Motoko	It's the "old" full install DVD.

2015-11-22 21:43:44	master	thanks very much
2015-11-22 21:44:02	Motoko	The "desktop" livecds are just an active desktop install making it easy for individuals to get up quickly.
2015-11-22 21:44:07	master	will that take a dump if i dd to bootable usb?
2015-11-22 21:44:39	Motoko	AFAIK, no.
2015-11-22 21:44:49	master	fair enough.  thanks again.
2015-11-22 21:45:07	Motoko	It's even supported as an option in the guide.
2015-11-22 21:45:25	mutk	master, Graphical installer +  full installer is getting too big. Its also very prone to bugs as you may recal. IMO doing a smaller live image installable spin is a better idea. Its a quicker install, and you can just add the bits you need after install

2015-11-22 21:47:30	master	i gave him the server full install iso
2015-11-22 21:48:26	Motoko	The workstation LiveCDs are usually a good start for "one-off" installs.
2015-11-22 21:48:46	Motoko	You can install anything else missing after you load to the HDD.
2015-11-22 21:49:17	Motoko	Full installer will be more inconsistent due to the ability to change a lot of things in the install process.
2015-11-22 21:51:41	master	i cant think of what id use a custom install for
2015-11-22 21:52:00	master	but good to keep in mind

2015-11-22 22:06:56	master	mutk: anyway the graphical installer isn't so prone to bugs if you guys were using SOLID OOP development to bring it all together, the installer itself should just be populating a class/object that performs an install once instantiated

2015-11-22 22:07:56	master	you're right about being too big, we're looking at an application that could have been small but is so large anyway that a whole rewrite would probably be needed to get it up to today's snuff

Last time I did this the web site had this short list on how to do it and after the fact I was told it was the wrong page. I want to be sure Im using the proper wiki page now.

2015-11-23 13:11:40	d0nn1e	its all about weighing risk and then mitigating. One idea would be to set up network bridging on your physical server, create a virtual machine and image with centOS, set up a samba share of the vids directly to the Virt, and spin up apache on the virt and host from it like it was just another computer in your closet.

After that I run HP-Device Manager from launcher and after that started to install plug-ins, but it doesn`t want to be installed. Plug-in installer is frozen every time. The most likely I did any mistake, who`s got the similar issue, help me, please. And also I tried to install hplip

2015-11-24 16:25:01	mutk	zebulan, Forcing a frozen program to quit in Fedora is generally no different to any other Linux.  We have the same process controls
2015-11-24 16:25:33	kk4ewt	zebulan,  what program
2015-11-24 16:25:53	zebulan	kk4ewt, PyCharm, I ended the process but the window is still open
2015-11-24 16:26:28	mutk	zebulan, If the GUI/graphical way does not work you can  look in a shell, issue a command like      ps auxkstart_time      look through the list and see if you can identify the frozen process(es)
2015-11-24 16:26:32	zebulan	mutk, ok cool. I have very little experience with linux. Only ubuntu for a while before
2015-11-24 16:26:41	Jordan_U	zebulan: How did you determine the process to end? Most GUI programs have multiple processes.
2015-11-24 16:27:13	zebulan	Jordan_U, I naively thought just closing pycharm.sh would work. looks like you are right.
2015-11-24 16:27:43	mutk	zebulan, In the list from the ps command is a process ID number..     kill -TERM nnn    where nnn is that number. But be careful and be sure you have the right process and the right number

2015-11-25 20:53:25	bitlord	leer10, have you tried to enable sshd and when it happens see if you can login remotely (if possible)? also is there anything interesting in logs after you reboot the system?

2015-11-25 20:57:40	bitlord	AmazingSkeeve_, like in regular fedora live images, when you go to the storage page, you need to select something like this "I'll configure partitioning" and it will allow you to create whatever you want   https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/23/html/Installation_Guide/sect-installation-gui-storage-partitioning.html
2015-11-25 20:57:53	leer10	jonas223 I think that you can edit the sudoers file so you can execute a specific command without having to enter a password
2015-11-25 20:58:34	jonas223	like if I open nautilus or nvidia-xsettings and then done some comfigurations or have a lot of nautilus windows open... on Ubuntu or the Mac, a popup dialog comes that says "Please enter your adminsitrative password"... where on Fedora/other linux, I need to go to the terminal and type pkexec/gksu and type the software.
2015-11-25 20:59:29	AmazingSkeeve_	Ok, I'll have to play with it. For some reason I'm not getting any prompts for the install at all, it just uses the livecd settings. But now that I know it *can* be done it is just a pebkac error.
2015-11-25 21:00:27	jonas223	annoyings like that is why it's' just easier to make everyone the administrator, like with Windows.. solution, just make them the admin.
2015-11-25 21:00:33	AmazingSkeeve_	bitlord, you are a gentleman and a scholar. Thank you!

2015-11-25 22:01:55	Demon_Fox	nn though

2015-11-25 22:02:05	fenrus02	Demon_Fox, good luck with that.
2015-11-25 22:03:32	epk	fenrus02, I'm thinking about whether I should try to restore the networking system to the state it was when fedora is first installed. i used to run the system on legacy network-scripts, but switched to NetworkManager in order to try to resolve the switch issues. switch crashes regardless of networking service used. So thought there might be more i could do to 'wipe' any changes i've made to the network system
2015-11-25 22:04:04	fenrus02	epk, did you use 'etckeeper' or the like to track your changes?
2015-11-25 22:04:24	epk	I didn't. sounds like I should have. hadn't heard of it
2015-11-25 22:04:48	fenrus02	try a live-media boot then.  see if it still crashes your switch.
2015-11-25 22:05:00	fenrus02	otoh, i'd call the place i bought it from and get it RMA'd
2015-11-25 22:05:16	fenrus02	switches should NEVER reboot based on some silly thing a user did.
2015-11-25 22:06:19	epk	live-media boot does not crash switch. humming along happily on fedora 20 live. =] yeah, i'll give linksys a call. this is kind of nuts. appreciate your help!
2015-11-25 22:06:43	fenrus02	f20-live != f23-live ..
2015-11-25 22:07:15	epk	switch has a really thin log that does not persist between boots. would have been helpful to get more information on what exactly is happening when it crashes
2015-11-25 22:07:32	fenrus02	does it have a syslog (remote logging) option?
2015-11-25 22:07:40	epk	i'll try f23 too
2015-11-25 22:08:48	bitlord	epk, actually that is not a switch?
2015-11-25 22:08:55	epk	there's a syslog viewer on its web interface. but it's not very verbose and basically just says 'ethernet up' or 'ethernet down'

2015-11-25 22:09:31	bitlord	at first when you said "switch" I thought a basic network switch, but you have something else, check for firmware updates
2015-11-25 22:13:41	bitlord	by looking at their website, there is only one firmware revision which was initial version, so you can probably skip that :\

2015-11-26 20:41:29	kaos01	or zone assigned based on source
2015-11-26 20:43:18	chder	So the public zone is already allowing all on whichever service you're trying to restrict?

2015-11-26 20:46:25	chder	Or just do the rich rule since you can do it in one command.

2015-11-26 20:55:31	kaos01	i looked at that, i can google :)
2015-11-26 20:55:59	mutk	Well now you know why add-source works
2015-11-26 20:56:02	kaos01	sure i did that , but than i decidd gee i only want certain ip ranges to access ssh
2015-11-26 20:56:02	chder	The public zone's default is only to allow all for ssh, mdns, and dhcpv6-client. Are you trying to restrict one of those?
2015-11-26 20:56:24	mutk	kaos01, I don't know whats so confusing..
2015-11-26 20:56:32	kaos01	ok
2015-11-26 20:56:44	chder	Then remove ssh from the public zone (after whitelisting yourself)
2015-11-26 20:57:18	kaos01	its not that its dificult , but first time so trying to learn how its intended to be used

2015-11-26 20:59:14	kaos01	sorry if im stupid thought i give all these new tools nmcli/firewalld a go today after a few drinks :)
2015-11-26 21:00:02	kaos01	on a server
2015-11-26 21:00:09	kaos01	to se ehow it goes :)
2015-11-26 21:00:10	chder	After you get yourself whitelisted, it sounds like you want to do this (or with --permanent and then reload): firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=ssh

As I said they read "To verify your image, start by downloading the proper CHECKSUM file into the same directory as the image you downloaded." But when I click it just opens up a file that displays the check sum...The way I interpret the instruction is I should get a file downloaded next to .iso.

2015-11-30 21:36:09	fenrus02	mutk,  <vbgunz> fenrus02: I dd'd one disk to another. the partuuid to the efi mount is the same as the original so I can't boot into it. I think if I can change the partuuid I should be able to
2015-11-30 21:36:11	vbgunz	thanks Alphakarem, I'll look into it
2015-11-30 21:36:35	fenrus02	just another reason that dd makes crap backups.
2015-11-30 21:37:15	vbgunz	mutk: yeah, I used dd to clone the disk. I already changed all the UUIDs and relevant fstabs. When either disk is unplugged, the other boots correctly. When they're both plugged in, only the first boots up.
2015-11-30 21:38:29	Alphakarem	vbgunz: silly question, have you tried a reboot in order to read/load the new UUIDs ?
2015-11-30 21:38:37	vbgunz	Alphakarem: I searched for partuuid on there, I couldn't find it
2015-11-30 21:39:21	Alphakarem	The last step on the link is supposed t change your UUID making it unique
2015-11-30 21:39:37	vbgunz	Alphakarem: changing the UUIDs only was fairly easy. I had to reboot to get them to ultimately take but one reboot was all it took and all was well. but the UUIDs are different than the partuuid. efibootmgr can only use the partuuid it seems
2015-11-30 21:39:38	mutk	http://linuxconfig.org/how-to-retrieve-and-change-partitions-universally-unique-identifier-uuid-on-linux  <-- This person is wrong. He's talking about changing partition uuid and suddenly uses tune2fs. That changes the file system uid :)
2015-11-30 21:42:01	vbgunz	It's not too big a deal atm, kind of sucks though I can't find the one program that should help with this
2015-11-30 21:43:47	vbgunz	gdisk, might be worth a shot
2015-11-30 21:43:54	mutk	vbgunz, gdisk sgdisk   The later has a randomize option to select a new UID for you
2015-11-30 21:44:20	mutk	vbgunz, Yes. I knew there was a tool for doing this - Could not remember it :(
2015-11-30 21:45:47	wwwd	fenrus02: I took that to be three commands separated by ";". When I do that the first reports pgp: Total number processed: 11 gpg: unchanged 11. the wget command saves a file verification-CHECKSUM. But the gpg --verify-files *-CHECKSUM returns "gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found" Did I miss understand?
2015-11-30 21:46:31	fenrus02	wwwd, the url i used was purely a sample.  copy / paste the url you had in your browser.

2015-12-01 20:50:26	innmalint	Can still continue and boot
2015-12-01 20:53:03	rj	from grub?

2015-12-01 20:54:02	PavestNavi	is there a way to download xf86-video-amdgpu on fedora 23 yet?
2015-12-01 20:54:12	PavestNavi	I mean install

2015-12-01 21:00:10	Alphakarem	I have the Yoga 900 laptop, would like to run Fedora on it
2015-12-01 21:00:33	Alphakarem	touchscreen and touchpad aren't working but some solution here (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1275718#c9) should work

2015-12-01 21:01:23	Alphakarem	so, I have tried building the module as mentioned by Kevin on this bug and it built fine however it's not loaded

2015-12-01 21:14:25	frotz47	as far as I know that needs kernel 4.3 or up...
2015-12-01 21:14:28	Alphakarem	kernel 4.4.0-0-rc2 is what I am using now on F23 and the wireless is working

2015-12-01 21:16:16	frotz47	then you are along for the development ride, all will come in time

Is there either a way to enable hardware rendering with it on the base drivers that come with fedora, or, do I need to install the  nvidia drivers from rpmfusion? so far, nothing seems to like wine with the nvidia drivers installed.
2015-12-02 10:34:36	striker	fmiz: I would think so
2015-12-02 10:36:37	fmiz	striker: ok, thanks. Not even having a log to submit is really annoying. If I did disable  kdump then  I was quite  high on something.

2015-12-02 18:51:43	basil1x	Is there a button or key combination to turn the trackpad on/off?  If so, try toggling it a few times.

The problem I have in fedora is that whenever I move windows or watch videos, I experience screen tearing issues. This does not happen in Ubuntu. What can I do in fedora to get this fixed? I am using Intel HD 5500 graphics.

2015-12-03 09:18:48	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan,  after all all those distros are downstream for fedora
2015-12-03 09:19:31	tytan	Southern_Gentlem: I haven't noticed selinux in Debian based distros yet. I'm getting curious about it.
2015-12-03 09:19:49	badbodh	amnix, well. the trick is to basically force vsync. so cpu load is to be expected. unless you have an antique PC shouldn;t be a problem.
2015-12-03 09:21:07	badbodh	i never got lag issues like you mention. you can remove the 20-intel.conf, reboot and check if tearing starts.
2015-12-03 09:21:18	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan, and debian isnt downstream for fedora now is it
2015-12-03 09:21:22	amnix	badbodh: Without adding that file, windows move in sync with the mouse cursor. After I've added the tearfree option, the cursor moves first and then the window follows a bit later. It's not really a big problem but it's annoying.
2015-12-03 09:21:41	Zord	tytan, you can set it up for Debian, if you want: https://wiki.debian.org/SELinux/Setup
2015-12-03 09:22:41	badbodh	amnix, you may remove the 20-intel.conf then, better tear than lag :D

2015-12-03 14:19:12	bitlord	can you check in journal (journalctl -b) for Xorg log, I guess it can be related to evdev driver xorg-x11-drv-evdev  (something like that), check which version you have, also do you have custom xorg.conf? (with input sections?)
2015-12-03 14:19:36	bitlord	Alt+SysRq+R  then try to switch to tty, does it work?

2015-12-03 14:43:43	--	memes is now known as gamma
2015-12-03 14:43:56	bitlord	Usurp, maybe better to do a "fresh install" if possible keep important data (also make backup first)
2015-12-03 14:44:37	bitlord	Usurp, other way is using yum ... to upgrade, but f18 is "too old"
2015-12-03 14:45:18	bitlord	and upgrading directly to some supported release can break your system (too big jump I guess, but maybe it can work, who knows)

2015-12-03 14:47:45	bitlord	Usurp, if you have a separate user data (/home) you can custom partition new fedora install, and do a fresh install keeping /home and data inside it
2015-12-03 14:48:09	bitlord	I cannot remember now, 1~2 releases, maybe more :S

2015-12-03 14:51:49	bitlord	I guess that was anaconda's decision, but if you upgrade regularly, you won't have any issues, yum/dnf, or fedup/(now)dnf-system-upgrade

2015-12-04 21:01:39	fenrus02	for what you did above, 'ss' is the replacement.  -t (tcp) -l (listening, completely optional above - not real useful, but does replicate what you had with netstat) -n (numeric) -a (all) -p (programs)
2015-12-04 21:01:53	fenrus02	dont know. you said it looks normal now .. so too late.

2015-12-05 07:27:36	fenrus02	instead, you want to measure "acceptable risk" levels to assess if the value of doing so outweighs the risk .. this is specific to your environment.

2015-12-05 08:22:51	gosang	savitr, if that directory exists, your system uses EFI. If it doesn't, it uses BIOS. As for your timeout problem: My /etc/default/grub only contains one timeout-related setting: GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 and it works as advertised. If you're on EFI, use Mac101's suggested grub2-mkconfig command, it has the correct path for grub.cfg on EFI systems

2015-12-05 08:42:14	gosang	So, my GNOME Shell has been very unstable ever since my upgrade to F23. Crashing randomly. Checking "journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell" reveals a ton of these errors: "shm_open() failed: No such file or directory" and "shm_open() failed: Too many open files". Also, some audio apps stop working after a while, i.e. Rhythmbox, with the same "shm_open failed" errors. How or where do I start debugging this? I've searched the web already, to no avail :(

2015-12-05 09:19:51	gosang	randomuser, I think I understand savitr's problem now: It's not the timeout, but the fact that grub stops at the boot menu (after the timeout), waiting for user input. this is probably related to GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT, which stops grub at the boot menu after power failure / failed boots

2015-12-05 09:23:35	randomuser	savitr, it sounds like you're trying to use the grub.cfg path for an efi system, but you don't have an efi system

2015-12-05 09:42:13	inascime	i believe you have to rebuild grub2
2015-12-05 09:42:23	inascime	after changing it
2015-12-05 09:42:36	gosang	fedpop, the way I understand it: Grub2 does not continue after the timeout, it just waits for user to press ENTER (which *can* be a feature after failed boots)
2015-12-05 09:42:45	savitr	you are lucky guys in that aspect. I just have to wait for hitting enter. Once I powered on,I should see the gnome  login. but, everytime, I have to hit enter. it is kind of irks me that it is there, but not working.
2015-12-05 09:43:02	inascime	1. Change Timeout 2. Rebuild grub: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
2015-12-05 09:43:04	randomuser	savitr, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/297745/49337321 is my unmodified /etc/default/grub.  Start with that, run grub2-mkconfig to regenerate the config

2015-12-05 09:43:20	fedpop	oh ok. sounds like its not related to GRUB_TIMEOUT then.

2015-12-05 09:45:04	randomuser	savitr, the only one you'd have to change might be GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
2015-12-05 09:45:26	gosang	yes, do not use someone else's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, use your own

2015-12-05 10:45:11	gosang	savitr, the command "grub-editenv create" clears (or recreates) an environment file used by grub. that sometimes helps to fix boot problems.
2015-12-05 10:45:40	savitr	some info like "--set=root 0b1aa062 ....."
2015-12-05 10:45:54	savitr	or like "root=UUID=432b1514- ...."
2015-12-05 10:46:31	savitr	i don't know completely about what info is kept  in that file like encryped root password
2015-12-05 10:47:03	randomuser	savitr, I do know, and I'm telling you there is nothing sensitive there, and we need to see all of it to help you
2015-12-05 10:47:09	gosang	savitr, I am a privacy-conscious person myself, but I agree with randomuser that grub.cfg does not hold much personal information. Feel free to remove the UUIDs, but they are generated randomly anyway and not tied to your hardware. There is no relation to your passwords.

2015-12-05 11:56:30	ezech	hi guys, I'm trying to run rfkill but it fails to see /dev/rfkill file (possibly because it's not there)
2015-12-05 11:56:52	randomuser	ezech, wifi trouble?
2015-12-05 11:57:09	ezech	randomuser, and it's a thinkpad, would you think that?
2015-12-05 11:57:31	randomuser	ezech, depends on which wireless module is in it... let's start there
2015-12-05 11:57:48	ezech	it's an intel 5300
2015-12-05 11:58:10	randomuser	ezech, are you able to connect with a wired interface and update the system?
2015-12-05 11:58:21	ezech	and I'm not really sure if I'm seeing things or not, but I remember it working for some time just after an install
2015-12-05 11:58:32	ezech	randomuser, I'm ircing from said machine, so yes
2015-12-05 11:59:06	randomuser	ezech, and all updates are applied, with a subsequent reboot? have you tried booting into each available kernel?
2015-12-05 11:59:39	ezech	oh, and it's an lenovo x200, os is up to date and rebooted many times today :)
2015-12-05 12:00:05	randomuser	same behavior with all kernels?
2015-12-05 12:00:21	ezech	I tried only the default one I think

2015-12-05 12:01:34	ezech	it's a 4.2.3-300.fc23.x86_64, right now lspci shows the device is present, but no modules regarding it are loaded so it's not visible on `ip a'
2015-12-05 12:01:44	 *	randomuser nods
2015-12-05 12:02:13	ezech	tried to modprobe iwlwifi but no module as well, I checked the intel-something-firmware packages - installed

2015-12-05 12:03:28	ezech	possibly it's just not powering on, there is a hardware switch but all it does is turn on/off bluetooth
2015-12-05 12:03:31	randomuser	ie iwl5000-firmware
2015-12-05 12:03:42	ezech	yeah, I think I have all of those

2015-12-05 12:06:15	ezech	what's the deal with the rfkill software though?
2015-12-05 12:06:30	ezech	wasn't it suppose to at least list devices it can see?

2015-12-05 12:06:59	ezech	I dunno, it just comes up quite often related to wifi problems on laptops :)
2015-12-05 12:07:00	randomuser	if it doesn't load the module for the device, you're not going to be able to work effectively with the device
2015-12-05 12:07:52	randomuser	ezech, as you try out different kernels, the output of ie `journalctl -kb|grep intel` or |grep iwl and such may be revealing

2015-12-05 16:18:00	jhogarth	morxa, no dependcy resolution (ie the transaction test) needs to pass
2015-12-05 16:18:07	jhogarth	what are you attempting to do ?
2015-12-05 16:19:42	morxa	After a failed F23 upgrade, I replayed a backup, but forgot to replay /var. So now dnf thinks it has F23 packages installed, but the system is a F22. So I figured to resolve the issue I would distro-sync, and then retry the upgrade
2015-12-05 16:20:02	morxa	But that fails because of file conflicts with the F22 packages installed
2015-12-05 16:22:26	morxa	I mean file conflicts with the files on the system, which dnf assumes not to be there
2015-12-05 16:23:29	jhogarth	well congratulations you borked your system impressively ... you can try to restore /var so things are consistent ... or you might get away with dnf reinstall \* to reinstall everything the rpm database says ... but your system is in such an inconsistent satte like that you could probbaly never trust it again (i mean what do you expect after partial restores of key system files on a filesystem?) so you'll probbably be better off backing up your data

2015-12-06 00:45:45	HarveyPwca	If you enable anti-aliasing, set the hinting to full and the sub-pixel order to rgb you should be getting quite adequate results. Even better on most laptop screens if you set the dpi to 96 the fonts will not look so large and "cartoonish".

2015-12-06 01:10:08	ovrflw0x	reading hurts, spoon feeding works

2015-12-06 04:50:38	Fjorgynn	but the problem you're having with fedora is grahpics right? Twirl ?
2015-12-06 04:51:07	Twirl	Fjorgynn: not really, everything works fine except in chrome
2015-12-06 04:51:14	Twirl	it's version 47.0.2526.73 (64-bit)
2015-12-06 04:51:15	Fjorgynn	;)
2015-12-06 04:51:39	Twirl	also, it's not graphics, animations etc work fine it's just the input
2015-12-06 04:51:44	Twirl	and some of it
2015-12-06 04:52:06	Twirl	if i grab the scroll bar it works perfectly
2015-12-06 04:52:20	Fjorgynn	yeah I gave up on chrome. But that was because of Google
2015-12-06 04:52:23	pranavk	So I figured out that after disabling my NVIDIA chip from BIOS, my fedora starts smoothly now. (I was not able to get upto GDM before. It would restart my PC automatically)
2015-12-06 04:52:25	Twirl	if i press the end button it takes 2 seconds to scroll to the bottom of the page, wtf?
2015-12-06 04:52:34	pranavk	Anyone else familiar of such a problem
2015-12-06 04:52:35	pranavk	?
2015-12-06 04:52:37	Twirl	Fjorgynn: well i never experienced this on ubuntu
2015-12-06 04:53:02	Twirl	pranavk: i had a similar issue before but because i was booting up with 2 external displays
2015-12-06 04:53:20	Fjorgynn	pranavk: it's the nvidia drivers?
2015-12-06 04:53:23	pranavk	I am not booting up with any external display.
2015-12-06 04:53:50	pranavk	Fjorgynn: I just installed NVIDIA drivers from their official website. So no, earlier I was using built-in nouveau
2015-12-06 04:54:11	Fjorgynn	yeah you probably shouldn't do that
2015-12-06 04:54:16	Fjorgynn	repos are better
2015-12-06 04:54:25	Fjorgynn	Twirl: that's not a setting in chrome right?
2015-12-06 04:54:29	pranavk	and I would see nouveau spam my splash start screen with: "SCHED_ERROR"
2015-12-06 04:54:54	Twirl	Fjorgynn: what?
2015-12-06 04:54:56	pranavk	Fjorgynn: you mean I shouldn't use nouveau, and try it with official NVIDIA drivers ?
2015-12-06 04:55:17	Twirl	Fjorgynn: im okay with using chrome 46 actually, it has 58.3% market share as of november 2015
2015-12-06 04:55:50	Xard	at least i noticed that the boot will halt to a kernel panic if nvidia drivers are installed and nouveau isn't black listed
2015-12-06 04:56:27	pranavk	yeah, I read the same. I will make sure to blacklist nouveau before rebooting
2015-12-06 04:56:56	Xard	and you still need to disable kernel modesetting
2015-12-06 04:58:05	pranavk	i have no idea what that is. /me googles
2015-12-06 04:59:00	Xard	here are the grub2 paramaters: "ro nouveau.modeset=0 rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau video=vesa:off"

2015-12-06 10:13:08	kk4ewt	nilekada,  so just an update

2015-12-06 12:07:48	tilpner	Disregarding any bugs, this looks like a safety guard against malicious plugins, that will request confirmation with a warning before actually running it.

2015-12-06 12:10:49	TheSuperGeek	ok
2015-12-06 12:10:55	tilpner	brolios - I believe this code is not meant to be run, and fedy will actually issue a warning if a plugin tries to do so.

2015-12-06 18:33:26	sdgathman	I guess for primarily incoming data, like big downloads, the QoS has to happen in the gateway router (running CentOS6).
2015-12-06 18:33:50	sinner-	yeah so basically whats happening is this: im running firefox from within firejail, which is suid (then drops CAP_ROOT). this means that programs spawned by firefox are also jailed. this works fine in ubuntu (in terms of the problem im having) but i guess here selinux is setting filelabels as root rather than my user?
2015-12-06 18:34:14	sinner-	if i run transmission-gtk independently and paste the magnet link to it, i.e. not spawned inside the jail, it works correctly.
2015-12-06 18:34:27	sinner-	a little strange though, since firefox can download files without any issue

2015-12-06 18:36:35	chder	I don't think it's selinux but if it is you should see audit messages in the journal related to the directly. I think it's more likely your home directory was remounted as a tmpfs for the jailed app.
2015-12-06 18:36:55	Khaytsus	sinner-: Stuff in that thing are downloaded to a temporary filesystem which goes away when the browser is closed.

2015-12-06 18:40:09	johnsz	what type of sandbox is firejail anyway? i just set up the selinux sandbox command with firefox just curious... saw the github page for firejail couldnt tell it was selinux as well or not
2015-12-06 18:40:20	sinner-	its basically a seccomp blacklist
2015-12-06 18:40:41	sinner-	so compromised firefox cannot access .ssh, .gnupg and ~/Documents, i installed it after that annoying PDF.js exploit
2015-12-06 18:41:10	johnsz	ah okay... i think ill like the selinux sandbox better then even if its a bit clunky at times it seems to work okay
2015-12-06 18:41:50	sinner-	theyre not really the same thing. selinux sandbox is for running ephemeral processes

2015-12-06 18:42:38	Khaytsus	Firefox in Docker is another way to do it ;)
2015-12-06 18:43:06	sinner-	docker is not a secure isolation mechanism, but all of the isolation features you could enable in docker are already handled in firejail
2015-12-06 18:43:17	johnsz	docker is a bit extreme... lol... might be hard to get that working correctly with youtube and crap
2015-12-06 18:43:24	sinner-	using docker+sVirt is probably the same as selinux sandbox
2015-12-06 18:43:41	johnsz	well svirt is selinux

2015-12-08 13:16:23	SpaceInvaders	ok so to get stdin you have to use a fork in bash?  like myvar = ($(< /dev/stdin))
2015-12-08 13:17:00	SpaceInvaders	or myvar = ($( cat - )) # or cat $@

2015-12-08 13:18:44	cmecca	i actually dont have network connectivity to the machine
2015-12-08 13:18:49	Kellin	also - it sound silly, but sometimes if just sshd doesn't work, I pass vnc and sshd to the system and the network "just works"

2015-12-08 13:19:00	iSage`work	it's because $@ is empty 'cat $@' does same thing as just 'cat', e.g. - reads stdin
2015-12-08 13:19:16	SpaceInvaders	AAHHHH thanks iSage!!! :)

2015-12-08 13:58:14	Kellin	put home on the two two 2TB disks - back up home and just build the array on the disks later, no re-install needed
2015-12-08 13:58:26	dlehman	either accept no raid (for now, at least) or wait til you have all the necessary parts
2015-12-08 13:58:34	cmecca	yea.
2015-12-08 13:58:35	galvao	How do I permanently disable baloo? I've edited the .kde/share/config/baloorc file, changed the Indexing-Enabled to false and the damn thing still shows up from time to time
2015-12-08 13:58:44	cmecca	anyway - thanks for all the help guys :)
2015-12-08 13:58:54	cmecca	appreciate it. (learned somethin new)
2015-12-08 13:58:59	Kellin	yeah no problem
