2015-03-04 09:45:25	phy1729	ok hopefully last question for a while, is there any reason that common commands like od, tr, and wc don't have completion scripts? Is it because they're too simple or noone has written one yet?
2015-03-04 09:46:51	osse	to me od is cryptic as hell.
2015-03-04 09:47:05	osse	but honestly I hadn't noticed they were missing :p
2015-03-04 09:47:11	phy1729	ok too simple was for wc
2015-03-04 09:47:30	phy1729	I've been thinking about making it a long term project to write a completion script for everything in OpenBSD base.
2015-03-04 09:48:05	osse	check here to see if someone has already done it: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/tree/master/src
2015-03-04 09:48:22	osse	I think that serves as a dumping ground for completion script not yet good enough
2015-03-04 09:48:51	llua	the simple commands don't always share the same options across OSes
2015-03-04 09:49:12	osse	we need a posix specification parser!
2015-03-04 09:49:16	phy1729	sure but plenty of commands have OSTYPE checks
2015-03-04 09:49:27	Valodim	most gnu tools can be completed with _gnu_generic

2015-03-04 10:12:08	dataangel	In my .zshrc I have two situations, either one of which or both may occur. In the first situation I want to use alias to map "X" to "wrapper X". In the second situation I want to map "X" to "X --arg". If both situations arise I want "X" to map to "wrapper X --arg". Can an alias wrap an existing alias for the same command? Basically wondering if it's possible to keep the two aliases separate yet get the command I want.

2015-03-04 10:13:39	dataangel	why does it matter?
2015-03-04 10:13:59	thrig	because the above makes little sense, so I asked for clarification
2015-03-04 10:14:22	dataangel	say I do
2015-03-04 10:14:30	dataangel	alias ssh="ssh -C"

2015-03-04 10:14:49	dataangel	but I want them to combine
2015-03-04 10:14:52	dataangel	so the command is really
2015-03-04 10:14:57	dataangel	ssh -C -X
2015-03-04 10:15:16	dataangel	by default the second alias will just blow away the first right?
2015-03-04 10:15:53	thrig	yup.
2015-03-04 10:17:01	dataangel	any way to make them combine instead?
2015-03-04 10:17:57	thrig	it would probably involve lots of code, shell parsing, and resulting bugs

2015-03-04 12:15:11	osse	oh? the next prompt appears after ten seconds, not zero
2015-03-04 12:15:25	mozzarella	osse: not talking about the next prompt
2015-03-04 12:15:29	osse	Or did I misunderstand
2015-03-04 12:15:32	mozzarella	I mean the CURRENT prompt
2015-03-04 12:15:45	mozzarella	zsh can still modify it until it's printed for good
2015-03-04 12:15:52	mozzarella	with \r and whatnot
2015-03-04 12:16:04	mozzarella	does it print it for good before running the program, or after?
2015-03-04 12:16:33	osse	Before
2015-03-04 12:16:44	mozzarella	because I've seen programs erasing my zsh prompt… not sure if it's a zsh issue or terminal issue
2015-03-04 12:17:16	mozzarella	technically, if the prompt is printed for good it shouldn't happen
2015-03-04 12:18:43	osse	Everything is printed for good, in that sense.  But things can be overwritten. Programs can position the cursor anywhere they want
2015-03-04 12:19:20	mozzarella	osse: I thought it was only possible in some special mode
2015-03-04 12:19:30	mozzarella	I don't know much about terminals
2015-03-04 12:20:02	CcxCZ	anything is possible :]
2015-03-04 12:20:32	CcxCZ	some zsh widget might want to redraw the prompt, eg. I use vi mode indication
2015-03-04 12:21:17	CcxCZ	also the output of background programs is uncoordinated with zsh, so they will write stuff in the middle of you typing
2015-03-04 12:22:00	mozzarella	I also get teh same issue on bash… except it's buggier
2015-03-04 12:22:17	osse	mozzarella: try this:  tput cup 3 10; echo hello
2015-03-04 12:23:46	osse	you can make it overwrite the prompt without trouble
2015-03-04 12:24:25	osse	zsh seems to clear the terminal below the next prompt. bash doesn't. that makes it look even more AWESOME
2015-03-04 12:25:39	mozzarella	what's happening?
2015-03-04 12:27:07	osse	you're telling the terminal to put the cursor at column 3, line 10
2015-03-04 12:28:21	mozzarella	do you mean the opposite?
2015-03-04 12:28:56	osse	yers

2015-03-04 13:05:57	CcxCZ	mozzarella: alternate screen is something that allows them to save the current screen state and restore it after exit. It also might mess up scrollback and yes there's only one afaik.
2015-03-04 13:06:21	CcxCZ	lot of people hate that with a passion and disable it
2015-03-04 13:07:13	thrig	... because you man foo, and look at useful info, then q the pager and then foip! the info is gone, and then you're cursing
2015-03-04 13:07:15	mozzarella	CcxCZ: so there's nothing special about it, other than the fact that there's no scrollback and that it's separate? you can do everything you can do inside the normal screen?

2015-03-04 13:09:59	CcxCZ	mainly it's about setting terminal to handle input itself by echoing characters you type and do stuff like backspace and it gets only sent on enter, so it's gets printed and is line-editable even if the application only ever does read()
2015-03-04 13:10:47	CcxCZ	that's the cooked mode, in the raw mode the everything is sent to the application directly without interpretation by terminal

2015-03-04 16:46:13	osse	it's only bad cuz ur old and grumpy
2015-03-04 16:46:58	blueyed	:D - I am not saying github is good, but just that's the current state of software development art.
2015-03-04 16:47:28	blueyed	I could setup a cron job to mirror the current Git to github.
2015-03-04 16:47:59	osse	this was updated 6 hours ago: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh
2015-03-04 16:48:05	osse	no idea by whom
2015-03-04 16:48:21	Mikachu	github pull requests are awful though, using github as a pure git mirror is fine
2015-03-04 16:48:23	blueyed	A few months ago this has been a great improvement to awesomeWM, and I think that it would be nicer to discuss PRs on Github than on the mailinglist.
2015-03-04 16:48:54	blueyed	Mikachu: but you could still cherry-pick/merge from a Github PR then..
2015-03-04 16:49:09	osse	and update that stupid ChangeLog
2015-03-04 16:50:38	Mikachu	the 'stupid changelog' is actually pretty useful (although putting the xseq in the commit message is just as fine)
2015-03-04 16:52:05	osse	not sure what it does that git log --oneline doesn't
2015-03-04 16:52:47	osse	except making git's "has this thing been applied upstream?" logic useless
2015-03-04 16:53:20	osse	hmm, or maybe it works because it's a different file.
2015-03-04 16:53:44	blueyed	https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh seems to be special.. it has a "mirrored from git://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code" line beneath it.
2015-03-04 16:53:54	blueyed	So we could use this probably.
2015-03-04 16:55:29	blueyed	How can I resolve vars in "whence -f gswitch", so that it replaces "$_git_cmd" in there?

2015-03-04 16:56:06	Mikachu	no idea what you mean
2015-03-04 16:58:04	blueyed	I am using a preexec hook to invalidate the vcs_info cache (or rather not cache anything), and my "gswitch" alias doesn't call "git" directly.
2015-03-04 16:58:47	blueyed	If $_git_cmd was resolved in the "whence -f" lookup, it would be matched (and vcs_info would regather the data)
2015-03-04 16:59:10	Mikachu	whence -f just prints the function definition
2015-03-04 16:59:20	Mikachu	it doesn't execute any code
2015-03-04 16:59:44	blueyed	yes. But I would like to resolve any vars, but no shell code, in there.
2015-03-04 16:59:55	Mikachu	that statement doesn't really make any sense
2015-03-04 17:00:05	Mikachu	what does ${$(ls)} mean then?
2015-03-04 17:00:23	Mikachu	${foo:-$(cmd)}
2015-03-04 17:00:32	blueyed	There's also "local cb=$(current_branch)" in the function, which shouldn't be executed.
2015-03-04 17:00:35	Mikachu	it would be a whole new parameter expansion codepath just to print functions
2015-03-04 17:00:46	Mikachu	which i still don't know why you want
2015-03-04 17:00:52	Mikachu	are you parsing the function body somehow?
2015-03-04 17:01:17	blueyed	Well, I am looking for a pattern in the function body, yes.
2015-03-04 17:02:16	blueyed	It's based on example from Misc/vcs_info-examples, but heavily expanded.

2015-03-04 17:22:35	mozzarella	why did bash become more popular than zsh?

2015-03-04 17:23:18	Mikachu	the fun part is that i wrote that command correctly in one try
2015-03-04 17:23:48	osse	and it was explicit that its original goal was to be the GNU implementation of sh

2015-03-04 17:24:26	osse	mozzarella: yes
2015-03-04 17:24:50	osse	ksh already existed before bash, and was/is pretty advanced.

2015-03-07 11:10:31	offbyone	Hey, all. Somewhere I remember that there's a ZSH expansion that expands to "the full path of an executable on PATH" or emtpy, but I can't recall the term to search for
2015-03-07 11:10:41	offbyone	Does someone here recall that?

2015-03-07 11:15:21	offbyone	so quick question here; if I wanted to do something like this:
2015-03-07 11:15:36	offbyone	if [[ ${=docker-machine} ]]; then something something; fi
2015-03-07 11:15:41	offbyone	that doesn't seem to quite do what I want.
2015-03-07 11:15:56	Faux	What do you want?
2015-03-07 11:15:58	Mikachu	why would you ever want to explicitly split in that context?
2015-03-07 11:16:21	Mikachu	it would still just be true if the parameter is set and false otherwise
2015-03-07 11:16:25	offbyone	if docker-machine is installed; use docker-machine to set up env; elif boot2docker is installed; then use boot2docker to set up env; elif docker is installed; use bare docker; else nothing
2015-03-07 11:16:27	Faux	If you want to check a command exists, you're supposed to use "hash".
2015-03-07 11:16:43	Mikachu	${=foo} and =foo are entirely different things
2015-03-07 11:16:47	Faux	> if hash ls 2>/dev/null; then echo have ls; fi
2015-03-07 11:16:48	SweetieBot	Faux: have ls
2015-03-07 11:17:23	Faux	(This is all kinds of POSIX levels of portable.)

2015-03-09 13:02:32	llua	i would suggest starting out with simpler commands. completers for commands that have 'subcommands' quickly become complex.

2015-03-11 21:04:07	d-rock	Without quotes you're getting back an array (word split). At least that's my understanding

2015-03-11 21:05:23	d-rock	NP. I've been trying to grok the (massive) expansion section of the manual
2015-03-11 21:05:26	Mikachu	the [] syntax is 'the zsh way', :: is just bash compatibility
2015-03-11 21:05:42	d-rock	Yeah, also point out there that [] is 1-based indices

2015-03-20 20:28:09	joe9	Hello, I have this code in my .zshrc file http://dpaste.com/2F5Y2NN , and it used to work fine until recently. Earlier, when I do not type anything and press 'k', it would show me the previous history command. Now, it seems to go into some kind of processing. I have to press Control-C to break out of the processing.
2015-03-20 20:28:38	joe9	If I type something and press 'k', it shows the previous history command that matched (expected behaviour)
2015-03-20 20:29:03	joe9	It is only when I press 'k' without typing anything that it goes into this unresponsive state.
2015-03-20 20:29:15	joe9	Just want to check if anyone has noticed this behaviour.

2015-03-21 00:50:18	Mikachu	.zshrc would be a good place for that
2015-03-21 00:50:31	tortib	do I just use the bindkey command like bash?
2015-03-21 00:50:50	Mikachu	i don't know what bash does
2015-03-21 00:51:00	tortib	well what does zsh use?

2015-03-21 01:03:42	tortib	I'm trying to have the home and end keys move to the beginning of the line and the end of the line.  I checked the zsh man page and it doesn't really specify anything about bindkey, I tried "bindkey '\e[1~': beginning-of-line" but it doesn't seem to work

2015-03-21 01:25:06	DarkFox	I highly recommend.... autoload zsh/terminfo; bindkey "$terminfo[khome]" beginning-of-line
2015-03-21 01:25:31	tortib	where do i put "autoload zsh/terminfo" in .zshrc?

2015-03-21 01:35:32	DarkFox	Looks like iTerm doesn't have a complete terminfo file for your terminal :(
2015-03-21 01:35:46	tortib	yep
2015-03-21 01:35:47	tortib	there now
2015-03-21 01:35:52	tortib	DarkFox: thanks!
2015-03-21 01:35:56	tortib	let me see if it works

2015-03-21 01:36:19	DarkFox	tortib: Keep in mind; you are lying about the capabilities about the terminal; it may or may not work... Some unexpected things may happen :)
2015-03-21 01:36:46	tortib	it works
2015-03-21 01:36:49	tortib	but is my life in danger?
2015-03-21 01:37:07	DarkFox	Just try all your key combinations and keys that you would actually use
2015-03-21 01:37:15	DarkFox	If nothing strange happens, then it should work.
2015-03-21 01:37:16	DarkFox	:)
2015-03-21 01:37:33	DarkFox	At worst; you press a key and it thinks you pressed another.
2015-03-21 01:37:54	tortib	everything appears to be operating as it should
2015-03-21 01:38:11	DarkFox	Awesome. Blame iTerm :)
2015-03-21 01:38:20	tortib	yeah, I thought that was the culprit
2015-03-21 01:38:23	tortib	thanks for your help DarkFox

2015-03-21 05:49:30	Faux	Are you running it directly, or with zsh -c or something?  That syntax is only valid in most cases.  You can always prefix "env" to meake it work, though.

2015-03-21 06:56:12	llua	it's a builtin command found in zshbuiltins
2015-03-21 06:57:04	joe9	llua: thanks
2015-03-21 06:59:00	Mikachu	if you read the pdf version of the manpage, there's a handy index at the end, and every time it says "this command is like typeset -f" you can click on 'typeset' to go to that part of the docs
2015-03-21 07:00:07	Mikachu	ah, i lied, the latter part is not so
2015-03-21 07:00:17	llua	you should try functions -t <func> so you can trace the other functions too.
2015-03-21 07:02:08	llua	or functions -T _func_it_stops_at
2015-03-21 07:02:17	joe9	+history-substring-search-up:1> _history-substring-search-begin
2015-03-21 07:02:24	joe9	I get the above line also with -t
2015-03-21 07:02:46	joe9	I think there has been a change to the functionality of history substring search
2015-03-21 07:04:28	Mikachu	we can't support omz code here, just point you in the direction of where to look to fix it
2015-03-21 07:04:44	joe9	Mikachu: sure, I understand.
2015-03-21 07:04:48	Mikachu	or whatever that is
2015-03-21 07:04:52	joe9	Thanks, for the guidance.
2015-03-21 07:05:31	joe9	llua: the -t helped.
2015-03-21 07:05:46	joe9	I can see that it searches through all the history commands when the line is blank
2015-03-21 07:06:01	joe9	I have a large history and that is why it is taking a while

2015-03-21 07:15:47	machabot	Corey84: "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains.
2015-03-21 07:16:28	Corey84	llua,  why the heavy discouragement
2015-03-21 07:17:13	llua	it is the top reason people ask why zsh does something weird or is broken.

2015-03-21 08:32:46	joe9	There seem to be quite a few that provide similar functionality

2015-03-21 11:21:04	blueyed	I've started with omz myself, but it's full of oddities and badly maintained, but still popular.
2015-03-21 11:23:39	blueyed	I've noticed that when using "git diff -p --stat", it only completes files (`changed in working tree file'). Can somebody confirm it?
2015-03-21 11:26:53	blueyed	It's because the completion considers them both as diff-types, which are handled exclusive. I'll post to the mailinglist about it.

2015-04-09 08:48:16	vaskozl	So sorry I diconnect before. I have the same question.
2015-04-09 08:48:32	vaskozl	I want to grep trough the output of a running command and then execute a command when there is a match.
2015-04-09 08:50:15	llua	grep -q foo file && magic
2015-04-09 08:50:47	vaskozl	but that quits
2015-04-09 08:50:52	vaskozl	I don't want it to quit
2015-04-09 08:50:55	vaskozl	kinda like:
2015-04-09 08:51:00	vaskozl	while true; do echo 'match me';sleep 1;done | while read line;do echo 'my command is executed';done
2015-04-09 08:51:08	vaskozl	^ that works but as soon as I add the grep:
2015-04-09 08:51:11	vaskozl	while true; do echo 'match me';sleep 1;done | grep 'me' | while read line;do echo 'my command is executed';done

2015-04-09 08:51:34	vaskozl	which I don't get since grep prints it just fine without the  last pipe

2015-04-10 16:28:21	Mikachu	moviuro: if your function already handles -h to print help, just call itself recursively with -h (for example)

2015-04-10 16:30:35	Mikachu	it will override any other usage function
2015-04-10 16:30:37	moviuro	I'll do that
2015-04-10 16:31:14	Mikachu	sure, printing a bunch of text in the middle of your keyhandler is ugly, but lots of things in shell are ugly :)
2015-04-10 16:31:20	Mikachu	i mean option handler
2015-04-10 16:31:45	Mikachu	arguably bk is already a very collidey name so i guess they might as well go for usage too ;)
2015-04-10 16:33:26	moviuro	Mikachu: yeah, I'll add a check for bk, in case it already exists somewhere

2015-04-12 04:20:55	moviuro	Hi everyone! I don't understand this syntax: o=${grep_options:+"${grep_options[*]}"}
2015-04-12 04:21:32	moviuro	> typeset -ga grep_options; grep_options+=( --color=auto ); echo ${grep_options:+"${grep_options[*]}"}

2015-04-12 04:21:54	moviuro	> typeset -ga grep_options; grep_options+=( --color=auto ); grep_options+=( -q ); echo ${grep_options:+"${grep_options[*]}"}
2015-04-12 04:21:54	SweetieBot	moviuro: --color=auto -q
2015-04-12 04:23:07	osse	moviuro: foo=${bar:+baz} is the same as  if [[ -n $bar ]]; then foo=baz; fi
2015-04-12 04:23:53	moviuro	ok osse, thanks
2015-04-12 04:23:56	osse	moviuro: so o is set to $grep_options[*] if $grep_options is non-empty
2015-04-12 04:24:44	osse	moviuro: my guess is o needs to be a string but $grep_options is an array.
2015-04-12 04:24:49	moviuro	would alias grep="command grep $o" be a huge mistake if o was empty/not set?
2015-04-12 04:25:28	moviuro	or even > alias grep="command grep $o[*] "
2015-04-12 04:25:56	moviuro	> alias grep="command grep $o[*] "; grep "a" <<< "a"

2015-04-16 18:22:30	blueyed	pipeep: yes, the initial implementation / idea is not from me, but I've made it skip git aliases, where you sometimes want to use "..." and it got annoying to do "..^V.".
2015-04-16 18:22:35	pipeep	Goopyo, you can modify PATH at any time. I don't really know what you're asking
2015-04-16 18:23:42	Goopyo	in python I want to exec('bin/bash') have the subshell have the parent's path without getting overwritten by zsh

2015-04-16 18:25:08	pipeep	Although I'm not 100% sure that actually clears the old environment variable
2015-04-16 18:25:17	Goopyo	wait I don't want to clear them
2015-04-16 18:25:22	pipeep	But you could do PATH= /bin/bash -l

2015-04-16 18:25:42	Goopyo	and is this common accross all shells like zsh?
2015-04-16 18:26:43	pipeep	Good news: it looks like -l clears the PATH
2015-04-16 18:26:48	pipeep	Goopyo, yes
2015-04-16 18:26:51	pipeep	zsh -l
2015-04-16 18:27:15	Goopyo	so PATH=blah $SHELL -l?
2015-04-16 18:27:36	pipeep	Actually it looks like just $SHELL -l
2015-04-16 18:27:45	pipeep	unless you want to add things to the path...
2015-04-16 18:28:41	pipeep	In which case you should probably do that inside whatever script you're executing with bash/zsh/sh/etc, after /etc/profile and ~/.profile are sourced
2015-04-16 18:29:32	Goopyo	yeah it looks like .profile is wrecking my path
2015-04-16 18:29:47	pipeep	If .profile is wrecking your path then -l won't help
2015-04-16 18:29:57	Goopyo	anything else that would work?
2015-04-16 18:30:11	Goopyo	because I don't think I can run another command due to the nature of exec
2015-04-16 18:30:34	pipeep	If you want to revert back to the system-wide path, just do `PATH=`, followed by `. /etc/profile`

2015-04-16 18:32:06	Goopyo	but that wouldn't give you an interactive shell would it?
2015-04-16 18:32:16	pipeep	Goopyo, I don't think you can revert to the parent's PATH easily because that state has been wiped.
2015-04-16 18:32:29	Goopyo	ooooo
2015-04-16 18:32:44	Goopyo	hacky but what if I use my parent process to write some dynamic myscript.sh
2015-04-16 18:32:45	pipeep	Goopyo, I think I need some more information as to what exactly you're trying to do.
2015-04-16 18:32:58	Goopyo	and then exec that script
2015-04-16 18:33:06	Goopyo	do you know of python virtualenvs?
2015-04-16 18:33:17	pipeep	And you want an interactive shell after myscript.sh?

2015-04-16 18:38:21	pipeep	Goopyo, some thoughts: (1) you can pass environment variables to an exec'ed process, (2) you can store what the PATH was previously, and restore that yourself
2015-04-16 18:39:06	Goopyo	is there a way to do (1) without being overridden by the rc/profile?
2015-04-16 18:39:47	pipeep	Okay. I think I see your problem now.
2015-04-16 18:40:19	Goopyo	yeah activate_env() updates path, exec('bin/zsh') clobbers it with whatever path is set in the rc/.profile
2015-04-16 18:42:12	pipeep	One idea: you could pass a custom rc file via --rcfile that runs the default one, and then afterwards fixes the PATH
2015-04-16 18:43:32	Goopyo	hmmm
2015-04-16 18:43:49	Goopyo	like gen some rc file then use that?
2015-04-16 18:44:02	pipeep	yeah. Messy as f*ck though
2015-04-16 18:44:23	Goopyo	lol well I do have a .inenv/ already there so putting jenky files is not a big issue
2015-04-16 18:44:39	Goopyo	is the interface for zsh and bash to do this similar?
2015-04-16 18:45:13	Goopyo	so you're saying the rc file would be like "source main rc, PATH="newpath:$PATH"
2015-04-16 18:46:00	pipeep	Goopyo, unfortunately it looks like only bash accepts --rcfile
2015-04-16 18:46:27	Goopyo	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2727172/how-to-load-different-zshrc-file-via-commandline-option --rcs?

2015-04-16 18:47:04	pipeep	Goopyo, yeah, --rcs looks good
2015-04-16 18:47:43	pipeep	You could also clobber HOME to do it, but then you have to worry about .profile.
2015-04-16 18:48:08	Goopyo	this makes me feel so dirty but I can't wait to try it tmrw
2015-04-16 18:48:20	llua	heh

2015-04-16 21:38:28	lasers	It seems to be happening (on current terminal) when I started a new terminal.
2015-04-16 21:40:56	Mikachu	¯\/(ツ)\/¯
2015-04-16 21:41:08	lasers	Commenting things out... Hopefully I can pinpoint it down to somewhere.
2015-04-16 21:41:29	Mikachu	must be something pretty weird if it affects your interactive prompt state
2015-04-16 21:41:35	Mikachu	what happens if you just press enter?
2015-04-16 21:41:37	lasers	୧༼ ͡◉ل͜ ͡◉༽୨
2015-04-16 21:42:03	Mikachu	assuming it prints the same prompt; what happens if you enter a single } and then press enter
2015-04-16 21:42:09	lasers	I get a new prompt. Looks okay.
2015-04-16 21:42:28	lasers	zsh: parse error near `}'
2015-04-16 21:42:30	Mikachu	that's even stranger, maybe it's just garbage printed by something in the background
2015-04-16 21:42:52	Mikachu	on the bright side i found another $( bug for pws to fix

2015-04-18 04:55:03	littlebit	hi poeple, I have zsh installed on my xubuntu machine along with zsh and a solarized theme. I have a little gui problem that I'm trying to figure out if it comes from zsh or not. When I call up vim, I have bottom line transparent. does that come from vim or zsh?
2015-04-18 04:56:33	osse	littlebit: start vim from bash and see
2015-04-18 04:57:10	littlebit	and another thing, how do I turn on the 256-colorized support at zsh
2015-04-18 04:57:14	littlebit	ok one sec
2015-04-18 04:57:46	littlebit	osse: it is also visible @ bash
2015-04-18 04:57:53	osse	if TERM = *-256color you don't have to turn on anything.
2015-04-18 04:58:05	osse	then it's likely a vim problem

2015-04-22 06:58:33	obelix666	hi. i created the following alias to open files with libreoffice calc and suppress the output

2015-04-22 06:59:09	obelix666	now when i type lo <tab> it tries to complete as a command rather than a file. how can i fix this?
2015-04-22 06:59:10	obelix666	tia
2015-04-22 06:59:12	Mikachu	your statement is false
2015-04-22 06:59:34	Mikachu	firstly your alias does not suppress any output, and secondly it will never open any files
2015-04-22 06:59:59	Mikachu	and it runs libreoffice in the background which you didn't state
2015-04-22 07:00:00	obelix666	sorry not suppress output just background the process
2015-04-22 07:00:10	Mikachu	okay
2015-04-22 07:00:27	thrig	use a function?
2015-04-22 07:00:30	Mikachu	alias lo='() { libreoffice --calc $1 & }' should work
2015-04-22 07:00:43	Mikachu	or more traditionally
2015-04-22 07:00:48	Mikachu	lo() { libreoffice --calc $1 & }
2015-04-22 07:00:54	thrig	hey! a function!
2015-04-22 07:01:17	osse	incredibru!!!
2015-04-22 07:03:01	obelix666	ok that's still trying to autocomplete a function after lo <tab>
2015-04-22 07:03:40	obelix666	(i've tried "alias lo='() { libreoffice --calc $1 & }'"
2015-04-22 07:04:55	Mikachu	you should make sure your original alias is not active
2015-04-22 07:08:15	obelix666	hmm so i have run a new shell and now when i check with alias lo i get lo='() { libreoffice --calc $1 & }' but it still doesn't work

2015-04-22 12:26:54	Alumin	(trying again today since I didn't have much luck yesterday and couldn't get any further on my own :P)  Is it possible to have alternative options in a completion function?  I'm getting weird output:  http://www.fpaste.org/214104/
2015-04-22 12:28:10	skylite	whats the difference between find . and find * ?
2015-04-22 12:28:51	Alumin	skylite: the first argument to the find command is the directory in which it operates
2015-04-22 12:29:07	Alumin	"*" would expand to all the files in the directory, which is probably a syntax error
2015-04-22 12:30:03	skylite	and . would mean all files in the directory and the directory itself?
2015-04-22 12:30:10	Alumin	theoretically you could use a glob pattern in that spot, I suppose, as long as you knew it was only going to evaluate to a single filename
2015-04-22 12:30:33	Alumin	using "." there means "the root of the find operation is the current directory"
2015-04-22 12:31:00	Alumin	as opposed to, say, "find /tmp -user root" which means to find files owned by root, under/including /tmp

2015-04-23 01:31:59	themba	Hi folks,
2015-04-23 01:32:37	themba	I was wondering something: would it be possible to embed zle in dmenu?
2015-04-23 01:32:52	themba	that would result in a very awesome launcher application
2015-04-23 01:33:03	themba	do you have any thoughts on that?
2015-04-23 01:33:08	themba	would it be hard?
2015-04-23 01:33:08	Mikachu	it would be easier to summon cthulhu and have him do your dishes
2015-04-23 01:33:33	themba	okay ;) thanks for your opinion
2015-04-23 01:33:54	<════	excelsior (~vijay@1.23.37.86) has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2015-04-23 01:34:05	themba	Mikachu: could you explain why you think it would be so hard?
2015-04-23 01:34:09	bremner	the first part is eas *HOST DISCONNECTED*
2015-04-23 01:34:36	Mikachu	zle is very interconnected with everything else in zsh
2015-04-23 01:35:11	themba	okay, I get that
2015-04-23 01:35:25	osse	since dmenu is an X application I think it would even be hard to make it use something like readline
2015-04-23 01:35:37	osse	or is "stdin" a thing even in the X world?
2015-04-23 01:35:46	Mikachu	for example, here is a global variable in the zle module
2015-04-23 01:35:46	Mikachu	mod_export int incompctlfunc;
2015-04-23 01:35:54	Mikachu	/* != 0 if in a shell function called from completion, such that read -[cl] will work (i.e., the line is metafied, and the above word arrays are OK). */
2015-04-23 01:36:10	themba	okay, so let's forget dmenu for a minute
2015-04-23 01:36:12	osse	themba: dmenu has a bunch of editing shortcuts actually. I learned that just now :p
2015-04-23 01:37:02	themba	osse: but it's way less cool than zsh:)
2015-04-23 01:37:15	osse	Mikachu: loose coupling and high cohesion is something only M$-like proprietary business douchebags care about.
2015-04-23 01:37:35	themba	could we trick <terminal emulator of your choice> into running one command in the background and then quit?
2015-04-23 01:38:15	Mikachu	if you mean make a launcher from xterm+zsh, then that's quite easy
2015-04-23 01:38:32	themba	Mikachu: something like that yes
2015-04-23 01:38:48	themba	how would you go about that?
2015-04-23 01:40:15	themba	to close after running one command you could put an exit statement in the code that generates the prompt conditioned on a variable that you set after the check >:)
2015-04-23 01:40:31	themba	the first time it runs you see the prompt
2015-04-23 01:40:39	Mikachu	i check if $ZSHRUN is set in my .zshrc and then do things slightly differently
2015-04-23 01:40:40	themba	the second time you reach the prompt it exits
2015-04-23 01:41:00	Mikachu	http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/cbb77753121680b6664493e248ada236.txt
2015-04-23 01:41:04	osse	xterm -e zsh -c 'blabla'
2015-04-23 01:41:06	Mikachu	i guess that's the tricky part
2015-04-23 01:41:20	Mikachu	you also want to unset ZSHRUN at some point before this happens obviously, but that's somewhere else

2015-04-23 07:26:29	Mikachu	make sure it's unset before you start zsh

2015-04-23 07:31:15	Mikachu	if you only set it inside a function, you can declare it as local -h FPATH, and setting it won't interfere with zsh's function path
2015-04-23 07:31:23	Mikachu	but you cannot do this for the main shell session, only inside functions
2015-04-23 07:31:34	Mikachu	is this for the fortran compiler?

2015-04-23 07:35:43	Mikachu	if it claims to support zsh and this fortran compiler, it is certainly the correct place to work around the problem
2015-04-23 07:36:51	Mikachu	there's a debian bug about it, but i don't think it has anything helpful http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=666168

2015-04-23 07:40:23	Mikachu	for example, you could have this module set FPATH_blah to the necessary value
2015-04-23 07:40:37	Mikachu	and define a function / wrapper script that copies FPATH_blah to FPATH when it is run
2015-04-23 07:41:57	Mikachu	ksh has used FPATH for this since at least before 1993
2015-04-23 07:42:00	hr0m	Yes, that's what i look for. However i don't know if I have rights to do so. The admins will not do it for sure :)

2015-04-23 07:42:55	Mikachu	you can also do all the wrapping i mentioned yourself, without the cooperation of an admin
2015-04-23 07:44:22	hr0m	Hmmm, or I use another shell.
2015-04-23 07:45:15	Mikachu	yeah
2015-04-23 07:45:30	hr0m	There is more funny behavior on that system, since it has zsh 4.3.10 and i am used to 5.0 at least

2015-05-03 11:20:47	baumy	having a large history file (currently ~1.2MB) is greatly slowing down my zsh startup. shell prompt takes about 1.5 seconds to appear, it's almost instantaneous without the large history file. is there a way around this while still maintaining a long history? e.g. lazy loading the file somehow?

2015-05-03 15:53:23	ThiefMaster	"This  option  is only useful if INC_APPEND_HISTORY and SHARE_HISTORY are turned off.  The three options should be considered mutually exclusive." - meh. i guess i'd rather lose stored execution times than shared history between shells
2015-05-03 15:54:01	Mikachu	i'm honestly not sure why share_history changes it back to before the command runs
2015-05-03 15:55:01	Mikachu	but i don't use extendedhistory so i don't care that much

2015-06-01 21:51:25	wilder_	is there some clever zsh trick to set some variable to the string obtained by repeating a given substring for n times?
2015-06-01 21:52:34	wilder_	there is some hack-ish way to do it in bash here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5349718/how-can-i-repeat-a-character-in-bash but I am looking for a cleaner trick
2015-06-01 21:52:46	variable	wilder_: you mean "a" * 3 in python?
2015-06-01 21:53:08	wilder_	variable: precisely
2015-06-01 21:53:39	variable	wilder_: repeat 4 printf '4'
2015-06-01 21:53:42	variable	maybe?
2015-06-01 21:53:50	variable	not the most efficient, but it works

2015-06-01 21:54:59	wilder_	variable: that works beautifully, thanks
2015-06-01 21:55:23	variable	wilder_: note that your'e actually repeating running the command multiple times
2015-06-01 21:55:54	wilder_	I can live with that, I think.

2015-06-01 21:57:09	variable	wilder_: that might be inefficient inside a prompt
2015-06-01 21:57:14	variable	is it run once, or every time?

2015-06-08 00:51:16	sash_	Hi. I use zsh for a while and moved from oh-my-zsh to grml zsh a few days ago. I am looking for a way to autocomplete rails commands like rails generate controller etc without mapping them to custom aliases . Do you know of any way to achieve this? All I find using google is oh-my-zsh stuff.

2015-06-08 02:38:54	impaktor	I've been experiencing for a long time, a problem when ssh to a computer with zsh, where sometimes the terminal hangs, and I can't do anything on the remote computer until I have physical access to it and can remove my .zshrc file.
2015-06-08 02:39:05	impaktor	Today, I think I've narrowed down the issue.
2015-06-08 02:39:18	impaktor	I have in my .zshrc: HISTFILE=~/.histfile
2015-06-08 02:39:32	impaktor	and doing ls -l .histfile* I get:

2015-06-08 02:40:06	impaktor	Not sure what it means, but something is locking my hist file? Making any new zsh connection impossible?
2015-06-08 02:40:39	impaktor	I should maybe mention I also have setopt appendhistory in my ~/.zshrc
2015-06-08 02:40:48	csed	How do I stop this ridiculous scp auto-complete. It Doesn't Work.

2015-06-11 18:38:17	haasn	There's something that annoys me about zsh compared to bash. I have a few commands aliased, but sometimes I don't want to use my alias but want to run the command directly. In bash, I just did $(which <command>) <parameters> to run it without using my alias, but in zsh, ‘which’ expands to “command: aliased to <alias>”, rather than the path of the command itself

2015-06-11 18:39:51	llua	that is a pretty round about way of doing \aliasnamehere in either shell
2015-06-11 18:40:03	llua	or =cmd in zsh
2015-06-11 18:40:23	Phreakachu	haasn: you can't be guaranteed that the command you are executing is exactly what you want unless you know the absolute path

2015-06-11 18:43:43	llua	it is broken anyway because wordsplitting and globbing happens after the $(). it is pretty stupid.

2015-06-11 18:44:26	haasn	In fact, using /path/tool would not be a correct solution to my problem - because as I stated in my problem, I just wanted to run ‘tool’ without the alias. That is, as if I had commented out the alias, reloaded zshrc, and typed ‘tool’. If PATH makes that ‘tool’ be something different than /path/tool, then I would suddenly be running different versions of ‘tool’

2015-06-15 18:42:13	joe9	Will it overwrite the default zshaddhistory?
2015-06-15 18:43:08	Mikachu	there is no default zshaddhistory
2015-06-15 18:44:19	joe9	instead of using the function name zshaddhistory there, would it be recommended to use a different function name and use add-zsh-hook?

2015-06-17 11:57:57	ComradeP	That's fair.
2015-06-17 11:58:24	ComradeP	But other expansion modifiers require braces -- ${a:c} is clearly intended as a modified expansion, and $a:c, to my eye, clearly isn't
2015-06-17 11:58:45	ComradeP	[the actual context of this was with something like `CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:classes.jar`]
2015-06-17 11:59:02	Mikachu	well, you can spell it ${a}:c if you want
2015-06-17 11:59:16	ComradeP	Sure, inserting braces disambiguates it.
2015-06-17 11:59:28	Mikachu	it's already disambiguated, it just doesn't mean what you want ;)

2015-06-28 22:35:02	danielsh__	foldingcookie, maybe it gets parsed as '4<<e cho foo' somehow?
2015-06-28 22:36:06	foldingcookie	it "moves over" a bit if you add more spaces, like `alias -g '$'='4  <<('`
2015-06-28 22:37:07	foldingcookie	add enough and you get zsh: unterminated `<(...)'

2015-07-02 15:01:59	ito	Alissa: in the first line of the terminal
2015-07-02 15:02:07	Alissa	Alright, let me try to draft something up
2015-07-02 15:02:46	Mikachu	would be a bit inconvenient to always scroll up to see what the last output was
2015-07-02 15:03:28	ito	Mikachu: i meant in a way that the output is below the prompt
2015-07-02 15:04:17	Alissa	I think, after the command, you can probably just move the prompt back to the top line and for each line of the prompt write a "\e[1;1H\e[K"
2015-07-02 15:04:18	Mikachu	xrandr --reflect y
2015-07-02 15:04:35	Mikachu	or hack your terminal to reverse lines
2015-07-02 15:04:49	Alissa	hm. never mind then.
2015-07-02 15:04:51	Mikachu	will probably break most interactive programs though

2015-07-02 15:06:24	Mikachu	say your terminal is 10 lines high, you run ls and it outputs 20 lines

2015-07-04 17:34:53	trout	when I have sh/ and shells/ and I type sh<tab> how do I get zsh to show a menu just as if I've typed s<tab> ?
2015-07-04 17:36:00	Mikachu	the question is, how did you get it to not do that?
2015-07-04 17:36:18	trout	good question
2015-07-04 17:36:27	trout	I am not enirely certain
2015-07-04 17:36:47	trout	https://github.com/unixdotfiles/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/zsh.complete.zsh -> this is the relevent config

2015-07-04 17:41:37	trout	hrm?
2015-07-04 17:41:46	Mikachu	for me, setting recexact gives the behaviour you describe

2015-07-04 17:42:08	trout	I just did unsetopt rec_exact

2015-07-04 17:43:59	Mikachu	that sounds weird
2015-07-04 17:44:30	trout	I'll try without a config and try bisecting
2015-07-04 17:44:46	trout	but need to do some rejiggering due to some weird machines I suddenly need to ssh to
2015-07-04 17:45:43	Mikachu	i use setopt nocompleteinword globcomplete nolistambiguous listpacked
2015-07-04 17:45:47	Mikachu	zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' `: +'r:|[._-]=* r:|=*'` +'l:|=* r:|=*'

2015-07-04 17:47:46	trout	clears the 'files' 'directories', etc. groups?
2015-07-04 17:48:00	Mikachu	shows a little header and separates all the completions into separate groups

2015-07-06 16:38:31	ntnn_	Yeah, and I'm on of them I don't see much use for more colours. When I want to work I don't want my code to be a masterpiece of modern 'art', I want it to be useful. Deciding on the shade of blue is my last problem in that matter

2015-07-26 17:12:21	hapislacker	I am using prezto zsh and was wondering how to show a python virtualenv ? it used to show (env)$ prompt but not anymore
2015-07-26 17:16:49	danielsh	what did you change? and how can you tell whether you're in a virtualenv (is there an environment variable that gets set)?
2015-07-26 17:18:30	--	licensed_ is now known as licensed
2015-07-26 17:19:57	hapislacker	danielsh: sometime ago I had the prompt changed when I start a virtual env like (my_env)$ but know I have the normal prompt
2015-07-26 17:20:59	hapislacker	danielsh: as am using preztosh I tried to add in the theme functions (agnoster) the one I am using but nothing happened
2015-07-26 17:21:52	danielsh	hapislacker, I no nothing about prezto specifically, only about zsh generically.
2015-07-26 17:22:29	danielsh	what did you change between when it worked and when it didn't work? how can zsh tell whether a venv is active?
2015-07-26 17:25:51	hapislacker	danielsh: am looking this https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/python

2015-07-31 12:48:02	JasonWoof	I've implemented a run-dialog with zsh (I bind the enter key, which tries to save the input to the history, then add stuff to the input before executing it (so it runs in the background) then close the terminal)

2015-07-31 12:48:41	JasonWoof	gets into the history as "foo bar baz"... how do I get the backslash into the history too?
2015-07-31 12:49:27	JasonWoof	I've got the input as $@ in my function
2015-07-31 12:50:17	danielsh	add -r
2015-07-31 12:50:23	JasonWoof	my function is run by:  bindkey -s "^M" "^A run_dialog_enter \n"
2015-07-31 12:50:53	JasonWoof	danielsh: I tried that
2015-07-31 12:51:22	danielsh	x='foo\ bar baz'; print -rs - $x
2015-07-31 12:51:24	JasonWoof	danielsh: there's no \ anymore by the time print() runs
2015-07-31 12:51:24	danielsh	DTRTs for me
2015-07-31 12:51:46	danielsh	if you tried the command you wrote, then the initial split into words ate the \, unrelated the print's -r flag

2015-07-31 12:52:28	JasonWoof	right now, I'm binding ENTER key, which gives me the input line as $@
2015-07-31 12:52:37	JasonWoof	no backslashes in $@, but it is split in the correct place
2015-07-31 12:52:56	JasonWoof	is there some way I can get access to the text on the commandline (as a string, with the \ still there?)
2015-07-31 12:53:14	danielsh	err, I just see what you're' doing
2015-07-31 12:53:16	JasonWoof	$@ is parsed already, which is not the correct format for the history file
2015-07-31 12:53:23	danielsh	that bindkey looks like an odd way to go about it
2015-07-31 12:53:28	danielsh	did you consider preexec/precmd ?
2015-07-31 12:54:14	danielsh	or you can do a proper widget (bindkey without -s), that'll handle 'foo; bar\n' and such too

2015-07-31 13:00:16	JasonWoof	does zsh write to history before or after preexec? (or not at all if prexec runs?)
2015-07-31 13:01:08	danielsh	no idea
2015-07-31 13:05:12	JasonWoof	hmmm... doesn't seem to be any (obvious) way to alter what's going to be executed with preexec

2015-07-31 18:16:36	haasn	ah, I already semi-answered my own question: Just store the role as an extra variable and use normal variable checks

2015-08-01 04:47:09	rivarun	ooh. there's also the N quantifier to check if the path i'm adding exists
2015-08-01 04:47:30	osse	The check makes sure that you don't do an array unnecessary assignment. On the other hand maybe that check is expensive, and the typeset -U is handled internally in the depths of C. Which is best? I have no clue.

2015-08-01 05:01:42	rivarun	here's the thing; i use my window manager to spawn applications. if i have a new application in a new path of the PATH, i would have to restart the WM to have it read the new PATH. not that this is something that often happens, but that's how i ended up moving stuff over to .zshenv
2015-08-01 05:02:50	rivarun	of course i could have a function in the WM itself that loads ~/.zprofile before every invocation of any application, but that sounds like a bit of a pain
2015-08-01 05:03:21	osse	rivarun: btw, if your .zshenv takes a long time then that might explain some of that Vim slowness

2015-08-02 08:34:56	danielsh_	I think you want :mess, but see what thrig said
2015-08-02 08:35:11	danielsh_	(:mess is a vim command)
2015-08-02 08:35:32	thrig	"hi, #vim, my startup emits messages, how do I deal with those?"
2015-08-02 08:36:41	turtleding	thrig: my question has essentially nothing to do with vim itself^^
2015-08-02 08:36:55	thrig	XY problem
2015-08-02 08:37:44	turtleding	the point is. i don't want to post that error report on a pastebin, rather delete sensitive things..
2015-08-02 08:38:15	turtleding	well they're not really sensitve, but i still would like to know how to deal with that^^
2015-08-02 08:39:16	danielsh_	turtleding, if vim starts successfully, you should be asking on #vim.

2015-08-02 08:41:38	danielsh_	(and if :mess didn't give you what you needed, you have some script which isn't using :echomsg like it should...)
2015-08-02 08:46:25	turtleding	danielsh_: im not asking about vim, im asking about processing sterr with sed. therefore it doesnt make sense to ask on #vim. (but for solving the vim error, i will as of course on #vim)

2015-08-22 09:59:04	Earnestly	I'm a bit lost dealing with missing command-line completion from systemd's zsh completion scripts.  It definately has 'cat' sub-command and works for others, but even with `zsh -f` using just autoload -U compinit && compinit, I don't get 'cat' when using `systemctl c<tab>`.  What can I look for to try and explain this?
2015-08-22 09:59:11	Earnestly	So far ruled out any custom fpath locations

2015-08-22 10:02:33	machabot	Earnestly: _complete_debug(bound to: "^X?") is an widget used to enable xtrace during a call of the completion system. this trace is useful for seeing problems in your completion function. The trace is normally saved in /tmp.
2015-08-22 10:02:56	danielsh	zsh ships a completion in a file called _systemd not _systemctl

2015-08-22 10:05:15	Earnestly	Yeah
2015-08-22 10:05:28	danielsh	*sigh* one or the other should be dropped entirely
2015-08-22 10:05:32	danielsh	no reason to maintain it in two places
2015-08-22 10:05:55	Earnestly	It makes sense for projects to provide completion rather than zsh doing it
2015-08-22 10:06:07	llua	there was a ml post about removing it, i assumed it happened.
2015-08-22 10:06:17	danielsh	there are arguments both ways Earnestly

2015-08-22 10:07:06	Earnestly	Either way, it works except for one or two commands, and that's weird
2015-08-22 10:07:17	Earnestly	e.g. the subcommand cat or edit don't show up but they're definately there

2015-08-22 10:07:39	Earnestly	Not sure how to use _complete_debug but I can try with set +x
2015-08-22 10:07:44	danielsh	Earnestly, the completion functions depend on both upstream changes and zshcompsys(1) changes. I'm not sure either place is Right.
2015-08-22 10:07:46	Earnestly	(erm -x)
2015-08-22 10:07:58	Earnestly	danielsh: Others on 5.0.8 have success

2015-08-22 13:09:18	LadyAlissa	Earnestly: I wouldn't double fork but this increases my boot time by about 5 seconds and I would rather have it moved elsewhere and shoved into background

2015-10-02 20:01:31	hagabaka	I'm using zprezto's history-substring-search plugin, and it stopped working recently (now up just goes through history like normal). Does anyone have ideas how to fix it, or how I can find out the problem?
2015-10-02 20:03:47	llua	setopt xtrace

2015-10-02 20:10:06	hagabaka	I read that xtrace doesn't work for code executed on key press, or it could be the function isn't actually run...
2015-10-02 20:13:33	llua	the latter
2015-10-02 20:13:43	llua	or something else
2015-10-02 20:13:53	hagabaka	if I call the function history-substring-search-up directly, it prints "widgets can only be called when ZLE is active". Any way to work around that?
2015-10-02 20:14:20	llua	it is working as intended, you don't run widgets that way
2015-10-02 20:15:11	hagabaka	I thought so too, but I thought it might help to see what the function output was
2015-10-02 20:17:15	llua	what does bindkey 'key_that_you_think_is_bound_to_h-s-s-u' print?

2015-10-02 21:21:42	joobus	hey! getting closer.  the compinit part worked, now my script just needs tweaking
2015-10-02 21:24:54	joobus	is there a way to reload the script without starting a new shell?
2015-10-02 21:25:05	joobus	i think my result is getting cached

2015-10-02 21:26:38	joobus	do you guys recommend going through that zsh-newuser-setup or whatever it's called?
2015-10-02 21:28:04	Mikachu	it should be better than starting with an empty .zshrc, sure
2015-10-02 21:30:24	joobus	thanks for your help guys.  I got my completion script working :)
2015-10-02 21:31:20	Mikachu	you don't need the wrapping thing btw
2015-10-02 21:31:25	Mikachu	since you don't define any additional functions
2015-10-02 21:32:00	joobus	which wrapping?
2015-10-02 21:32:12	llua	foo() { ...}; foo "$@"
2015-10-02 21:32:19	joobus	ok
2015-10-02 21:32:23	Mikachu	just do
2015-10-02 21:32:26	Mikachu	#compdef _mycommand

2015-10-02 21:33:17	joobus	I was following this: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide06.html#l177
2015-10-02 21:33:44	joobus	figured I would do it proper.  this script was just to get my feet wet.
2015-10-02 21:35:15	Mikachu	that guide kinda skips over the easy parts, heh
2015-10-02 21:35:32	llua	yea, starting out with a command that has subcommands is kinda hard.

2015-10-24 13:42:47	carstenh	viccuad: if you search for _functions in zshall(1), then you will find the description of the builtin hook functions for precmd, preexec and so on.  You could implement the same thing (except that you have to loop yourself) in prompt_viccuad_precmd() and and then add prompt_viccuad_precmd_mutt and so on to an array $prompt_viccuad_precmd_functions

2015-10-25 19:14:54	phy1729	I'm attempting to write a completion script for rcctl. It has subcommands and the trouble is that if -d or -f is used (before the subcommand) many of the subcommands are no longer options by the man page, but rcctl won't error. Is the usual route to take just ignore that detail or is there a way to coerce _arguments into giving more precise completions? man page for reference

2015-10-25 20:01:16	meiand	I use python with a virtual environment. After i switched to zsh from bash I now have to source the virtual environment again each time i install a new pip package, to have access to it from the cli. I can see the package with pip freeze, but the bin files are not available before i source the venvname/bin/activate again. Not a big problem, but kind of annoying, what might cause it?

2015-10-25 20:07:02	Han	meiand, that is typical for how zsh behaves. It keeps stuff in memory and doesn't read the current state again and again.
2015-10-25 20:07:37	Han	I don't know how to change that, I'm used to working with it.

2015-10-27 15:48:35	crdpink	a follow up would be can I write a post command hook that would just run dirs -v if the previous command was pushd/popd

2015-10-27 15:50:48	FoH	and likewise for popd

2015-10-27 19:13:07	Phantom7	1: I've got powerline statusbar working if I do `tmux` at prompt but not `tmux -CC`. 2:, I'd love to find some documentation about how to interpret the statusline (e.g. there's a 0* on LHS I can't understand as well as what seems like clock speed of 3 cores on RHS (but I have 4 cores!!) Any help would be appreciated

Alternatevly what's the right way to write ':subcommand:('"$actions"\)   where $subcmds should also be offered if there is no -d or -f on the line. Both $actions and $subcmds are arrays and $actions is used later.

2015-10-27 23:54:24	danielsh	sentor, I tested it yesterday and just setting the completer style in 'zsh -f' does do what I thought you wanted...
2015-10-27 23:55:22	danielsh	I also bind <TAB> to <complete-word> rather than <expand-or-complete> but I'm not sure that's relevant.
2015-10-27 23:55:42	wedens	can someone explain what this style does? zstyle ':completion:*:*:cd:*:directory-stack' menu yes select

2015-10-27 23:58:11	danielsh	wedens, this sets the 'menu' style to the array value (yes select) , ie, an array of length 2
2015-10-27 23:58:31	 *	wedens is trying to understand what all this copy-pasted from different configs styles do
2015-10-27 23:58:36	danielsh	"directory-stack" is a tag, i.e., "a kind of thing being completed"
2015-10-27 23:58:41	danielsh	(like "file" or "hostname" and so on)

2015-10-28 00:00:43	danielsh	so there the tag is "users" (and the context is ":completion::complete:ssh:option-l-1:users"), because after -l it completes usernames.

2015-10-28 06:03:56	zomb	sorry for all the question just want to learn and understand it
2015-10-28 06:04:27	llua	your initial shell exported PATH with a new value, by copying the original value and adding a section. once you started tmux, tmux started _another_ shell that does the same thing
2015-10-28 06:05:20	llua	so if you don't want duplicates in PATH, you have to check if it is already there or not, before doing that.
2015-10-28 06:05:40	llua	or, in zsh; you can use typeset -U.
2015-10-28 06:05:58	zomb	okay and when you say check if its there how can i do that ?
2015-10-28 06:06:57	zomb	yep i read about typeset -U that makes sense it keepsthe first occurrence of each duplicate value

2015-10-28 06:55:32	Mikachu	in like 13 years of using zsh, i have never seen anyone ask that, nor has it ever occurred to me, but no, i don't think you can hide the menu
2015-10-28 06:56:31	Mikachu	if you mean the regular listing, you said "selection", so if you want to disable menu selection, just remove the zstyle line that says something along the lines of "menu yes select" at the end

2015-10-28 06:57:11	tailgate	I tunred it off in bash accidentally and got used to it
2015-10-28 06:58:25	tailgate	is zstyle diffrent from zshrc?
2015-10-28 06:58:43	llua	it's something normally placed in an .zshrc.
2015-10-28 06:59:29	Mikachu	in zsh, 'menu selection' is a special mode of completion, where you have an interactive cursor move around in the menu listing
2015-10-28 07:00:14	tailgate	hmm. Well, I would like it to finish the completion even if it's ambiguous when I push TAB, and each TAB goes to the next completion
2015-10-28 07:01:57	Mikachu	the default mode (i think) does that if you press tab another time

2015-10-28 07:04:47	tailgate	yeah, it's sort of right
2015-10-28 07:05:06	Mikachu	actually setopt menucomplete does more completion sooner

2015-10-28 07:06:34	Mikachu	some of those are probably the default value though
2015-10-28 07:06:48	Mikachu	but those five together control all this behavior
2015-10-28 07:06:55	Mikachu	there's like 53^19 different results you can get
2015-10-28 07:07:15	Mikachu	oh there is also listambiguous

2015-10-28 07:08:28	Mikachu	there are _ in the word breaks in the manpage listings btw, so complete_in_word etc

2015-10-29 19:04:20	replicant	good evening. i'm working on getting a bash specific script to work, and one of the failing areas is that it uses bash's `complete` command, and i'm struggling to convert this line to zsh-compatibility. any direction, or what i should search for/look at for converting this? the line in question: `type _git &>/dev/null && complete -o default -o nospace -F _git g`
2015-10-29 19:04:22	replicant	thanks!
2015-10-29 19:06:08	llua	what does it do
2015-10-29 19:06:47	replicant	the full sampling that i'm working on converting for zsh usage: https://github.com/bruno-/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.bashrc#L204-L252

2015-10-29 19:07:13	replicant	sooo, you type gs, it completes to git status as an example
2015-10-29 19:07:52	replicant	started ureading up on compadd, but feel like there is more to do than convert that one line ;)

2015-10-31 12:16:31	llua	you added that?
2015-10-31 12:17:01	ft	zsh is a shell, not a terminal. There is no terminal description named "zsh".
2015-10-31 12:17:07	emitattuo	I think I was just following the instructions here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Command-line_shell#Changing_your_default_shell
2015-10-31 12:17:19	emitattuo	ft, that would explain why it's not working.

2015-10-31 12:18:32	emitattuo	in /etc/profile:30, there's actually a blank line.  line 29 has TERM=zsh
2015-10-31 12:18:37	ft	Or is arch still changing the list of files their zsh reads with their packages?
2015-10-31 12:18:56	emitattuo	I'm not sure.
2015-10-31 12:19:00	izabera	likely so
2015-10-31 12:19:07	llua	it does
2015-10-31 12:19:21	izabera	not sure about zsh but they do for bash
2015-10-31 12:19:33	llua	emitattuo: where in the instructions

2015-10-31 12:20:38	ft	.o( Because making a shell behave differently from any other binary of that program is totally reasonable )
2015-10-31 12:20:53	ft	Couldn't understand that years ago.
2015-10-31 12:20:56	ft	But whatever.
2015-10-31 12:21:26	llua	cat /etc/zsh/zprofile

2015-10-31 12:26:00	emitattuo	the other issue I have is when I backspace, it inserts a space and doesn't appear to delete the previous character.  However, internally, it works as it should - it just doesn't display the change right.
2015-10-31 12:26:51	emitattuo	Now instead of zsh: unknown terminal type, I get: "Error opening terminal: mate-terminal"
2015-10-31 12:27:28	emitattuo	when I try running a command like top.  ls and simple commands that don't change the whole screen still work.

2015-10-31 12:37:48	forflo	I wrote a little module and noticed a nasty undocumented behaviour in addhashnode2()
2015-10-31 12:38:03	forflo	the mailing list (zsh-workers) doesn't work

2015-10-31 12:44:34	forflo	I also wrote a nifty little module that lets you maintain a arbitrary number of lua interpreters embedded in zsh
2015-10-31 12:44:41	forflo	Anyone interested?

2015-10-31 13:09:42	forflo	izabera: I could send you the binary, but I don't think you would accept this so here are the build instructions.
2015-10-31 13:10:18	forflo	1) lua.c must reside in Src/Modules/ as well as the following file
2015-10-31 13:10:56	forflo	hastebin.com/bokukohako.
2015-10-31 13:12:02	forflo	2) Now you must add the line LIBS="$LIBS -llua" to configure.ac at line 760 (in the root of the repo)
2015-10-31 13:12:12	forflo	3) Run autoreconf
2015-10-31 13:12:25	forflo	If this emits an error run autoreconf -i
2015-10-31 13:12:40	forflo	4) Do $ make prep
2015-10-31 13:12:45	forflo	Then make
2015-10-31 13:13:40	forflo	You should now be the proud owner of the shared binary lua.so located in the modules directory
