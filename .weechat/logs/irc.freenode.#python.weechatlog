2015-12-08 18:44:52	ninebits	lol
2015-12-08 18:45:08	ninebits	infobob's some kind of bot?
2015-12-08 18:45:13	Vgr	yes
2015-12-08 18:45:14	ninebits	oh he's the lol bot.
2015-12-08 18:45:33	Vgr	ninebits: please don't use a bare except - if you need to catch KeyboardInterrupt, use 'except KeyboardInterrupt:' instead
2015-12-08 18:45:44	ninebits	ya, done those
2015-12-08 18:45:58	ninebits	i mean, using the bare except was my last ditch effort
2015-12-08 18:46:28	Vgr	I'm not seeing anything like you're describing over here (using 3.5.1rc1)
2015-12-08 18:46:32	ninebits	i'm looking for a way around what's happening there, and so far nobody else even acknowledges there's a prolem.
2015-12-08 18:46:37	ninebits	i'm on Windows 8
2015-12-08 18:47:22	Vgr	the only cause I can think of is something weird going on at a lower level

2015-12-08 18:47:28	ninebits	ya

2015-12-08 18:47:58	bedekelly_	ninebits what do you need a workaround for?
2015-12-08 18:48:06	z1haze	hypothetically, what would be the fastest way possible to check a massive list of doamins to see if they are actual domains? and how long would it take to check say.. 80,000
