2015-11-10 06:35:27	freddyb	maybe this template does not add rules yet
2015-11-10 06:35:41	freddyb	should be an assignment to awful.rules.rules, you can just do it yourself?
2015-11-10 06:35:47	freddyb	bbl
2015-11-10 06:36:04	cod3r	i think for elv's config there must be a diff way..
2015-11-10 06:36:23	cod3r	adding that in rc.lua

2015-11-25 13:29:12	spyroboy	blueyed, right but that doesn't help if someone tries to hijack your computer while it's running
2015-11-25 13:29:26	spyroboy	I guess you'd have to be present for it to boot
2015-11-25 13:29:34	spyroboy	but I've been looking at options for that.
2015-11-25 13:31:17	blueyed	spyroboy: don't get it - after unlocking the disk with your password, the wm would be started - you are then in charge of locking it etc.  E.g. on another VT it would not respawn the wm without a pwd (but have not tried).
2015-11-25 13:31:38	spyroboy	sorry my problem stems from a different problem I was trying to solve.
2015-11-25 13:31:43	blueyed	Do you know of good apps to move clients across X servers?  E.g. the thunderbird instance.
2015-11-25 13:32:01	spyroboy	hm. I don't know if that's possible.
2015-11-25 13:32:10	spyroboy	it would have to be an X proxy probably.

2015-12-02 05:19:07	spyroboy	you can acquire the X display via other means

2015-12-02 05:20:18	blueyed	Mine used to show this (at least on Ubuntu), too.
2015-12-02 05:20:25	spyroboy	yeah I use gdm
2015-12-02 05:20:50	spyroboy	I'd try to figure out what gdm does to report it I guess
2015-12-02 05:21:14	blueyed	I've noticed this because autorandr does not detect the display anymore (https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/issues/39).
2015-12-02 05:21:34	blueyed	Yeah, DM's usually use the C bindings probably.

2015-12-03 07:19:30	motdef	trying to stop that brief flicker you get on a window border when switching tags - any ideas? one idea i had is painting all unfocused window borders when a client receives focus instead of using the unfocus signal but it still looks like awesome paints the border more quickly than it unmaps the client
2015-12-03 07:26:33	motdef	thinking the solution would be to check that the newly focused client is mapped before changing any borders but i'm not sure how to make a function wait until it receives a signal before continuing

2015-12-05 00:17:42	shadowkyogre	Hi everyone! Still fiddling around with awesome. It's a nice break from the usual Compiz that I run everyday. Anyway, I was looking at the api and the tooltip source code to find out how I can have a "details" panel pop up that's aligned to the widget that it's connected to. I see that the tooltip sets its wibox position with self.wibox:geomtry({params here})
2015-12-05 00:18:06	shadowkyogre	but, when I try to do the same for a textbox (because I hope to attach this to an arbitrary imagebox, textbox, etc)
2015-12-05 00:18:15	shadowkyogre	I get "attempt to call a nil value"
2015-12-05 00:18:34	shadowkyogre	Let me go get the snippet from my rc.lua that's relevant
2015-12-05 00:20:45	shadowkyogre	https://ptpb.pw/gRf5/lua <- liens 36-50 are where I try to experiment with making a manual "poppy" that pops up to show more details on the window.
2015-12-05 00:21:21	shadowkyogre	Mostly so I can do things like quickly glance at the window class for a window that I want to write a rule for
2015-12-05 00:21:58	shadowkyogre	and set up things that tooltips are obviously not meant for (like shoving clickable widgets inside these)
2015-12-05 00:22:07	rivarun	shadowkyogre: on which line does your error originate?
2015-12-05 00:22:15	psychon	and what's the exact error message?
2015-12-05 00:22:25	psychon	oh, "attempt to call nil value"
2015-12-05 00:22:49	shadowkyogre	line 47, where I try to get the textbox's position and size on the screen
2015-12-05 00:22:50	psychon	title:geometry() should be the one
2015-12-05 00:22:57	psychon	a textbox doesn't have a position and size
2015-12-05 00:23:04	psychon	it can be visible at multiple places at once
2015-12-05 00:23:17	psychon	I think awfl.tooltip uses the current mouse position, no?
2015-12-05 00:23:29	shadowkyogre	yes, it uses the current mouse position
2015-12-05 00:24:09	psychon	ahh, it uses awful.placement.next_to_mouse() and then no_offscreen()
2015-12-05 00:24:20	psychon	can't you do the same?
2015-12-05 00:24:38	psychon	also, your title.poppy wibox needs a size
2015-12-05 00:25:17	psychon	the simplest thing that I can come up with right now:
2015-12-05 00:25:42	psychon	title.poppy:geometry({x = mouse.coords().x, y = mouse.coords().y})
2015-12-05 00:26:50	psychon	ohhhh
2015-12-05 00:26:59	psychon	if you really want to get the titlewidget's geometry:
2015-12-05 00:27:15	psychon	instead of title:buttons(awful.util.table.join(awful.button({}, 1, function() use the following:
2015-12-05 00:27:46	psychon	uhm... wait a second, I have to think a bit
2015-12-05 00:30:12	psychon	the "function()" gets replaced with "function(g)" and then g.x, g.y, g.width, g.height should be the information about the titlewidget (relative to the top-left corner of the wibox in which it is displayed)
2015-12-05 00:31:06	psychon	the position of that wibox should be g.drawable:geometry().x and g.drawable:geometry().y
2015-12-05 00:31:22	shadowkyogre	i
2015-12-05 00:31:25	shadowkyogre	whoops
2015-12-05 00:31:30	shadowkyogre	thought I typed in vim ^^;

2015-12-05 00:48:25	psychon	wibox() should be wibox({})
2015-12-05 00:49:38	psychon	and I don't think :get_preferred_size() returns a geometry
2015-12-05 00:49:55	psychon	yup, it returns two numbers (width, height)
2015-12-05 00:50:17	psychon	so: local width, height = testbox:get_preferred_size(mouse.screen) g.poppy:geometry({ height = height, width = width })
2015-12-05 00:50:23	shadowkyogre	gotcha. Fixed those and it's back to saying that there's a nil method on g.drawable when I try to call :geometry()
2015-12-05 00:50:43	psychon	nil method or nil object?
2015-12-05 00:50:51	psychon	(what's the exact message?)
2015-12-05 00:51:07	shadowkyogre	attempt to call a nil value (method 'geometry')
2015-12-05 00:51:49	psychon	hm, ok
2015-12-05 00:51:59	psychon	let's try this: g.drawable.drawin:geometry()

2015-12-05 02:19:24	psychon	nope, you cannot store properties on them (yet)
2015-12-05 02:19:55	psychon	can't you just use a global variable to save what you want to save? If you need some per-wibox info, use a table with the wibox as key and whatever you want to save as value
2015-12-05 02:20:30	shadowkyogre	true. Just trying to keep track of a few things if I draggle the window around.
2015-12-05 02:20:43	shadowkyogre	so that way it doesn't float out there in space
2015-12-05 02:21:02	shadowkyogre	which I do have coded up, but am moving it into own module to make sure I can use it in other places

2015-12-05 10:49:50	shadowkyogre	Hey everyone! So, random question: is it possible to retrieve the foreground of background widget? Reason I'm asking is that I need some tooltips to blend in depending on whether the item is focused or not (for tasklist and the taglist)
2015-12-05 10:53:03	shadowkyogre	https://ptpb.pw/G8Ky/lua <- when I uncomment line 32, it  causes all of that to break since the exception prevents reaching w:add(bgb)
2015-12-05 10:53:38	shadowkyogre	So far I haven't been able to get awesome to spew error notis or msgs regarding line 32
2015-12-05 10:54:14	shadowkyogre	but the reason why I was trying to see how that works was that I saw that background had a foreground_color property
2015-12-05 10:55:28	shadowkyogre	(yes, I know I should be using tooltip_border_color for this, but like I mentioned before, I need it to camoflauge with the widget since it's meant to be focus/selection sensitive)

2015-12-05 13:42:15	Yatekii	hey guys, I really love awesome thus far. one thing that bothers me tho is: sometimes (or even pretty often) when I scroll with my mousewheel, the page just randomly jumps back the other direction I scrolled :S any ideas?
2015-12-05 13:43:52	flappy	Yatekii: if what you mean by 'page' is the numbered workspaces, that's what happens when you scroll within a vacant spot on a workspace
2015-12-05 13:44:18	flappy	also happens when you scroll on top of the workspace #s
2015-12-05 13:45:30	Yatekii	flappy: no, sorry I was just browsing so I refered to program as page :S
2015-12-05 13:46:00	Yatekii	just within a program with a scrollbar

2015-12-05 13:47:22	flappy	so your browser randomly scrolls upwards?
2015-12-05 13:47:33	flappy	that sounds like mouse problems
2015-12-05 13:55:07	Yatekii	flappy: no, just when I scroll.
2015-12-05 13:55:10	Yatekii	and no it is not
2015-12-05 13:55:16	Yatekii	I use it with my mac/win too
2015-12-05 13:55:55	Yatekii	I wouldn't ask if I didn't know it's awesome

I'm having trouble figuring out what could be causing awesome to swallow up my mouse when I click on CopyQ's tray icon with my current config s: with the default config, the mouse works normally and I can see the main panel for copyq. Lemme go get my rc.lua to see what could help there.
2015-12-06 19:43:26	shadowkyogre	https://ptpb.pw/b8h1/lua <- here's my rc.lua, some of the additional stuff reffed in there's at https://github.com/ShadowKyogre/dotfiles

2015-12-08 13:16:11	blueyed	It still happens to me that awesome / X's input is completely frozen after I switch back to the VT - I am using two separate X instances for work and private stuff.
2015-12-08 13:16:49	blueyed	I can move the mouse cursor, but it does not change and the keyboard is completely "dead".
2015-12-08 13:17:39	blueyed	awesome on that VT cannot be killed normally, which would restart it in my session wrapper.

2015-12-08 13:28:12	Elv13	blueyed: have you tried to kill every single X apps starting from the one under the mouse followed by the last focused one then history? Maybe some apps just grab everything and lock other things
2015-12-08 13:31:21	blueyed	Elv13: there was only one client on the tag: urxvt where I started copyq from - which recently triggered the issue where awesome widgets cannot be clicked anymore.
2015-12-08 13:31:45	blueyed	Killing that one worked, but the X display did not change.
2015-12-08 13:32:55	Elv13	if you can reproduce it, X11trace will tell you everything you need to know (or psychon will)
2015-12-08 13:33:06	blueyed	awesome-client could help in general, but then there's https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/573 (feedback welcome!) and awesome itself is a zombie.
2015-12-08 13:34:04	blueyed	I cannot really.  Should I use X11trace now by default and then make use of it when it fails?
2015-12-08 13:35:50	blueyed	With "DISPLAY=:0 awesome" I got some "X error: request=ReparentWindow (major 7, minor 0), error=BadMatch (8)" errors, but still no input is accepted.
2015-12-08 13:38:55	blueyed	xtrace is from glibc?!
2015-12-08 13:41:20	Elv13	x11trace ~= xtrace
2015-12-08 13:42:06	Elv13	and x11trace produce enormous output files and slowdown everything, it is usually not a great idea to let it run
